                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "g. Distributor will at all times be and represent itself to be an independent distributor, not an agent or employee of Erchonia.",
                "changed_text": "g. Distributor will at all times be and represent itself to be an independent contractor, but Erchonia may exercise control over the means by which the distributor sells the product.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the distributor's status. While the contract states 'independent contractor,' the clause allowing Erchonia to control 'the means' implies an employer-employee relationship. This contradicts the legal definition of an independent contractor, where control over the method of work is limited. This misclassification can lead to disputes under labor laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA); relevant state labor laws regarding independent contractor classification.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "d. Distributor shall maintain appropriate records concerning the sales of the Products. Such records shall include at a minimum the name, address and telephone number of each customer, the date of sale, a listing of the Products sold to each customer. Upon Erchonia's request, Distributor shall provide Erchonia with regular periodic reports including the information described in this paragraph. All such information shall be available for inspection by Erchonia, upon reasonable notice. Distributor shall also maintain such other records related to sales of the Products as Erchonia may reasonably request.",
                "changed_text": "d. Distributor shall endeavor to maintain some sales records. The specific information maintained and provided to Erchonia will be at the distributor's discretion and convenience. Erchonia may inspect what records are available, but no specific record-keeping is mandated.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the obligation of 'Distributor shall maintain appropriate records concerning the sales of the Products', thus making record maintenance optional and discretionary. This would cause the agreement to fail, since in every U.S. state, and at the federal level, it is a requirement to keep good records when making sales.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws requiring accurate sales record-keeping for tax and regulatory compliance, including potential conflicts with IRS regulations.",

Erchonia Warranty and Warranty Limitations: Other than the written warranty accompanying the Products, Erchonia DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.",
                "changed_text": "b. Erchonia Warranty and Warranty Limitations: Erchonia provides a limited warranty as described in the product documentation. All other warranties, including merchantability, are applicable only at the consumer's explicit request and Erchonia's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the warranty terms to suggest that standard implied warranties are optional and subject to Erchonia's approval. This is a misrepresentation of warranty law in the United States, since implied warranties such as merchantability are automatically applicable unless explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed in a manner compliant with state and federal law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2, governing sales warranties, and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which regulates consumer product warranties in the U.S.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Developer agrees to perform the Services hereunder solely as an independent contractor. The Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, franchise, agency, employer/employee, or similar relationship between the Parties, or as authorizing either Party to act as the agent of the other. The Developer is and will remain an independent contractor in its relationship to the Client.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer agrees to perform the Services hereunder solely as an independent contractor. The Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, franchise, agency, worker, or similar relationship between the Parties, or as authorizing either Party to act as the agent of the other. The Developer is and will remain an independent contractor in its relationship to the Client.",
                "explanation": "By including \"worker\" in the list of relationships that the agreement explicitly is *not*, and using \"worker\" interchangeably with \"independent contractor\" later in the agreement, this creates a contradiction. In many jurisdictions, the legal definition of \"worker\" can encompass both employees and independent contractors, leading to potential misclassification under employment law.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), IRS guidelines on independent contractor classification, various state employment laws.",

                "original_text": "The Developer hereby warrants and represents that following delivery of the Application System to the Client (which shall be deeded to occur only on the date the Web Application is uploaded to the AWS for distribution) pursuant to Exhibit A (the \"Support Period\"), the Application will be free from programming errors and defects in workmanship and materials, and will conform to the specifications of Exhibit A. If programming errors or other defects are discovered during the Support Period, the Developer shall promptly remedy those errors or defects at its own expense. The developer will fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer hereby warrants and represents that following delivery of the Application System to the Client (which shall be deeded to occur only on the date the Web Application is uploaded to the AWS for distribution) pursuant to Exhibit A (the \"Support Period\"), the Application will be substantially free from programming errors and major defects in workmanship and materials, and will generally conform to the specifications of Exhibit A. If programming errors or other defects are discovered during the Support Period, the Developer shall attempt to remedy those errors or defects. The developer will consider fixing any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"free from programming errors and defects\" to \"substantially free from programming errors and major defects\" and changing \"promptly remedy those errors or defects at its own expense\" to \"attempt to remedy those errors or defects\" significantly weakens the warranty. Also, changing 'will fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed' to 'will consider fixing any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed' weakens the commitment to bug fixing after the original warranty has passed. This creates ambiguity regarding the developer's obligations and could be interpreted as a deviation from standard software warranty practices and consumer protection laws, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "original_text": "The Client may assign this Agreement freely, in whole or in part. The Developer may not, without the written consent of the Client, assign, subcontract, or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Developer may transfer the right to receive any amounts that may be payable to it for its Services under this Agreement, which transfer will be effective only after receipt by the Client of written notice of such assignment or transfer.",
                "changed_text": "The Client may assign this Agreement with notification, in whole or in part. The Developer may not, without the written consent of the Client, assign, subcontract, or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Developer may transfer the right to receive some amounts that may be payable to it for its Services under this Agreement, which transfer will be effective only after verbal notice to the Client of such assignment or transfer.",
                "explanation": "By changing “freely” to “with notification,” the clause now implies there are limitations to the client's ability to assign the contract, which is not clarified. By changing 'any amounts that may be payable' to 'some amounts that may be payable,' the clause now implies that not all amounts can be assigned. This goes against typical contract assignment practices, and deviates significantly, making enforcement complex.",

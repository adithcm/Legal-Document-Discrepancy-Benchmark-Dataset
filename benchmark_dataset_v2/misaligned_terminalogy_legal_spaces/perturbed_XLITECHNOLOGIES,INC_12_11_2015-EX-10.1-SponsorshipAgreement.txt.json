                "original_text": "WCC, in performing under this Agreement, shall act as and be an independent contractor, and this Agreement is not intended to and does not create in any manner a principal-agent, employer-employee, partnership or joint venture relationship between WCC and XLI. Neither party shall have the right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, expressed or implied on behalf or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party in any manner.",
                "changed_text": "WCC, in performing under this Agreement, shall act as and be an independent contractor; however, XLI maintains the right to direct WCC's actions to ensure brand alignment, and this Agreement is not intended to and does not create in any manner a principal-agent, employer-employee, partnership or joint venture relationship between WCC and XLI. Neither party shall have the right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, expressed or implied on behalf or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party in any manner.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'however, XLI maintains the right to direct WCC's actions to ensure brand alignment,' the clause now contradicts the definition of an independent contractor. Independent contractors typically have autonomy in how they perform their work, while this modification suggests a level of control by XLI that could blur the lines between an independent contractor and an employee, which has different legal implications under labor laws.",

Consequently, WCC hereby assigns to XLI all goodwill and all other rights developed in connection with WCC's use of XLI's trademarks which shall inure to the benefit of XLI.",

Consequently, WCC hereby assigns to XLI some goodwill and all other rights developed in connection with WCC's use of XLI's trademarks which shall inure to the benefit of XLI.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'all goodwill' to 'some goodwill' creates ambiguity regarding the extent of the assignment. Trademark law requires a clear transfer of goodwill along with the trademark to maintain its validity. This alteration undermines the legal integrity of the trademark assignment, potentially invalidating it under trademark law because there is not a proper transfer of ALL goodwill.",

In the event either party experiences financial difficulties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'becomes bankrupt or insolvent' with 'experiences financial difficulties' broadens the grounds for termination in a legally vague manner. 'Bankrupt or insolvent' have specific legal definitions, triggering certain rights and obligations under bankruptcy law. 'Financial difficulties' is subjective and lacks a precise legal meaning, making it difficult to enforce and potentially conflicting with bankruptcy laws that provide structured protection during insolvency.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Intellectual Property Rights\" means know-how, inventions, patents, patent rights, and registrations and applications, renewals, continuations and extensions thereof, works of authorship and art, copyrightable materials and copyrights (including, but not limited to, titles, computer code, designs, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialog, catch phrases, concepts, artwork, animation, sounds, musical compositions, graphics and visual elements, audio-visual effects and methods of operation, and any related documentation), copyright registrations and applications, renewals and extensions thereof, mask works, industrial rights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, trademark registrations and applications, renewals and extensions thereof, trade secrets, rights in trade dress and packaging, publicity, personality and privacy rights, rights of attribution, paternity, integrity and other similarly afforded \"moral\" rights, and all other forms of intellectual property and proprietary rights recognized by the U.S. laws, and other applicable foreign and international laws, treaties and conventions.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Intellectual Property Rights\" means tangible personal property, including but not limited to, physical prototypes, models, and marketing materials. This definition specifically excludes all intangible rights such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, regardless of their recognition under U.S. or international laws.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal definitions of Intellectual Property Rights. The modified definition restricts intellectual property to tangible personal property, explicitly excluding intangible rights. This contradicts established intellectual property law, creating ambiguity about the protection of intangible assets crucial to the agreement's subject matter.",

                "explanation": "The change from \"Intellectual Property Rights\" to \"physical manifestations or tangible results\" in defining Licensee Materials creates a conflict.

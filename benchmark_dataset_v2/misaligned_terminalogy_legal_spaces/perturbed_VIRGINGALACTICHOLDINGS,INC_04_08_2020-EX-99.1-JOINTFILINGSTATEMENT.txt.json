                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of only those who directly benefit from said amendments.",
                "explanation": "This statement contradicts SEC regulations regarding joint filings, which require all parties involved to be responsible for amendments. By stating that only those who 'directly benefit' are responsible, it creates ambiguity and potential non-compliance, as the definition of 'direct benefit' is not legally defined within the context of SEC filings, therefore leaving it open to subjective interpretation.

                "explanation": "This contradicts the established legal standard of 'reason to believe' regarding accuracy in joint filings. Removing responsibility even when there's a reason to suspect inaccuracy undermines the due diligence expected under securities law. The phrase 'general accuracy' in place of 'completeness and accuracy' further reduces the legal obligation.",

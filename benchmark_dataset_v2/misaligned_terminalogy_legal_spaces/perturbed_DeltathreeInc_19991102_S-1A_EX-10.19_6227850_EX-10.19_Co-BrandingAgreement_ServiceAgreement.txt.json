                "original_text": "WHEREAS, DeltaThree is a leading on-line provider of Internet Protocol (IP) communications services and utilizes the Internet and networks based on IP to provide telecommunications products and services;",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, DeltaThree is a provider of digital communications and utilizes the Internet and networks to provide communications products and services;",
                "explanation": "The term 'Internet Protocol (IP) communications services' has a specific technical and legal meaning. Replacing it with 'digital communications' introduces ambiguity. This could create disputes over the scope of services DeltaThree is obligated to provide, particularly regarding adherence to specific IP standards and protocols.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vague terminology conflicts with requirements for clarity and specificity in contract law, potentially undermining enforceability under New York contract law.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Internet Protocol (IP) communications services\" to \"general communication services\" broadens the definition considerably. This introduces ambiguity about the specific technology and infrastructure used, potentially allowing DeltaThree to deviate from industry-standard IP protocols. This creates uncertainty about DeltaThree's responsibilities regarding network performance, security, and interoperability.",
                "contradicted_law": "This modification undermines the principle of specific performance in contract law, as the obligations related to the 'DeltaThree Network' become less defined. Enforceability is impacted under New York contract law.",

                "changed_text": "PrimeCall shall procure on behalf of DeltaThree an access number for users of the Calling Card.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specification of \"toll-free '800'\" removes the obligation for the access number to be toll-free, shifting costs to the user of the Calling Card. While not illegal, it introduces a significant change to the service being offered, conflicting with the assumed understanding of a 'calling card' and creates a misrepresentation of the product.",
                "contradicted_law": "This might constitute a breach of implied warranty and misrepresentation under New York's Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as it alters a fundamental characteristic of the service without explicit notice.",

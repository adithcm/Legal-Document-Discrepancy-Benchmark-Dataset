                "original_text": "For the License Term and within the Licensed Territory, Producer hereby grants to ConvergTV a right and license to Distribute the program, file or video listed on the Deal Terms above (the \"Program\") consisting of (check one) ¨ episodes (series) or x one-offs, for unlimited runs for the License Term through ConvergTV channels and/or other distribution outlets, in accordance with the License Rights. The terms \"License Term\", \"Licensed Rights\", and \"Licensed Territory\" shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference. As used in this Agreement and this license, the term \"Distribute\" includes, but is not limited to, any and all License Rights specified in the Deal Terms, all rights of distribution, the right to copy and reproduce the Program, the right to create derivative works of the Program for the purpose of creating branding elements and short form promotional materials (\"Promotional Works\"), the right to sell copies, the right to import and export the Program and the Promotional Works, the right to display the Program and Promotional Works publicity, the right to transmit the Program and Promotional Works through any transmission or delivery method that exists today, or that is created in the future, to any number of devices or users, including transmission through simultaneous delivery or streaming, and the right to sublicense and/or assign some or all of these rights to others.",

The terms \"License Term\", \"Licensed Rights\", and \"Licensed Territory\" shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference. As used in this Agreement and this license, the term \"Share\" includes, solely the right to make available the Program through streaming services, excluding any right to copy, reproduce, create derivative works, sell copies, import, export, display publicity, transmit through any transmission or delivery method, sublicense, or assign these rights to others.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Distribute\" is specifically defined to include a wide array of rights, including reproduction, modification, and sublicensing. Replacing it with \"Share\" and restricting the definition to only streaming significantly narrows the scope of rights granted, creating a contradiction and potential ambiguity. This allows ConvergTV to argue they are only allowed to stream the file, but not sub-license it for terrestrial, cable, or satellite use.",

                "original_text": "Producer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any breach or alleged breach of the warranties made by it in this Agreement.\n\nProducer shall further indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV and its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, and their respective successors or assigns, from all costs, expenses and damages arising from any costs, errors, omissions, slander, losses, liability or for any other cause as a direct or indirect result of the Distribution, transmission or publication of the Producer's Program or content.",
                "changed_text": "Producer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV from all direct costs, expenses and tangible damages arising from a judicially determined breach of the warranties made by it in this Agreement. \n\nProducer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless ConvergTV from all costs, only arising from a direct result of the Distribution, transmission or publication of the Producer's Program or content. This excludes errors, omissions, slander, losses, liability or for any other cause that is not considered direct.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause is broad, covering a wide range of potential liabilities. The modified clause limits indemnification to \"direct costs, expenses and tangible damages\" resulting from a \"judicially determined\" breach, thereby adding significant constraints. Additionally, the removal of indemnity for errors, omissions, slander, losses or liabilities and damages limits what is covered and makes enforcement less certain. This adds further constraints and un-clarity.",

                "original_text": "All questions with respect to the construction of this Agreement, and the rights and liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida. The Parties also agree that the venue for this Agreement shall be in the County of Brevard, Florida. The Parties expressly waive any claim to jurisdiction in any federal or other state forum or venue in any other county or place. In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties hereto, including, but not limited to, any action at law or in equity, including any action for declaratory or injunctive relief, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all of his or her actual attorney's fees and costs in bringing, prosecuting, or defending said action.",
                "changed_text": "All questions with respect to the subjective interpretation of this Agreement, and the assumed liabilities of the Parties hereto, shall be decided internally by ConvergTV. In the event of any situation, circumstance or controversy between the Parties hereto, including but not limited to the color of the sky, the prevailing Party may be entitled to decide on their own who the prevailing party is, unless stated otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Florida law and Brevard County as the governing jurisdiction and venue. The modification replaces this with a provision giving ConvergTV internal and final decision making power. This directly conflicts with standard legal practice and jurisdictional rules. The modified clause introduces absurdity to create unclarity.",

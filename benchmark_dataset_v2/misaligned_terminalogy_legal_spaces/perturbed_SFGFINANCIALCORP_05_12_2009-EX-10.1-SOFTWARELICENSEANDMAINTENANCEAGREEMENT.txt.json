                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.1 \"AFFILIATE\" means, in the case of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business or investment entity, a  different business entity or other individual that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries controls, or is controlled by, or  is under common control with the business entity.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"AFFILIATE\" means, in the case of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business or investment entity, a  different business entity or other individual that directly controls the business entity.",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes both direct and indirect control through intermediaries, aligning with standard corporate law definitions of 'affiliate'. The modified definition removes 'indirect control' and 'through one or more intermediaries', which contradicts standard legal interpretations and narrows the scope, potentially excluding entities that would normally be considered affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "viii. The Licensee acknowledges and understands that occasionally using the Licensed Technology triggers and constitutes a  renewed assumption of such liabilities and risk.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that each instance of accessing the licensed technology constitutes a renewed assumption of liabilities and risks. By changing \"accessing\" to \"occasionally using,\" the condition is obscured, creating uncertainty about how often use must occur to trigger the renewed assumption. This introduces a legal contradiction because it's not clear when the licensee is actually assuming liabilities and risks.",

                "changed_text": "Termination of this Agreement by either party will be the sole remedy for breach and will replace any other right or remedy of such party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause correctly states that termination is a non-exclusive remedy, meaning other legal remedies are still available. The modified clause changes 'nonexclusive' to 'sole', directly contradicting the original intent and accepted legal practice. Making termination the sole remedy limits the parties' options for recourse in the event of a breach, which is a significant legal alteration.",

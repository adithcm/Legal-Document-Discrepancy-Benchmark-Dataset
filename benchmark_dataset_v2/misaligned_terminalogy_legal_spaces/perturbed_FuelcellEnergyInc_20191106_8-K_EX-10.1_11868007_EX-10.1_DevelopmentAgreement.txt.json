                "original_text": "\"Affiliate(s)\" means any legal entity which, directly or indirectly, at the time in question, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the designated Party. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" is defined as direct or indirect ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting interest or economic interest in the controlled entity or such other relationship whereby the controlling entity determines or has the right to determine the majority of the Board of Directors or an equivalent governing body of the controlled entity.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate(s)\" means any legal entity which, directly or indirectly, at the time in question, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the designated Party. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" is defined as influence over the business decisions of the controlled entity.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces the legally precise definition of 'control' (50% or more ownership or right to determine the majority of the board) with a vague 'influence over the business decisions'. This creates ambiguity because 'influence' is subjective and lacks a statutory benchmark, contradicting standard corporate law definitions.",

                "changed_text": "“Gross Negligence” means actions that cause substantial damage.",
                "explanation": "The revised definition omits the key elements of 'serious and substantial deviation from a diligent course of action' and 'reckless disregard'. It reduces the threshold for gross negligence to merely causing substantial damage, potentially encompassing acts that would not traditionally meet the legal standard for gross negligence due to lack of intent or recklessness. This creates uncertainty in determining liability.",

Neither Party will furnish, deliver, or release the technology, services, software, or commodities made available to it hereunder to any individual, entity, or destination, or for any use, except in full accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and requirements of the United States with regard to export control and trade sanctions. Both Parties agree and understand that each will be responsible for ongoing compliance with all such applicable laws, regulations, and requirements. It will be a material breach if a Receiving Party takes any action or uses any of a Disclosing Party's information in any manner which would violate United States laws, regulations, or requirements restricting the export, re-export, transfer or release to certain entities or destinations, including to persons within the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, or to unrelated Third Parties.",
                "changed_text": "17.03 Export Control and Trade Sanctions. The Parties will endeavor to comply with export control and trade sanction laws. It will only be considered a material breach if a Party deliberately violates export regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates strict compliance with US export control laws. The revised clause softens the obligation to 'endeavor to comply' and limits material breach to 'deliberate' violations. This contradicts the strict liability nature of many export control regulations, where even unintentional violations can result in significant penalties. This weakens the enforceability of the export compliance provision.",

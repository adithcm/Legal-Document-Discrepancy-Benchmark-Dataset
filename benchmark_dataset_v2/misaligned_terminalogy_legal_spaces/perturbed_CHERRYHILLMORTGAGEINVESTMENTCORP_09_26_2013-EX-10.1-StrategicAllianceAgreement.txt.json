                "original_text": "Base Servicing Fee: As to any Mortgage Loan and any Collection Period, an amount equal to the product of the Base Servicing Fee Rate, the UPB of that Mortgage Loan as of the related Measurement Date and 1/12 or, for the first Collection Period, the number of days in such Collection Period divided by 360; provided, however, that payment of the Base Servicing Fee for any delinquent Mortgage Loan shall be suspended unless and until Freedom Mortgage recovers the amount thereof from payments in respect thereof from the related mortgagor or the amount thereof is otherwise recovered from liquidation of the related property.",
                "changed_text": "Base Servicing Fee: As to any Mortgage Loan and any Collection Period, an amount to be determined at Freedom Mortgageâ€™s discretion, taking into account the Base Servicing Fee Rate, the UPB of that Mortgage Loan as of the related Measurement Date. Payment of the Base Servicing Fee for any delinquent Mortgage Loan may be adjusted at Freedom Mortgage's convenience.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a clear formula for calculating the Base Servicing Fee. The modification introduces ambiguity by making the fee calculation discretionary and altering the payment terms for delinquent loans. This contradicts the initial intent for consistent valuation, and by extension impacts how Cherry Hill accounts for its assets, potentially creating instability.",

                "explanation": "The original definition provides objective, measurable criteria for triggering a Standby Trigger Event, based on HUD and Ginnie Mae regulations. The modification introduces a subjective, discretionary standard, where Cherry Hill can declare a Standby Trigger Event based on its own assessment of risk. This could contradict the intent of protecting Cherry Hill's investment based on objective criteria and could be abused.",

                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of 'Law' to include guidelines and perceived decrees, which are not legally binding.

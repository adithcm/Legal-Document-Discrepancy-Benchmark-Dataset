            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "EmployeeCo agrees to provide to the Operating Company and its affiliates the Services and such other services as may be determined by the Parties from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "EmployeeCo agrees to provide to the Operating Company and its affiliates the Services, but further services shall be at EmployeeCo's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'as may be determined by the Parties' to 'at EmployeeCo's discretion,' the contract now contradicts the initial agreement that services are mutually determined. This could lead to disputes over the scope of services EmployeeCo is legally obligated to provide, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principle of mutual agreement.",

                "original_text": "The Operating Company shall reimburse EmployeeCo for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by EmployeeCo in connection with performing its obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to:\n\n(a) salaries of the Services Employees;\n\n(b) the cost of employee benefits for the Services Employees, including 401(k), pension, bonuses and health insurance benefits (whether through insurance policies provided by third-parties or self-insurance);\n\n(c) costs associated with workers' compensation claims and other disputes or liabilities associated with the Services Employees;\n\n(d) severance costs with respect to any terminated Services Employees; and\n\n(e) all sales, use, employment, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable from time to time with respect to the Services.",
                "changed_text": "The Operating Company shall consider reimbursing EmployeeCo for expenses. Reimbursement may include:\n\n(a) Salaries, potentially;\n\n(b) Possibly employee benefits;\n\n(c) Liabilities, depending on Operating Company funds;\n\n(d) Severance costs, maybe;\n\n(e) Vaguely similar taxes, perhaps.",
                "explanation": "The original text created an obligation to reimburse specific costs. The modified version makes reimbursements discretionary, creating uncertainty and contradicting the original intent. The vague phrasing surrounding each cost opens the door for disputes and is not specific or enforceable.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state. Each Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Colorado and to venue in Denver, Colorado.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be informally guided by the laws of Colorado, except when not. Each party reluctantly submits to the jurisdiction of wherever.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly established Colorado law as governing and set jurisdiction in Colorado courts. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity by stating 'informally guided,' 'except when not,' and 'wherever,' contradicting the original intent. This uncertainty could nullify the choice-of-law and jurisdiction clauses, causing issues for enforcement.",

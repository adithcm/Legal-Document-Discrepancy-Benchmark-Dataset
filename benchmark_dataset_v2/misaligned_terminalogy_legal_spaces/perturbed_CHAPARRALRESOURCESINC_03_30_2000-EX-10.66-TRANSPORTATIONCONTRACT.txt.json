                "original_text": "1.1 The Company, at the expense and on the instructions of the Principal, shall      arrange transportation for export in batches to the far abroad of crude oil      (\"Commodity\") belonging to the Principal and shall provide such other      services in connection therewith as are provided in this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 The Company, at the expense and on the instructions of the Principal, shall arrange transportation for export of crude oil. The Company will dictate the amount to be transported per batch. The oil(\"Commodity\") can belong to any subsidiary or affiliate of the Principal. The Company shall provide such other services in connection therewith as are provided in this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Commodity\" is altered so that the definition of 'Commodity' is broadened beyond what is owned by the Principal. The company can now arbitrarily change shipment sizes at its discretion. The new terms contradict the original intent, creating uncertainty around the company's obligations and the extent of the Principal's control over its own product.",

The      Company shall ensure that (i) during the Principal Period, the quality of      Commodity delivered at the relevant delivery point shall be REBCO, and (ii)      during the Secondary Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the CPC      Terminal shall be Karakuduk Commodity for segregated batch deliveries or      shall be CPC Blend for deliveries for which segregated batch delivery is      not available.",
                "changed_text": "3.1  Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Principal shall deliver to the Company Commodity pursuant to this Contract; the quality of such to be 'generally merchantable'. The Company shall ensure that (i) during the Principal Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the relevant delivery point shall be 'adequate', and (ii) during the Secondary Period, the quality of Commodity delivered at the CPC Terminal shall be 'acceptable'.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the specific quality standards with vague terms like “generally merchantable”, “adequate”, and “acceptable”, the amendment creates ambiguity. This change is a legal contradiction because the original contract clearly defined specific standards, which are now replaced by uncertain terms, impacting enforceability.",

                "explanation": "By replacing the fixed fee of $1.00 with a 'customary' fee that may be adjusted at the company's discretion, this amendment introduces a significant legal contradiction. The original contract provided a clear, defined compensation, which is a standard requirement for contract enforceability. The term customary is vague, and the arbitrary adjustment clause makes it unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "End User is the final purchaser or licensee who has acquired Products for its own internal use and not for resale, remarketing or redistribution. An entity that performs stocking, sparing or warehousing activities for third parties or procures Cisco Products, Services or Software for delivery to third parties is not an End User.",
                "changed_text": "End User is the final purchaser or licensee who has acquired Products. An entity that performs stocking, sparing or warehousing activities for third parties or procures Cisco Products, Services or Software for delivery to third parties is also considered an End User.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'End User' now includes entities that perform stocking, sparing, or warehousing activities, directly contradicting the original definition. This creates uncertainty as standard distribution agreements do not recognize this definition, leading to disputes over end-user pricing and support obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Product means, individually or collectively as appropriate, Hardware. Software is not included as a product for this agreement. Documentation, developed products, supplies, accessories, and goods to the foregoing, listed on the then-current published Global Price List, are considered Products.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Product' is redefined to explicitly exclude 'Software,' which contradicts numerous sections of the agreement that reference 'Products' including licensed software. This creates ambiguity about whether software is subject to purchase, warranty, or support terms, which would usually be included with a 'Product'.",

                "changed_text": "Services means only pre-approved support calls. All other aspects of Cisco's SmartNet family of packaged service offerings, as well as such other service offerings as Cisco makes available for purchase by Distributor on Cisco's Wholesale or Global Price List do not apply.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the definition of 'Services' to include only 'pre-approved support calls,' the clause now excludes other aspects from Cisco's SmartNet and global offerings. This conflicts with the broader service offerings implied throughout the agreement, particularly concerning support, maintenance, and updates, potentially leading to disputes over the scope of service obligations.",

                "original_text": "All prices are exclusive of taxes, duties, or other governmental charges levied on or in respect of the product or delivery thereof. Buyer shall pay or reimburse Seller for such taxes, duties or charges.",
                "changed_text": "All prices are exclusive of most taxes, duties, or other governmental charges levied on or in respect of the product or delivery thereof, unless otherwise specified. Buyer is not required to pay or reimburse Seller for unspecified taxes, duties or charges.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity regarding which taxes, duties, and charges the buyer is responsible for. By adding 'unless otherwise specified' and 'unspecified', it contradicts the original clear allocation of responsibility. Tax laws require clarity in determining tax liability, which this change undermines.",

Buyer assumes all risk whatsoever as a result of the use of the products purchased, whether used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process.",
                "changed_text": "WARRANTIES There are no warranties which extend beyond the simple description on the face hereof, and Seller makes no warranty, expressed or implied, of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for any particular use or otherwise, except that the products sold hereunder shall approximately meet Seller's applicable standard specifications or such other specifications as may be notified by Seller to Buyer. Buyer assumes all risk whatsoever as a result of the safe use of the products purchased, whether used singly or in combination with other substances or in any process.",
                "explanation": "The original text provided limited but clear specifications for the product. By changing 'description' to 'simple description' and 'meet' to 'approximately meet', the standard is weakened.

Buyer shall not be relieved of any obligations to accept or pay for products by reason of any delay in delivery or dispatch. Furthermore, no liability shall result to either party for delay in performance or non-performance of an obligation hereunder (except an obligation to make payment) in whole or in part caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the party affected, including but not limited to acts of God, terrorist activity, transportation failure, breakdowns, equipment failure, shortage or inability to obtain product or raw material for product, or good-faith compliance with any governmental order or request (whether valid or invalid) . Regardless, however, of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any such circumstances, if for any reason supplies of product or feedstock for making product, from any of Seller's existing sources are curtailed or are inadequate to meet Seller's own requirement and/or its obligation to its customers, Seller's obligation to deliver product during such period shall be reduced to the extent necessary, in Seller's sole judgment, to apportion fairly among Seller's own requirements and its customers (whether under contract or not) such products as received and as may be available in the ordinary and usual course of Seller's business from any existing sources of supply at the location(s) from which deliveries like those covered hereby are normally shipped. Seller shall not be obligated to purchase or obtain product, or feedstock to make product, to replace deliveries omitted or curtailed under this Paragraph.",
                "changed_text": "FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE Failure by Seller to deliver on a specific date shall not entitle Buyer to repudiate this Agreement. Buyer shall not be relieved of all obligations to accept or pay for products only by reason of extreme delay in delivery or dispatch. Furthermore, no liability shall result to either party for severe delay in performance or total non-performance of an obligation hereunder (except an obligation to make payment) in whole or in part caused by circumstances greatly beyond the control of the party affected, including but not limited to acts of God, terrorist activity, transportation failure, breakdowns, equipment failure, shortage or inability to obtain product or raw material for product, or good-faith compliance with any governmental order or request (whether valid or invalid) . Regardless, however, of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any such circumstances, if for any reason supplies of product or feedstock for making product, from any of Seller's existing sources are possibly curtailed or might be inadequate to meet Seller's own requirement and/or its obligation to its customers, Seller's obligation to deliver product during such period shall be reduced to the extent necessary, in Seller's possible judgment, to apportion reasonably fairly among Seller's own requirements and its customers (whether under contract or not) such products as received and as may be available possibly in the ordinary and usual course of Seller's business from any existing sources of supply at the location(s) from which deliveries like those covered hereby are normally shipped. Seller shall probably not be obligated to purchase or obtain product, or feedstock to make product, to replace deliveries omitted or curtailed under this Paragraph.",
                "explanation": "This alteration significantly weakens the Failure in Performance clause. By including the phrases 'extreme delay','severe delay','greatly beyond the control' 'possibly curtailed', the objective standards for excusing performance are replaced with highly subjective ones. This contradicts general contract principles that favor definiteness. This creates uncertainty about when the buyer's obligations are excused and when the seller is excused from their liability.",

Maimon recognizes and acknowledges that by reason of his retention by and service to the Company, Maimon will have access to certain confidential and proprietary information relating to the Company's business, which may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, trade \"know-how,\" product development techniques and plans, formulas, customer lists and addresses, financing services, funding programs, cost and pricing information, marketing and sales techniques, strategy and programs, computer programs and software and financial information (collectively referred to as \"Confidential Information\"). Maimon acknowledges that such Confidential Information is a valuable and unique asset of the Company and covenants that he will not, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company, at any time use any Confidential Information or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation except in connection with the performance of his duties for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company's policies regarding Confidential Information.",

Maimon recognizes and acknowledges that by reason of his retention by and service to the Company, Maimon will have access to certain confidential and proprietary information relating to the Company's business, which may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, general business knowledge, product development techniques and plans, formulas, customer lists and addresses, financing services, funding programs, cost and pricing information, marketing and sales techniques, strategy and programs, computer programs and software and financial information (collectively referred to as \"Confidential Information\").

                "explanation": "The modification redefines the scope of 'Confidential Information' by replacing 'trade \"know-how\"' with 'general business knowledge' and stating it is a 'non-unique asset'. This contradicts the typical understanding and legal protection afforded to trade secrets and confidential business information, undermining the enforceability of the confidentiality clause under trade secret laws.",

Maimon warrants that to the best of Maimon's knowledge, there is no other contract or duty on Maimon's part now in existence inconsistent with this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company..",

                "explanation": "Changing the non-compete duration from two (2) years to two (2) months creates a conflict and makes the term unreasonably short under New York law. Non-compete agreements are only enforceable if they are reasonable in time and geographic scope. A two-month restriction for a CEO is likely to be deemed insufficient to protect the company's legitimate business interests, rendering the clause unenforceable.",

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice.

The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'five days prior written notice' to 'zero days prior written notice' for termination due to CEO's inability to perform duties (including death or disability) introduces a contradiction. Under general contract law principles and potentially employment laws, 'zero days notice' may be deemed unconscionable, especially given the circumstances triggering the termination, and conflicts with standard practices of providing reasonable notice for termination.",

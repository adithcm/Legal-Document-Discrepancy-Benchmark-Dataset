                "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" shall mean, as to any Party as a Recipient, (a) all non-public written, graphic, oral, electromagnetic or other information (including technical, financial and business information regarding models, market studies, business plans. clients' names, reports, plans. projections, data or any other information) relating to the business, strategy, prospects or plans of the other Party or any of the other Party's Affiliates and (b) any reproductions, copies, notes, analyses, work papers. compilations, studies, interpretations or any other document or information derived from any of the foregoing.",

However, information that is merely interesting to a Party shall not be considered Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence introduces ambiguity into the definition of 'Confidential Information.' By stating that merely 'interesting' information is excluded, it contradicts the broad scope established in the original definition, which covers 'all non-public' information. This creates uncertainty about what exactly constitutes Confidential Information, making enforcement difficult.",

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, do or cause to be done any of the following in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b) take any other action that, if taken by a Person subject to United States law, would violate the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to. at all times, comply in all respects with all applicable Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided such compliance does not impede the profitability of the Project. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party (the \"Relevant Party\") shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, do or cause to be done any of the following in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) directly or indirectly through any other Person. pay, offer to pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any monies or anything of value to any official or employee of any Government Authority or any political party or candidate for political office for the purpose of illegally or improperly inducing or rewarding any action by such official, employee or candidate favorable to the Relevant Party or any of its Affiliate or (b) take any other action that, if taken by a Person subject to United States law, would violate the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'provided such compliance does not impede the profitability of the Project' creates a direct conflict with the obligation to comply with all applicable laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It suggests that illegal activities are permissible if they increase profits, undermining the legal compliance requirement.",

                "explanation": "This contradicts the requirement that amendments be made 'pursuant to an instrument in writing signed by both of them'. Oral agreements are generally unenforceable for significant contractual changes, particularly when the original agreement requires written modifications. This change introduces uncertainty about the validity of any amendments and violates basic contract law principles.",

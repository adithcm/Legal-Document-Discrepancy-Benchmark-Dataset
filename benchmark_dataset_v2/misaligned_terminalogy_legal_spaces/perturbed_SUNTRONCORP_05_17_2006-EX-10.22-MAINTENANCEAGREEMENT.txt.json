                "original_text": "\"Required Capital Contributions\" means some combination of (a) one or      more unrestricted cash contributions to the capital of one or more of the      Borrowers made by the Investor, and/or (b) one or more Qualified      Subordinated Loans made by the Investor to one or more of the Borrowers, in      each case as required under Section 2 below, in any or all cases, in an      aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 during the term of this      Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"Required Capital Contributions\" means discretionary contributions to the capital of one or more of the Borrowers made by the Investor, and/or unsecured loans made by the Investor to one or more of the Borrowers, in an amount to be determined at the Investor’s sole discretion. The aggregate amount can exceed $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement if the Investor deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Required Capital Contributions' specifies a maximum amount of $5,000,000 and certain acceptable forms. The modified definition makes the contribution amount discretionary and removes restrictions on the form of the contribution, directly contradicting the established limitations. This would create confusion and potential unenforceability.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor’s obligation to provide funds is primarily suggestive and not limited to any specific amount during the term of this Agreement. The Investor may opt to provide Required Capital Contributions, but is not legally obligated.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a limit of $5,000,000 for the Investor's obligation. The changed text suggests there is no obligation, creating a direct contradiction. By changing 'shall be limited' to 'not limited' creates vagueness and opposes the legally binding sense of the original text. This discrepancy undermines the enforceability of the capital contribution requirement.",

                "original_text": "Specific Performance and Liquidated Damages. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that if a Maintenance Event of Default (as defined in Section 10 below) has occurred and is continuing hereunder, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, shall have the non-exclusive right to obtain specific performance of the obligation of the Investor to make the Required Capital Contributions. If specific performance is not a remedy then available to the Agent and the Lenders for any reason, the Agent and the Lenders will suffer damages in an amount which, due to the special nature of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, will be impracticable or extremely difficult to ascertain.",
                "changed_text": "Specific Performance and Potential Remedies. The Investor acknowledges that the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, may explore available options if a Maintenance Event of Default (as loosely described in Section 10 below) occurs. If the agent feels damages are sustained, the parties may agree to negotiate compensation. Any enforcement will be subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines the Investor’s agreement to specific performance as a remedy for failing to make Required Capital Contributions. The modified text replaces 'shall have the non-exclusive right to obtain specific performance' with an option to 'explore available options', and replaces liquidated damages with a 'mutual agreement' to 'negotiate compensation'. This change undermines the Agent's legal recourse and introduces uncertainty about enforcement, as it now depends on future negotiation rather than a defined contractual obligation. The original text used the word damages which implies a financial agreement, but changed to 'negotiate compensation', which implies a wide arrangement with no monetary amount.",

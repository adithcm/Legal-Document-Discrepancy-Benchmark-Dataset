                "original_text": "By this Agreement the Participants enter into a general Joint Venture (the \"Joint Venture\") in accordance with the laws of The State of Florida. The rights and obligations of the JVP will be as stated in the applicable legislation of The State of Florida except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "By this Agreement the Participants enter into a specific Joint Venture (the \"Joint Venture\") in accordance with the laws of The State of Florida. The rights and obligations of the JVP will be determined exclusively by the terms of this Agreement, notwithstanding any conflicting legislation in The State of Florida.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'general' to 'specific' joint venture, implying it's governed solely by the contract, conflicting with Florida law which regulates all joint ventures. The original text acknowledges Florida law while the changed text attempts to supersede it.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'Potentially' and 'subject to future agreements,' the purpose becomes vague. This creates uncertainty. Under Florida contract law, clear purpose are required.",

                "explanation": "By removing the examples of force majeure and the requirement to communicate the event and mitigate it, it gives the participant sole discretion, conflicting with the standard legal definition that requires events to be unforeseen, uncontrollable, and external. It creates uncertainty regarding when force majeure applies.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of this Section 1.1(b), (i) the \"Market Price\" of any Products & Services shall mean the price for such Products & Services established by Constellation as the competitive market price at which such Products & Services are to be made available to Constellation's customers with a similar anticipated load profile within a specified utility service territory.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Section 1.1(b), (i) the \"Market Price\" of any Products & Services shall mean the price determined at Constellationâ€™s sole discretion, irrespective of competitive market conditions or prices offered to other customers.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Market Price\" refers to a competitive market price. The modified definition allows Constellation to set the price at its sole discretion, contradicting the implied fairness and competitiveness inherent in the term \"market price.\" This could violate regulations requiring fair pricing practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-level fair trade practices and anti-profiteering laws.",

Constellation will provide, or cause to be provided, all of the Services included in the Products & Services in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, orders, treaties and other requirements of federal/national, state/provincial and local governments and agencies thereof, including but not limited those relating to labor, health, safety and the environment.",
                "changed_text": "All Services included in the Products & Services shall be performed at a level that Constellation deems satisfactory. Constellation will provide, or cause to be provided, all of the Services included in the Products & Services in compliance with only those laws, rules, regulations, codes, orders, treaties and other requirements of federal/national, state/provincial and local governments and agencies thereof that it deems commercially reasonable to follow.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific standard of care (same as other third parties) and full legal compliance. The modified text introduces subjectivity (\"deems satisfactory\", \"commercially reasonable\"), potentially allowing Constellation to provide substandard service and selectively comply with legal requirements. This contradicts the original intent and standard business practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Ohio consumer protection laws and environmental regulations, depending on which laws are deemed 'not commercially reasonable' to follow.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A Party shall be in default hereunder if any of the following events shall occur (each of such events being an \"Event of Default\"): (i) Such Party fails to perform timely any of its material obligations hereunder and such default shall continue for a period of sixty (60) days following receipt by such Party of written notice from the other Party specifying such default; provided that, if the default specified in such notice is curable but of a nature such that it cannot be cured through the exercise of reasonable diligence within the sixty (60) day cure period, then such sixty (60) day cure period shall be extended to a period as is reasonable (but in no event more than sixty (60) days, subject to delay due to force majeure) to cure such default pursuant to a mutually agreed plan of cure, provided that the non-performing Party has proceeded at all times and is continuing to proceed in a diligent and reasonable manner to cure;",
                "changed_text": "A Party shall be in default hereunder if any of the following events shall occur (each of such events being an \"Event of Default\"): (i) Such Party fails to perform timely any of its material obligations hereunder, and such default shall immediately constitute an uncured Event of Default, regardless of whether the other party provides written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a notice period and a chance to cure a default. The modified text eliminates both, making any failure to perform a material obligation an immediate and uncured default. This contradicts standard legal practice, which usually provides opportunities to rectify breaches of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts Ohio contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing, especially concerning notice and cure provisions.",

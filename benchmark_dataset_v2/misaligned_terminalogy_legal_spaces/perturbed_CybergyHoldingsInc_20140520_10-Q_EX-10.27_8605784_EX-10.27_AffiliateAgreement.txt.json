MA shall not hold itself out as an employee or agent of Company other than for the limited purposes of marketing the Technology. No debts or obligations shall be incurred by either party in the other party's name, including execution of the Client Registration Agreements. MA shall have the right to perform certain services for its Clients, such as training, installation and non-contract support and bill its Clients directly for such services. MA specifically understand and agrees that it shall not be treated as an employee with respect to such services as are performed for any applicable tax purposes; and it is further agreed that this Agreement shall not bring MA under the provisions of any local, state, provincial, federal, national, and international regulation wherein coverage thereunder is based upon the relationship of employer and employee.",

MA shall act as an agent of Company with full authority to represent Company in all marketing and sales related activities.

                "explanation": "The text now states that 'MA shall act as an agent of Company with full authority to represent Company in all marketing and sales related activities' which contradicts the classification as an 'independent contractor'. This creates uncertainty under agency and employment laws. Generally an agent has a fiduciary duty to their principal, the company, and independent contractors do not. This contradiction in terms would make the contract unenforceable.",

If any legal action or proceeding is initiated, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all attorney fees, court costs, and expenses in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.",
                "explanation": "The governing law is now stated as the laws of the State of California, while also requiring MA to consent to jurisdiction in Nevada. This creates a conflict of law issue. It is unclear which state's laws will govern the contract, creating ambiguity and potential legal challenges.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'that is either identified as or would reasonably be understood to be confidential and/or proprietary' from point C, the contract fails to protect all information disclosed by the company.

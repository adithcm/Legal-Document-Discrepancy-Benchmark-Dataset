In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based on the sales revenues and fees received from the entire combination or kit.",

Trade discounts, refunds, returns and recalls, and sales taxes will not be deducted. In the event that Company sells a LICENSED PRODUCT(S) in combination with other ingredients or substances or as part of a kit, the NET SALES for purposes of royalty payments shall be based on the Companyâ€™s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'NET SALES' is altered to conflict with standard accounting practices and legal interpretations. By removing the standard deductions and making the royalty calculation discretionary for combination sales, it introduces ambiguity and potential underreporting of royalties, creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The term PATENT RIGHT(S) normally implies all the rights associated with the referenced patents, but selectively limits that. This introduces ambiguity as to which specific patents are included under this agreement and contradicts the clear definition typically required in intellectual property law.

                "explanation": "The changes weaken the indemnification clause by replacing mandatory terms with discretionary ones. Replacing 'requires' with 'encourages', 'shall indemnify' with 'should consider to indemnify', and 'shall be considered' with 'may be considered' introduces significant ambiguity and reduces the enforceability of the indemnification. This contradicts the principle of clear contractual obligations and creates uncertainty regarding liability protection, undermining the security that such clauses are supposed to provide. ",

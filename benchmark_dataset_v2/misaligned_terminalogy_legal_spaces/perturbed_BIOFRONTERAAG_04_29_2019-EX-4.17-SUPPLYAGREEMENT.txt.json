                "original_text": "1.9 Specifications \"Specifications\" means, with respect to the Products, the critical quality standards that include test attributes, analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria and Manufacturing procedures for which such Product should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use and conform to quality standards approved by Governmental and Regulatory Authorities and as provided in the NDA for the Products, and required for the Manufacture and supply of such Product(s).",
                "changed_text": "1.9 Specifications \"Specifications\" means, with respect to the Products, the suggested guidelines for product features, quality attributes and manufacturing procedures that the Supplier may aim for, but is not required to meet, during the Manufacture and supply of such Product(s).",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts established FDA regulations (cGMPs) and the definition's own reference to NDA requirements, which mandate adherence to strict, approved quality standards. By weakening 'Specifications' to suggested guidelines, the contract introduces ambiguity and non-compliance with pharmaceutical manufacturing standards, creating uncertainty about whether products meet required quality levels under the law.",

                "original_text": "5.3 Conformity with FDA Regulations and cGMPs. Subject to CUTANEA's compliance with the provisions set forth in Section 5.2 and Section 5.4 hereof, Supplier warrants that all Products Manufactured, held for sale, sold and shipped pursuant to this Agreement shall have been Manufactured and shipped by Supplier in compliance with applicable FDA regulations and current Good Manufacturing Practices as that term is defined under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "5.3 Conformity with FDA Regulations and cGMPs. Supplier will attempt to adhere to applicable FDA regulations and general manufacturing suggestions but does not guarantee compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices as that term is defined under the Act. Supplier's best effort is sufficient for conformance.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts the requirement for pharmaceutical manufacturers to adhere to cGMPs, as mandated by the FDA. By stating that the Supplier only attempts to adhere and their best effort is sufficient, the clause suggests that compliance is not a strict obligation, which is a clear violation of federal law. This introduces uncertainty in enforcing product quality standards.",

                "original_text": "6.1 Initiating and Effecting Recall. Supplier, as the NDA holder for the Product, shall make all decisions with respect to any complaint or \"adverse drug experience\", or any recall, market withdrawal or any other corrective action related to any Product. Supplier shall be responsible for processing and submitting to the applicable authorities or agencies all reports of adverse drug experiences and Product complaints in accordance with applicable Acts.",
                "changed_text": "6.1 Initiating and Effecting Recall. In cases of serious complaints, the Parties should mutually agree with respect to any \"adverse drug experience\", or any recall, market withdrawal or any other corrective action related to any Product. Mutual consent must be reached before communicating with Governmental or Regulatory Authority. Supplier shall work with CUTANEA when processing and submitting to the applicable authorities or agencies all reports of adverse drug experiences and Product complaints in accordance with applicable Acts.",
                "explanation": "FDA regulations and guidance dictate that the NDA holder (Supplier) has the ultimate responsibility and authority to make recall decisions and report adverse events. This change makes the recall process contingent upon mutual agreement with CUTANEA, which is legally problematic as it dilutes the Supplier's mandated responsibility and could delay or obstruct necessary corrective actions, potentially endangering public health. It shifts the unilateral decision making required by law to mutual agreement, thus creating a potential conflict with FDA requirements.",

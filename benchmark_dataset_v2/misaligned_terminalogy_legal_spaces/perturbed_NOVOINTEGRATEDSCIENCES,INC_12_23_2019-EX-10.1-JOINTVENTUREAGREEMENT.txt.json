                "original_text": "NVOS and HGF covenant and agree to make their best efforts to fully develop the Primary Projects as well as all projects associated to this agreement as per this agreement at all times faithfully, honestly and diligently perform or cause to be performed their obligations hereunder and to continuously exert best efforts to promote and enhance the business and in that regards they hereby covenant and agree, so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, to operate the business, as to preserve, maintain and enhance the reputation of NVOS and HGF through the Company.",
                "changed_text": "NVOS and HGF covenant and agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to fully develop the Primary Projects as well as all projects associated to this agreement as per this agreement at all times faithfully, honestly and diligently perform or cause to be performed their obligations hereunder and to exert some effort to promote and enhance the business and in that regards they hereby covenant and agree, so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, to operate the business, as to preserve, maintain and enhance the reputation of NVOS and HGF through the Company.",
                "explanation": "Replacing “best efforts” with \"commercially reasonable efforts\" and \"some effort\" significantly lowers the standard of performance required. \"Best efforts\" is often interpreted as requiring a party to do everything within their power, while \"commercially reasonable efforts\" is a more relaxed standard. Additionally, \"some effort\" is not legally descriptive and can cause confusion.",

                "original_text": "The Parties shall negotiate in good faith and make every effort to settle any dispute, or claim, that may arise out of, or relate to, the Agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, an aggrieved Party shall, if he intends to proceed further in terms of Section 21.2 hereof, advise all other Parties in writing that negotiations have failed and that he intends to refer the matter to mediation in terms of Section 21.2.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall attempt to negotiate and make some effort to settle any dispute, or claim, that may arise out of, or relate to, the Agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, an aggrieved Party shall, if he intends to proceed further in terms of Section 21.2 hereof, advise all other Parties in writing that negotiations have failed and that he intends to refer the matter to mediation in terms of Section 21.2.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"negotiate in good faith and make every effort\" to \"attempt to negotiate and make some effort\" weakens the obligation to genuinely try to resolve disputes. 'Good faith' has a legal definition that requires honest and reasonable dealing, which 'attempt' and 'some effort' do not meet, thus causing legal uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties agree to maybe defend, potentially indemnify, and possibly save one another harmless from certain claims, demands, actions, losses, damages, costs, charges, liabilities and some expenses, potentially including legal fees of some kind perhaps arising out of or maybe in connection with each parties' activities conducted pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Using words such as \"maybe\", \"potentially\", and \"perhaps\" makes the indemnification clause extremely vague and unenforceable. The terms \"defend\", \"indemnify\", and \"save harmless\" have specific legal meanings. The modified language creates ambiguity about the parties' obligations and the scope of indemnification, going against the standard definition.",

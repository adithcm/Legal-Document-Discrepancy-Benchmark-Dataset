                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Technical Infrastructure Maintenance Agreement covers applicable items that make up the underlying technical infrastructure that is required to run an application. This would include items such as hardware, operating system, network connections, etc.",
                "changed_text": "General IT Support Agreement covers necessary components for application functionality. This may encompass hardware, operating system elements, and network interfaces.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Technical Infrastructure Maintenance Agreement' is replaced with 'General IT Support Agreement,' making the scope vague. By replacing the phrase 'items such as hardware, operating system, network connections, etc.' with 'may encompass hardware, operating system elements, and network interfaces', the definition becomes less precise, increasing uncertainty in enforcement. The term 'Technical Infrastructure' has a specific meaning, changing to a vague description.",

                "changed_text": "MMMW may choose to: repair malfunctioning hardware using components; or substitute the hardware.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'new or serviceable used parts' with 'components' and removing the detailed description of the replacement hardware's condition ('in good working order, cleaned, lubricated, adjusted and tested'), the obligation on MMMW becomes less clear, creating a contradiction. This change contradicts the original intent to provide hardware in a thoroughly checked condition, now opening to interpretation.",

                "original_text": "MMMW warrants that the Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition provided it is:\n\n               1) continuously subject to MMMW's inspection and acceptance of                   the hardware for service; and\n\n               2) subject to normal use and conditions. MMMW's sole and                   exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its                   option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory                   operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the                   conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt                   submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the                   hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "changed_text": "MMMW ensures that the IT components are functional, provided that:\n\n               1) MMMW inspects and accepts hardware; and\n\n               2) components are used according to guidelines. MMMW's liability is limited to repairing or replacing non-functional components. Said obligation is subject to Sections 3, 4, and 5, including notification to MMMW of any problems.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition' to 'IT components are functional' reduces the defined standard of performance. Replacing 'normal use and conditions' with 'used according to guidelines' gives MMMW more latitude to deny warranty claims based on subjective interpretations of guidelines. These changes introduce legal contradictions in the implied warranties and standard of acceptable performance.",

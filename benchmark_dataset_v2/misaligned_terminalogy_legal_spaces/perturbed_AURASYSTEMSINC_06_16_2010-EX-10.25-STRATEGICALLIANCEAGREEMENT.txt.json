Confidential Information does  not, however, include any information which the recipient can establish (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain  prior to the time of disclosure by the discloser; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the discloser to  recipient through no fault or breach of recipient; (iii) is already in the possession of recipient without restriction on use or disclosure at the time of  disclosure by discloser as shown by recipient's files and records prior to the time of the",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Confidential Information' is altered to be inconsistent with common legal interpretations and best practices. By changing 'all know-how' to 'some of know-how' and removing the requirement for explicit marking or reasonable notice for information to be confidential, it creates uncertainty about what exactly constitutes confidential information. Additionally, changing exceptions (i), (ii), and (iii) to their opposite cases leads to uncertainty about what constitutes confidential information, as previously agreed upon.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes 'shall warrant' to 'may warrant', making the warranty discretionary. The removal of the requirement to include a copy of the End User Warranty creates a contradiction and uncertainty, as the existence and terms of the warranty are now unclear and unenforceable. Also, the period for warranty decreased from 'thirty-six (36) months' to 'twelve (12) months'.",

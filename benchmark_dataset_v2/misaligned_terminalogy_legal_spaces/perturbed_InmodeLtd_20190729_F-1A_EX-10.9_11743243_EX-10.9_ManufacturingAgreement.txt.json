                "original_text": "Contractor is authorized to purchase materials using standard purchasing practices including, but not limited to acquisition of materials recognizing Economic Order Quantity, ABC buy policy and long lead time components management, in order to meet the requirements of Customer's orders and forecasts.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor is authorized to purchase materials using purchasing practices they deem appropriate, including acquisition of materials using any inventory level management policy, in order to meet the requirements of Customer's orders and forecasts.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'standard purchasing practices' and mentions 'Economic Order Quantity' (EOQ) which has a specific meaning. The modified text broadens this to 'purchasing practices they deem appropriate' and removes the reference to EOQ, instead using 'any inventory level management policy.' This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard business practices expected, creating uncertainty about inventory management and opens the door for the contractor to use any system regardless of cost-effectiveness.",

                "changed_text": "\"LLI\" shall mean materials the contractor deems necessary for the manufacture and supply of Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines LLI as 'Long Lead Item materials', which is commonly understood to mean items that take a significant amount of time to procure. The modified text changes this to 'materials the contractor deems necessary'. This broadens the definition, potentially including items that are not actually long lead items and gives the contractor excessive discretion, contradicting standard supply chain definitions.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor shall maintain quality assurance standards, and Seller's Quality Assurance, Control and Inspection shall be compliant with standards the Contractor deems appropriate during the Terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with 'ISO 13488 standards', which is a specific and well-defined quality management system for medical devices. The modified text removes the reference to ISO 13488 and replaces it with 'standards the Contractor deems appropriate'. This introduces ambiguity and allows the contractor to deviate from industry-standard practices, which creates uncertainty about the level of quality assurance and could be considered a breach of reasonable care.",

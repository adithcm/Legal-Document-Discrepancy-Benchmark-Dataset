                "original_text": "1.1 \"Confidential Information\" of a party shall mean any information disclosed by that party to the other party pursuant to this Agreement which is in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form. Confidential Information may also include oral information disclosed by one party to the other pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Confidential Information\" of a party shall mean any information disclosed by that party to the other party pursuant to this Agreement which is in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form. Confidential Information includes only physical data and excludes any oral information disclosed by one party to the other pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By excluding oral information from the definition of 'Confidential Information,' the contract contradicts common legal interpretations and practices regarding confidential agreements. Many jurisdictions recognize oral agreements and disclosures as confidential under certain circumstances. This alteration creates uncertainty regarding the protection of oral disclosures made during the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over the enforceability of confidentiality provisions.",

                "original_text": "5.3 Special Pricing. Notwithstanding the JRVS Price, special pricing on any one of the Products may be extended to the Distributor, in JRVS sole discretion, in situations where special pricing is necessary for the Distributor to obtain sale of the Products to a Customer. If JRVS elects to extend such special pricing, it will issue a confidential meet comp quote number documenting the special price quoted.",
                "changed_text": "5.3 Special Pricing. Notwithstanding the JRVS Price, special pricing on any one of the Products may be extended to the Distributor, at JRVS sole discretion and unwritten will, in situations where special pricing is necessary for the Distributor to obtain sale of the Products to a Customer. If JRVS elects to extend such special pricing, it will only be documented within JRVS internal systems.",
                "explanation": "The adjustment indicates that special pricing will now solely be stored in JRVS's internal systems, there is a potential conflict of interest. By not recording the special price given to the 'Distributor', the lack of transparency could cause distrust between the parties. Furthermore, there is no paper trail to protect the distributor should legal issues arise.",

JRVS MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO THE DISTRIBUTOR OR CUSTOMERS. 10.2 Warranty Period. JRVS shall NOT provide a warranty of any kind for each of the Products against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service from the date of delivery to the Distributor.",

JRVS MAY OFFER WARRANTIES TO THE DISTRIBUTOR OR CUSTOMERS AT ITS DISCRETION. 10.2 Warranty Period. JRVS shall provide a conditional warranty to each of the Products against defects in material and workmanship under specific use cases from the date of delivery to the Distributor.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'makes no warranties' to 'may offer warranties' creates a contradiction regarding warranty obligations. While initially disclaiming all warranties, the modified text suggests JRVS could offer them. The added sentence provides a 'conditional warranty', but the 'specific use cases' are undefined creating uncertainty. This ambiguity undermines the original disclaimer and complicates the warranty terms, leading to potential disputes under sales and warranty laws.",

                "original_text": "Net Revenue\" shall mean gross receipts collected by Company or Reseller from the distribution of Company Products, [less third party commissions, equipment sales, delivery costs, taxes, refunds, and credits.",
                "changed_text": "\"Net Revenue\" shall mean gross receipts collected by Company or Reseller from the distribution of Company Products, less only direct costs associated with the sale, as determined by the Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Revenue' provides a detailed and objective calculation. The modified version replaces this with a subjective calculation based on 'direct costs' determined at the 'Company's discretion.' This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard accounting practices and potentially revenue recognition principles, which require clear and consistent calculation methods. This could be seen as revenue manipulation.",

                "explanation": "This change shifts the responsibility for warranties entirely to the Reseller and removes the Company's oversight. This contradicts consumer protection laws that often hold manufacturers liable for product defects, regardless of reseller representations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear and unconditional obligation for the Company to indemnify the Reseller. The modification makes the indemnification discretionary and removes the guarantees of defense and holding harmless. This significantly weakens the Reseller's protection and introduces uncertainty in enforcement, contradicting the original intent of the clause and industry standards for reseller agreements.",

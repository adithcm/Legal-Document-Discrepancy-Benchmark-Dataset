                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement, including its attachment and order acknowledgments under the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between Distributor and NETGEAR with respect to the purchase, resale and distribution of the Products and is governed by the laws of the State of California except that body of law dealing with conflicts of law.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement, including its attachment and order acknowledgments under the Agreement, constitutes the entire understanding between Distributor and NETGEAR with respect to the purchase, resale and distribution of the Products and is governed by the laws of the State of California, including its body of law dealing with conflicts of law.",
                "explanation": "The term 'agreement' was replaced with 'understanding'. Under California law, specifically contract law, 'agreement' has a specific legal meaning involving offer, acceptance, and consideration. Replacing it with 'understanding' introduces ambiguity, as 'understanding' is a more informal term that may not meet the legal requirements for a binding contract. Additionally, the exclusion of conflict of law has been inverted to be included, which changes how legal conflicts will be handled.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Neither party is liable for its failure or delay to perform its obligations under the Agreement due to strikes, wars, revolutions, acts of terrorism, fires, floods, explosions, earthquakes, shortages in labor, components or materials, government regulations, or other causes beyond its control.",
                "changed_text": "Neither party is generally liable for its failure or delay to perform its obligations under the Agreement due to major strikes, declared wars, violent revolutions, direct acts of terrorism against the party, large fires, significant floods, major explosions, severe earthquakes, extreme shortages in labor and critical components, new government regulations, or arguably unavoidable causes.",
                "explanation": "Several key terms related to 'force majeure' have been modified to introduce ambiguity and conflict with standard legal interpretations. 'Strikes' becomes 'major strikes,' implying a threshold of impact. 'Wars' are qualified as 'declared wars', excluding undeclared conflicts. 'Government regulations' becomes 'new government regulations', opening to interpretation to challenges based on pre-existing laws. The modifier 'arguably unavoidable' weakens the standard of 'beyond its control'. All these changes make it harder to claim force majeure.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without prior written permission from the other party, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without such permission will be voidable.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be assigned by either party with notification to the other party, permission for which will not be required unless it significantly impacts the other party's business interests. Any attempt by either party to assign any right, or delegate any duty or obligation which arises under the Agreement without proper notification may be challenged.",
                "explanation": "The clause regarding assignment has been significantly altered. The original requires 'prior written permission' which cannot be 'unreasonably withheld.' The modified text only requires 'notification' and allows for assignment unless it 'significantly impacts' the other party's 'business interests', creating a vague and subjective standard compared to the legal standard of 'unreasonable'. Furthermore, 'voidable' becomes 'may be challenged', reducing the certainty of the original clause.",

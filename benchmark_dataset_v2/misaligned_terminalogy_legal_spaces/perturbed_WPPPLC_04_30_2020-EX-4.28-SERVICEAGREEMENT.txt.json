                "explanation": "The exclusion of trade secrets from the definition of \"Confidential Information\" introduces a legal contradiction. Trade secrets are legally protected under both UK and US law. By removing 'trade secrets,' the contract now provides less protection than legally required, leading to potential disputes and unenforceability regarding trade secret misappropriation.",

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.",

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make a discretionary payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu). The amount and timing of this payment are at the Company's complete discretion, considering business needs and Executive's performance.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the clause regarding Payment in Lieu (PILON) to make it 'discretionary' contradicts employment law principles that require clarity and fairness in termination payments. By not defining how the discretionary payment is determined, the executive has no calculable recourse if they consider they were not treated fairly, or not properly compensated according to similar roles or notice periods.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'reasonable in their application' to 'purely optional' directly contradicts the legally enforceable nature of protective covenants. Protective Covenants/Restrictive Covenants are only enforceable if they are reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate business interests. This modification makes them unenforceable by design, negating their purpose and creating a conflict with standard business practices and related law.",

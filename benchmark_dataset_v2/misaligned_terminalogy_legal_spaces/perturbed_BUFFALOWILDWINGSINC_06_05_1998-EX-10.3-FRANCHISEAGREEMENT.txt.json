                "explanation": "The original term **\"maintenance\"** has a specific legal and accounting definition, whereas the modified term **\"general upkeep\"** is more ambiguous. The second change allows **\"upkeep and equipment costs\"** to be used for **\"remodeling, modernization, or redecoration expenditures,\"** which contradicts standard accounting practices that separate these categories.",

Such guidance will be based on our experience in operating and franchising Restaurants and an analysis of the costs of such products and prices charged for competitive products. You will not be obligated to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right to determine the prices to be charged from time to time by the Franchised Restaurant and no such advice or guidance shall be deemed or construed to impose upon you any obligation to charge any fixed, minimum or maximum prices for any product offered for sale by the Franchised Restaurant.",
                "changed_text": "We may from time to time advise or offer guidance to you relative to prices for the food and other products offered for sale by the Franchised Restaurant that in our judgment constitute good business practice. You are expected to align prices with our recommendations as part of the franchise agreement. You will still have the right to propose prices and can charge prices that you see fit.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction regarding price setting. Initially, the franchisee has the 'sole right to determine the prices.' However, the altered language states franchisees are 'expected to align prices' with franchisor guidance. While stating that 'you can charge prices that you see fit', this expectation could be interpreted as a form of price control, contradicting antitrust laws that protect franchisees rights regarding price setting.",

                "original_text": "You will promptly notify us of any claim, demand or cause of action based upon or arising from any attempt by any other person, firm or corporation to use the Marks or any colorable imitation of the Marks. You shall also notify us of any action, claim or demand against you relating to the Marks within ten (10) days after you receive notice of said action, claim or demand. Upon receipt of timely notice of an action, claim or demand against you relating to the Marks, we and our affiliate shall have the sole right and duty to defend any such action.",
                "changed_text": "You will promptly notify us of any claim, demand or cause of action based upon or arising from any attempt by any other person, firm or corporation to use the Marks or any colorable imitation of the Marks. You are required to notify us of significant legal events that we deem necessary. Upon notification, we will have the sole right to defend any such action.",
                "explanation": "The term 'any action, claim, or demand against you relating to the Marks' is a broad, well-understood legal term. Replacing it with 'significant legal events that we deem necessary' is ambiguous and shifts the power of deciding what constitutes a reportable event to the franchisor. By removing the franchisee's right to have duty to defend an action, this may violate trademark law by not enforcing your trademark vigorously. This creates legal uncertainty and reduces franchisee autonomy in protecting the brand. The second change eliminates our affiliate's right to defend any action.",

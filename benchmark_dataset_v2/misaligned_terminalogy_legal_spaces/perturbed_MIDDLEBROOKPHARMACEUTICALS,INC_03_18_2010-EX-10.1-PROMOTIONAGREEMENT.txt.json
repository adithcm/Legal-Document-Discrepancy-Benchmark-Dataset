                "original_text": "The terms as used in this Agreement will have the meanings as follows:\n\n(a)  \"Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx\" means the total actual number of MOXATAG prescriptions filled in  the US during the applicable Promotional Measurement Period and written by DD Target Segment Prescribers as  stipulated by the Prescriber Data.",
                "changed_text": "The terms as used in this Agreement will have the meanings as follows:\n\n(a)  \"Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx\" means an estimated number of MOXATAG prescriptions predicted to be filled in  the US during the applicable Promotional Measurement Period and projected by DD, irrespective of the Prescriber Data.",
                "explanation": "The original definition relies on 'actual number' and 'Prescriber Data', aligning with standard practice. The modified definition introduces 'estimated number' and disregards 'Prescriber Data,' creating ambiguity about the basis for calculating 'Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx'. This contradicts the intention of using verifiable data for prescription counts, thereby affecting financial calculations based on this metric.",

                "original_text": "DD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers and agrees  to efficiently perform the services as described in EXHIBIT 4 in compliance with MBRK's policies and procedures, and  all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback  statutes, regulations contained in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) as they pertain to promotional activity of an  FDA-approved pharmaceutical product and the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's (\"OIG\") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (2003).",
                "changed_text": "DD shall use vaguely defined 'best efforts' to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers and agrees to perform the services as described in EXHIBIT 4 without specific regard to MBRK's policies and procedures, or any applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback statutes, regulations contained in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) as they pertain to promotional activity of an FDA-approved pharmaceutical product and the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's ('OIG') Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (2003).",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"commercially reasonable efforts\" with the broad term \"best efforts\" reduces the enforceability of DD's obligations. Omitting the compliance requirement undermines adherence to laws like anti-kickback statutes and FDA regulations, potentially making the contract unenforceable due to illegal activities. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' has legal precedent, while 'best efforts' is more subjective.",

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to render DD or any of its employees, agents, or  officers, an employee, joint venturer, agent, or partner of MBRK.",
                "changed_text": "In the performance of DD's obligations under this Agreement, DD shall be considered a general worker. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to render DD or any of its employees, agents, or officers, an employee, joint venturer, agent, or partner of MBRK.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'independent contractor' with 'general worker' creates a discrepancy with how labor laws classify workers. If DD is a 'general worker' but treated as an independent contractor, the contract conflicts with labor laws, which mandate specific protections and benefits for employees, such as tax withholding and insurance. Many states have laws that will classify an independent contractor based on their conduct rather than the wording used in the contract. This discrepancy could lead to legal challenges regarding worker classification.",

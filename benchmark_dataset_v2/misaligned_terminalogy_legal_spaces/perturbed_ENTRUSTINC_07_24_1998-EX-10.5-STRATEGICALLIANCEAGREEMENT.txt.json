            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Entrust\" shall mean ETI and all Subsidiaries thereof.",
                "changed_text": "\"Entrust\" shall mean ETI only.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'all Subsidiaries thereof' from the definition of \"Entrust,\" the contract now contradicts common legal and business understanding of how a company operates with its subsidiaries. This creates confusion because later clauses refer to 'Entrust' without clarifying whether they include subsidiaries, especially in the areas of liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of corporate law regarding subsidiaries and parent company responsibilities.",
                "location": "Article I - Definitions"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Patent License Term\" shall mean that period of time that ETI is a Subsidiary of  NTL.",
                "changed_text": "\"Patent License Term\" shall mean a period of five years from the effective date, regardless of ETI's subsidiary status.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly ties the Patent License Term to ETI's status as a subsidiary of NTL. The modification completely severs this tie, establishing a fixed term irrespective of ownership. This could be problematic under intellectual property law, where licenses are often tied to the duration of a business relationship or control.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law relating to the enforceability of agreements when a condition precedent (subsidiary status) is altered.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "NTL shall make all reasonable efforts to perform in all material respects the obligations required to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology in good standing for their respective terms.",
                "changed_text": "NTL shall use their discretion whether to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology.",
                "explanation": "Original text commits NTL to 'reasonable efforts' to maintain licenses. Modification replaces this with 'NTL shall use their discretion' to decide. This is a legal contradiction because the original text establishes a clear obligation, while the modified text makes it optional and not legally binding. This undermines the enforceability of the clause because it gives NTL absolute power of determination, rather than a duty subject to a reasonableness standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract; good faith.",

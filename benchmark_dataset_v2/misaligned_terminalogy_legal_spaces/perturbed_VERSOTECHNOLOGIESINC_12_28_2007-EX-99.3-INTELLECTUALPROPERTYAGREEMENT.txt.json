                "original_text": "Seller does hereby transfer, sell, assign, convey and deliver to Backhaul all right, title and interest in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the Trademarks and Patents set forth on Schedules A and B hereof, respectively, and all goodwill of the Purchased Business associated therewith.",
                "changed_text": "Seller does hereby transfer, sell, assign, convey and deliver to Backhaul all right, title and interest in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the Registered Trademarks and Active Patents mentioned on Schedules A and B hereof, respectively, and all goodwill of the Purchased Business associated therewith.",
                "explanation": "The modification restricts 'Trademarks' to 'Registered Trademarks' and 'Patents' to 'Active Patents'. This contradicts standard intellectual property law, which recognizes rights in unregistered trademarks and pending patent applications. The term 'Intellectual Property' generally includes more than just registered trademarks and active patents. Making the transfer conditional on these stricter terms could create ambiguity and disputes about the scope of the transferred assets.",

                "changed_text": "Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time forthwith upon the request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may be requested by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "By removing the word 'reasonable,' the modified clause now suggests that the Seller must comply with any request, regardless of how burdensome or unnecessary it may be. This creates a contradiction because standard contract law requires reasonableness in contractual obligations. Removing this qualifier introduces an element of potential overreach and renders the clause potentially unenforceable due to being overly broad and unfair.",

                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of whether the contract is to be performed within the State of Georgia.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified Georgia law because the contract was to be wholly performed within Georgia. The modified text specifies Delaware law, even if the contract is not performed there. This is a contradiction because it disconnects the choice of law from the place of performance, conflicting with general principles of contract law relating to choice of law provisions and potentially creating uncertainty about which state's laws actually govern the agreement, especially considering that the seller is a Delaware corporation, while the buyer is a Georgia corporation.",

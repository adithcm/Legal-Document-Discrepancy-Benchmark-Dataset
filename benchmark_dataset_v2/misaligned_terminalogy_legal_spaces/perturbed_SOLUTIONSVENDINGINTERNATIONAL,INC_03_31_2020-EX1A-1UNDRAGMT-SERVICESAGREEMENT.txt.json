            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A \"User\" means a natural person, corporation or other entity that has established an account on the Company's website.",
                "changed_text": "A \"User\" means a person or organization that expresses interest, whether or not they create an account on the Company's website.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"User\" required establishing an account. The modified definition broadens this to include anyone expressing interest, contradicting the initial requirement. This introduces ambiguity regarding who is subject to the agreement's terms, particularly concerning AML fees which are charged per User.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vague definition impacts KYC (Know Your Customer) / AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance, potentially violating regulations like the Bank Secrecy Act in the US.",
                "location": "Section 1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid for 30 days are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Service.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid are subject to a service fee as determined by the Company's discretion, plus expenses of collection and potential termination of Service.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear finance charge (1.5% per month or the legal maximum). The modified text replaces this with a discretionary \"service fee,\" removing the certainty of the fee structure. This creates ambiguity and could be viewed as usurious if the 'service fee' exceeds legal limits without clear justification or disclosure.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state usury laws and consumer protection laws requiring clear disclosure of interest rates and fees.",
                "location": "Section 2b"
            },
            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "User transactions debited from bank accounts via ACH are subject to returns (e.g., non-sufficient funds) and reversals from chargebacks (e.g., unauthorized activity) per the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. as may be amended), Regulation E, and NACHA guidelines (collectively, such returns and reversals are \"Reversals\"). The Company will work to protect Customer and the receiving Users from unwarranted Reversals; however, Customer acknowledges and agrees that: i) Customer is liable for all User Activity and Reversals associated with User Activity;",
                "changed_text": "User transactions debited from bank accounts are subject to potential disputes.  The Company will address potential disputes; however, Customer acknowledges and agrees that: i) Customer is generally liable for all activity related to these transactions;",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the explicit reference to ACH returns, chargebacks, and the legal framework governing them (EFTA, Regulation E, NACHA) with the vague term \"potential disputes.\"  It also softens the Customer's liability by changing \"all User Activity and Reversals associated with User Activity\" to \"all activity related to these transactions,\" and removes the direct connection to legally defined 'Reversals'. This weakens the legal enforceability and clarity of liability regarding electronic fund transfers.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates the spirit and potentially the letter of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and related regulations by obscuring the specific rights and responsibilities associated with electronic fund transfers.",

Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above­listed parties, the Holding Company may offer for sale in a direct community offering (the \"Community Offering\" and when referred to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the \"Subscription and Community Offering\") the Shares not subscribed for or ordered in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a preference given first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons residing in the local community as defined in the Plan, and thereafter to cover orders of other members of the general public. It is anticipated that Shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the \"Syndicated Community Offering\") or to certain members of the general public in a firm commitment underwritten offering (the \"Underwritten Offering\") with the Agent acting as sole book­running manager (the Underwritten Offering, Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the \"Offering\").",

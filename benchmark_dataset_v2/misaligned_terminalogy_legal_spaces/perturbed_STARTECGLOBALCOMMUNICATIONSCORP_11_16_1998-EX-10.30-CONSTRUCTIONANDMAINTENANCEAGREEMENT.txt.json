                "original_text": "AFFILIATE\n\n        A company in which not less than either ten percent (10%) or the highest         percentage  allowed by the local law,  whichever  is the lowest,  of its         voting  capital is owned  directly or indirectly by a Party or a company         owning  directly  or  indirectly  not less than  either ten (10%) or the         highest percentage allowed by the local law, whichever is the lowest, of         the voting capital of a Party.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is modified to create a contradiction. Initially, it specifies a minimum ownership percentage. The modification introduces ambiguity by not clearly stating a minimum percentage for indirect ownership, potentially conflicting with standard legal interpretations of affiliate relationships.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines Maintenance Authorities as Terminal Parties. The modified version gives the Managing Group the discretion to designate any party, potentially conflicting with the responsibilities and liabilities initially assigned to Terminal Parties. This can introduce confusion about who bears the legal responsibility for maintenance.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may,' the definition becomes discretionary. While seemingly minor, this removes the certainty of which laws apply to specific parties in the agreement, creating potential for legal disputes over jurisdiction and applicable regulations.",

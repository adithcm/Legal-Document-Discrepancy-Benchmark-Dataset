                "original_text": "Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf.",
                "changed_text": "Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make optional contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'consulting contract insurance' to 'optional contract insurance' creates ambiguity. The term 'consulting contract insurance' could be interpreted as professional liability insurance related to the consulting work, which is common for independent contractors. By making the insurance optional, the company may appear to be attempting to avoid obligations that might arise if the consultant is later deemed an employee. This introduces potential legal challenges to the independent contractor classification under employment laws.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all claims, damages, and liabilities, including all reasonable expenses and customary costs, legal or otherwise, caused by the negligent act or omission of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in the investigation and defense of any claim, demand, or action arising out of the work performed under this Agreement; including breach of the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'any and all expense and costs' to 'all reasonable expenses and customary costs' significantly alters the scope of indemnification. The original clause intends complete indemnification. By limiting it to 'reasonable expenses and customary costs', the clause introduces ambiguity and a basis for dispute. In some jurisdictions, the standard for indemnification requires covering all actual losses and expenses arising from the indemnified event. The term 'customary' adds further uncertainty, as what is customary may be subject to interpretation and litigation. This change undermines the full protection that indemnification aims to provide.",

                "original_text": "If a dispute arises out of or relates to this contract, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or some other dispute resolution procedure.",
                "changed_text": "If a disagreement arises relating to this contract, or the violation thereof, and if the disagreement cannot be resolved through informal discussion, the parties agree first to attempt resolution via non-binding mediation. The choice of mediator, location, and format shall be determined solely by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Mediation Procedures. The modified clause replaces this with a vague requirement for 'non-binding mediation' with the Company unilaterally controlling mediator selection, location, and format. This contradicts the standard practice of neutral mediation facilitated by an impartial body like the AAA, potentially undermining the fairness and effectiveness of the mediation process.",

                "changed_text": "All \"Revenue\" calculations shall refer to gross revenue actually received by the collecting party with deductions for client debits but without any deduction or offset for costs incurred by either Party, except for \"Direct Deals\".",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'credits and allowances for returns' with 'deductions for client debits'. \"Credits and allowances for returns\" has a specific meaning referring to reductions in sales price for defective or returned goods. Changing this to 'deductions for client debits' introduces ambiguity, as 'debits' is a general accounting term and does not clearly specify what types of deductions are permissible. This creates a contradiction because standard accounting practices require clarity on what constitutes revenue adjustments, and this change obscures that clarity.",

Kubient shall have a limited right to or interest in \"Revenue\" generated from Direct Deals with Regions Bank, Undertone, or Healthgrades.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall refer to any sort of\" to \"may refer to some types of\" and \"shall have no right to\" to \"shall have a limited right to\", the definition of 'Direct Deals' and Kubient's rights are made ambiguous. The original text explicitly excludes Kubient from revenue generated by specific Direct Deals. The modified text implies that under certain undefined circumstances, Kubient might have some entitlement. This contradicts the initial clear exclusion, leading to potential disputes over revenue sharing. It uses language that is vague, making the contract open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'is generated' to 'is partly generated' and 'shall have no right' to 'may have an indirect right' introduces a contradiction by creating uncertainty around Kubient's rights to \"Native\" ad revenue. The original text definitively excludes Kubient, while the modified text suggests a possible, undefined entitlement. This vagueness undermines the contract's clarity and creates a legal contradiction.",

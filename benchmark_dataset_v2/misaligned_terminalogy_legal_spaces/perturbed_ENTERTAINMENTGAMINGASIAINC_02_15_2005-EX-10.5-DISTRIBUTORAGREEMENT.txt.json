                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Vendor is the owner of patents, patents pending, trademarks, and other related intellectual property involving a full range of shuffling machine products for the casino industry (collectively, the \"Products\" and, individually, the \"Product\");",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Vendor is the owner of patents, patents pending, trademarks, and other related physical items involving a limited range of shuffling machine products for the casino industry (collectively, the \"Products\" and, individually, the \"Product\");",
                "explanation": "The term 'intellectual property' has a precise legal definition, encompassing patents and trademarks. By replacing it with 'physical items', the contract introduces ambiguity as to what is actually owned and protected. Also, the term 'full range' was changed to 'limited range' which creates legal uncertainty regarding the scope of Vendor's products.",

As part of the exclusive distribution right granted in this Section 2, Vendor hereby grants Distributor the non- exclusive, non-transferable right to use and display Vendor's trademarks, logos, Product photographs and images, Product advertising and promotional copy, including but not limited to the materials contained in Vendor's website, in connection with the promotion, advertising and distribution of the Products.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration for the purchase of the Products by Distributor from Vendor, Vendor grants Distributor a non-exclusive license to casually mention, occasionally offer, possibly fix the Products and maybe suggest improvements on them within the Territory (as defined herein) according to the terms and conditions as set forth herein. As part of the vague distribution understanding granted in this Section 2, Vendor hereby grants Distributor the non- exclusive, non-transferable right to use and display Vendor's trademarks, logos, Product photographs and images, Product advertising and promotional copy, including but not limited to the materials contained in Vendor's website, in connection with the promotion, advertising and distribution of the Products.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants an 'exclusive right' to market, sell, rent, lease, service, and maintain the Products. The changed text replaces this with a 'non-exclusive license' to 'casually mention, occasionally offer, possibly fix the Products and maybe suggest improvements on them', severely weakening Distributor's rights and creating a contradiction within the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that Vendor 'warrants' the Products, a statement that creates a legal obligation on Vendor. The modified version states that vendor 'vaguely hopes' their products 'might' perform which is a non-committal statement that significantly reduces Vendor's responsibility. Also the 'Distributor, in cooperation with vendor' was replaced with 'Distributor, independently from vendor' which goes against the original warranty.",

                "original_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\").

                "changed_text": "This Amendment No. 3 (the \"Third Amendment\"), entered into by and between Stremicks Heritage Foods, LLC (\"Heritage\") Premier Nutrition Corporation (\"Premier\") is effective as of July 3, 2019 (\"Third Amendment Effective Date\") and amends that certain Manufacturing Agreement between Heritage and Premier dated July 1, 2017 as amended (\"Agreement\"). Heritage and Premier are each referred to herein as a \"Contractor\" and collectively as the \"Contractors.\"",
                "explanation": "Changing \"Party\" to \"Contractor\" introduces ambiguity. While generally understood, 'Party' has a clear legal definition in contract law referring to those directly involved in the agreement. 'Contractor', especially when pluralized, can imply independent contractors or other business relationships, potentially blurring the lines of responsibility and liability established in the original agreement. This misaligned terminology could lead to disputes about the nature of the relationship between Heritage and Premier.",

                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Heritage and Premier commenced an understanding;",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Agreement' with 'understanding' diminishes the legal enforceability and clarity of the contract. \"Agreement\" has a concrete legal weight, signifying a binding contract with defined obligations. \"Understanding\" is a more informal term, suggesting a less binding arrangement. This shift undermines the foundation of contract law, potentially rendering the terms less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the binding nature of the amendment. By replacing 'consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants, representations and warranties' with 'casual consideration of the suggestions and informal arrangements, representations and vague assurances', the amendment suggests a non-binding and optional agreement. Replacing \"Parties hereby agree\" with \"Contractors consider that future changes are optional to the understanding\" further diminishes the contractual obligation, contradicting fundamental principles of contract law regarding mutual assent and consideration.",

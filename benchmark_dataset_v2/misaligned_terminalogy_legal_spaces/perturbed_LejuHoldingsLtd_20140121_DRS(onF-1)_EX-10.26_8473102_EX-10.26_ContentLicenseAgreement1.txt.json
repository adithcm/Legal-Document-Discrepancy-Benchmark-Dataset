For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession, directly or indirectly or as trustee, personal representative or executor, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, as trustee, personal representative or executor, by contract, credit arrangement or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, when used with respect to any specified Person, a Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, has a business association with such specified Person. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means having a non-binding advisory role.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" aligns with standard legal interpretations regarding control through ownership or management influence. The modified definition replaces 'controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with' with 'has a business association with', significantly weakening the link. Additionally, redefining 'control' as 'having a non-binding advisory role' directly contradicts established legal and business norms, where control implies decision-making power. This change introduces ambiguity and could allow parties to circumvent obligations related to affiliated entities by claiming a lack of actual control.",

Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event that the Licensee is in material default or breach of any provision of this Agreement, and, if such default or breach is capable of cure, such default or breach continues uncured for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof; provided, however, that in the event that the Licensee has in good faith commenced cure within such thirty (30) day period, but cannot practically complete such cure within such thirty (30) day period, the Parties shall negotiate a reasonable additional time to cure.",
                "changed_text": "6.3. Termination for Breach.\n\n(a) By Licensor. Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event that the Licensee is in default or breach of any provision of this Agreement, regardless of the significance of the breach or its ability to be cured. No notice will be required prior to the termination.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies 'material default or breach' and allows a cure period. The modified version removes the 'material' qualifier, allowing termination for any breach, however minor. It also eliminates the cure period, and now requires that 'No notice will be required prior to the termination'. This directly contradicts standard contract law principles which usually require notice and an opportunity to cure for breaches, especially material ones. By allowing immediate termination for any breach, the modified clause creates a legally dubious and potentially unenforceable provision.",

The claiming Party (the \"Claimant\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Respondent\") in a dated written notice that a Dispute has arisen and describe the nature of the Dispute. Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"Commission\") to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission's then effective rules (the \"Rules\") and this Section 10.12.

The Licensor's decision shall be final and not subject to any form of appeal or external review. The Licensor is not obligated to provide any explanation or justification for its decision.",
                "explanation": "The original dispute resolution clause mandates arbitration through the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission. The modified clause replaces this with a unilateral decision-making power granted to the Licensor. This completely negates the principle of impartial dispute resolution and directly contradicts the purpose of arbitration clauses, which are designed to provide a neutral forum for resolving disagreements. Such a clause is highly unlikely to be upheld in many jurisdictions as it lacks fundamental fairness and due process.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that (a) was or has become  publicly available without restriction through no fault of the receiving Party or its employees or agents; (b) is received without restriction from a  third party that, to the best knowledge of the receiving Party, did not have an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (c) was  rightfully in possession of the receiving Party without restriction prior to its disclosure by the other Party; or (d) was independently developed by  employees of the receiving Party that had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by written records of the receiving Party.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the key qualifiers regarding the exceptions to Confidential Information. Removing \"through no fault of the receiving Party or its employees or agents\" from (a), \"without restriction from a third party that, to the best knowledge of the receiving Party, did not have an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party\" from (b), \"rightfully in possession of the receiving Party without restriction\" from (c), and \"independently developed by employees of the receiving Party that had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by written records of the receiving Party.\" from (d) broadens the exceptions, making the definition of Confidential Information so vague as to be practically unenforceable.",

The Day Rate for each type of service  provided will be as per the rate card set out in Exhibit C, such rates to be subject to annual review by the Parties on the anniversary of this  Agreement provided that such rates may be reviewed on an ad hoc basis at any time should the Parties become aware of specific information  which impacts on the validity or feasibility of the Day Rate.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 Day Rate shall mean the suggested rate at which Rubicon will provide services to ISA or ISA Clients. The Day Rate for each type of service  provided will be generally similar to the rate card set out in Exhibit C, such rates being subject to review by Rubicon at any time based on market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Day Rate\" is made ambiguous by changing \"daily rate\" to \"suggested rate\", removing the commitment to Exhibit C, and giving Rubicon unilateral power to adjust rates based on undefined \"market conditions\". This contradicts the original intent of a fixed day rate, creating uncertainty in payment obligations and disputes over pricing.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law requires clear pricing terms; this modification makes the pricing term vague and unilaterally adjustable, potentially unenforceable.",

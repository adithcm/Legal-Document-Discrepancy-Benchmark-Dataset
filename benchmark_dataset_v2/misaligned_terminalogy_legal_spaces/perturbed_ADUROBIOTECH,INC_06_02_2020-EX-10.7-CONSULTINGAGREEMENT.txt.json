                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor. Consultant shall be responsible for the timely payment of his or her own self-employment and income taxes. Neither party shall have any authority to bind the other.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor. Aduro shall manage all tax withholdings for the consultant. Aduro shall have complete authority to direct and control the consultant's work schedule and methods.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor' under both California and US federal law. By assuming responsibility for tax withholdings and asserting control over the consultant's work, the relationship is effectively reclassified as employer-employee, despite the contract's explicit designation. This misclassification can have significant legal and financial consequences for both parties.",

                "original_text": "(a) \"Confidential Information\" means any information, materials or methods in whatever form or embodiment that has not been made available by Aduro to the general public and any information, materials or methods in the possession or control of Consultant on the Effective Date or developed in the performance of the Services, except that Confidential Information shall not include any information, material or method that (i) at the time of disclosure is in, or after disclosure becomes part of the public domain, through no improper act on the part of Consultant or any of its employees; (ii) was in Consultant's possession at the time of disclosure, as shown by written evidence, and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from work with Aduro; or (iii) Consultant receives from a third party, provided that such Confidential Information was not obtained by such third party, directly or indirectly, from Aduro.",
                "changed_text": "(a) \"Confidential Information\" means only that information explicitly marked as 'Confidential' by Aduro. Information not marked as 'Confidential' shall not be considered such, regardless of its nature or sensitivity. Confidential Information shall not include any information, material or method that (i) at the time of disclosure is in, or after disclosure becomes part of the public domain, through no improper act on the part of Consultant or any of its employees; (ii) was in Consultant's possession at the time of disclosure, as shown by written evidence, and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from work with Aduro; or (iii) Consultant receives from a third party, provided that such Confidential Information was not obtained by such third party, directly or indirectly, from Aduro.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by requiring explicit marking for information to be considered confidential. Under established trade secret and confidentiality law, information can be considered confidential based on its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure, regardless of whether it is explicitly marked. Requiring explicit marking contradicts the common law principle that confidential information retains its status based on context and inherent secrecy. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes confidential information and may render the confidentiality clause unenforceable for unmarked yet sensitive data.",

                "original_text": "6. Intellectual Property. Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\").",
                "changed_text": "6. Intellectual Property. Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of Work Product only if such Work Product is patentable. Consultant retains ownership of all non-patentable Work Product. Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\").",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction within the intellectual property clause. The first sentence states that ownership of work product depends on patentability, which conflicts with the subsequent sentence that broadly assigns all work product to Aduro, regardless of patentability. This introduces ambiguity regarding the ownership of non-patentable materials like know-how or research data, potentially leading to disputes. This also conflicts with the principle that copyright and trade secret rights can exist independently of patent rights.",

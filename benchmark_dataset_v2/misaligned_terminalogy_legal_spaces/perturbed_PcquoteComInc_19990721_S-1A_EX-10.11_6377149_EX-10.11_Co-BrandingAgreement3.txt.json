                "explanation": "Changing 'Amendment' to 'Suggestion' creates a contradiction. An 'Amendment' legally binds parties to modified terms. 'Suggestion' implies non-binding advice, undermining the contract's enforceability. This creates ambiguity about whether the changes are legally required.",

This fundamentally undermines the purpose of the amendment to alter the original agreement, and creates a clear contradiction.",

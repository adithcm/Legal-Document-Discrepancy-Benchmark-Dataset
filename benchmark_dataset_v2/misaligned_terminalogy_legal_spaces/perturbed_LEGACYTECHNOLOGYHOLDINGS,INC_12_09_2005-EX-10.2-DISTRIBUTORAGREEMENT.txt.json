                "changed_text": "The Territory shall be limited to North America.",
                "explanation": "The original contract defines the territory as 'the entire world.' The modified version restricts it to 'North America.' This introduces a contradiction as a distributor agreement cannot be changed like that. This change directly impacts the scope of exclusivity granted to ENVISION and could render the contract unenforceable in regions outside North America, as it contradicts the initial agreement of worldwide distribution rights.",

                "changed_text": "SIERRA makes no guarantees about the Product being adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear warranty that the product complies with adulteration and misbranding laws. The changed text removes this warranty, effectively stating that the product may or may not comply. This is a contradiction because such a warranty is standard in distribution agreements related to consumables and its removal creates uncertainty about legal compliance, potentially violating consumer protection laws if the products are indeed adulterated or misbranded.",

                "changed_text": "The parties acknowledge that ENVISION is an independent contractor but may be considered an agent of SIERRA for marketing purposes only.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly defines ENVISION as an independent contractor, precluding any employer-employee or agency relationship. The changed text introduces an agency relationship for marketing purposes. This is a contradiction because an independent contractor cannot simultaneously be an agent under common law. This misclassification can have significant legal implications for tax liabilities, vicarious liability, and the applicability of labor laws.",

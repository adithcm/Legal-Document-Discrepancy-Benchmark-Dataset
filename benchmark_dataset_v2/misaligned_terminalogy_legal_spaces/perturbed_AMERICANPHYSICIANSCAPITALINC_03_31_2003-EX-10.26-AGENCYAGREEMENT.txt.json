            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Agency is an independent insurance Agency and independent contractor, and not an employee, manager, officer or owner of MICOA.",
                "changed_text": "The Agency is designated as an independent entity for operational purposes; however, MICOA retains the right to direct the Agency's actions and strategies.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor' under Nevada and federal law, which emphasizes autonomy and control. By asserting the right to direct the Agency's actions, MICOA blurs the line between independent contractor and employee, potentially leading to misclassification and liability issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS guidelines for independent contractor status; Nevada Revised Statutes regarding independent contractors (e.g., NRS 608.015).",
                "location": "Section I.4"
            },
            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date.",
                "changed_text": "If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA may, at its sole discretion, compensate Agency for the client list derived from the business under this agreement. This discretionary compensation, if provided, shall be at a rate determined by MICOA based on the perceived value of the client relationships, but it will be determined solely by MICOA.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly outlines a mandatory purchase of expirations at a defined price. The modified text makes any compensation for the client list completely discretionary and removes any obligation for MICOA to pay a set amount. Expirations have established value, and this deviation creates uncertainty and contradicts insurance industry standards and potentially relevant case law regarding ownership of expirations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law regarding ownership of insurance expirations; potential violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Nevada contract law.",
                "location": "Section D.1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of Nevada. Any provisions of this Agreement or any amendments to the Agreement that are or become in conflict with any applicable statutes or regulations shall be deemed to be amended to conform to those statutes or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted according to the subjective intent of MICOA's management at the time of enforcement. To the extent any provision conflicts with Nevada law, MICOA reserves the right to enforce the provision as written, regardless of its legality under Nevada statutes.",
                "explanation": "This clause initially states that Nevada law governs and conflicts will be resolved in favor of legal compliance. The altered text subverts this by prioritizing MICOA's subjective intent and explicitly claiming the right to disregard conflicting Nevada statutes. This creates a direct legal contradiction, undermining the enforceability of the entire agreement under Nevada law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic principles of contract law regarding choice of law and enforceability; Nevada Revised Statutes requiring compliance with state law.",
                "location": "Section I.5"

                "original_text": "1.1. WLI hereby grants to Power2Ship the non-exclusive right and license to distribute certain WLI's products and services (the \"Products\" or \"Units\") and software programs (\"Licensed Programs\") to Power2Ship's customers (which are end users) located in North America. \"Products\" or \"Units\" in this Agreement are limited to WLI's G3001 GPSLink mobile terminal as defined in Section 1.2. \"Licensed Programs\" in this Agreement are limited to WLI's MidLink Middleware software and G3001 programming tools. Further, Power2Ship shall also be authorized to resell other WLI products, services and support programs subject to separate written amendments to be made by the parties to this Agreement. WLI reserves the right to add additional products and to delete obsolete or superseded products at any time during the term of this Agreement upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Power2Ship.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that customers are end users, providing a clear limitation. By changing 'end users' to 'anyone,' the modification broadens the scope of permissible customers, potentially conflicting with distribution restrictions or export control laws that might apply specifically to 'end users.' This introduces uncertainty about who Power2Ship can legally sell to under the agreement.",

                "original_text": "11.1. WLI warrants the Products pursuant to the terms of its hardware limited warranty and limited software warranty set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Subject to the terms and conditions of Exhibit A, WLI agrees, in its sole discretion, to repair or replace at its sole cost and expense, any defective Products or parts thereof which are returned to it within the applicable warranty period, provided that the Products have not been altered or repaired other than with authorization from WLI and by its approved procedures; that the Products have not been subjected to misuse, improper maintenance, negligence or accident; that the Products have not been damaged by excessive physical or electrical stress; and that the Products have not had their serial number or any part thereof altered, defaced or removed.",
                "changed_text": "11.1. WLI warrants the Products pursuant to the terms of its hardware limited warranty and general software guarantee as understood in the state of New Jersey. Subject to the general practices of Wireless Links Inc, WLI agrees, in its sole discretion, to attempt a remedy for defective Products or parts thereof which are returned to it, provided that the Products have not been altered or repaired; that the Products have not been misused, or improperly maintained; and that the Products have not been damaged by physical or electrical circumstances; and that the Products have not had their serial number altered, defaced or removed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'limited warranty' with 'general software guarantee as understood in the state of New Jersey' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what constitutes a 'general software guarantee' and how it differs from the express terms in Exhibit B, which are removed from direct reference. This contradicts standard warranty definitions, as general practices are not clearly defined and can change without notice, making the warranty unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2 on Sales, which requires clear and conspicuous warranty terms.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from the 'laws of the State of New Jersey' to 'general principles of justice' creates a conflict. Contract law relies on established legal frameworks like New Jersey state laws. 'General principles of justice' are subjective and lack specific legal precedent, making it difficult to predict how a court would interpret and enforce the contract.",

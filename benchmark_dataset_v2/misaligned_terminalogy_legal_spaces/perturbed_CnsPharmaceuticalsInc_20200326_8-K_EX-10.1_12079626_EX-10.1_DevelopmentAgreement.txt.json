                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.6 \"Development Products\" means: (i) Sublicensed Products, as defined in the Sublicense Agreement, in the field of pharmaceutical drug products for the treatment of any viral infection in humans; and (ii) any other drug or product in the field of pharmaceutical drug products for the treatment of any viral infection in humans that is licensed between WPD and MBI after this date.",
                "changed_text": "1.6 \"Development Products\" means: (i) Sublicensed Products, as defined in the Sublicense Agreement, in the field of pharmaceutical drug products; and (ii) any other product licensed between WPD and MBI after this date.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Development Products' was broadened by removing the limitation to 'the treatment of any viral infection in humans'. This creates a contradiction because the agreement initially focused on antiviral treatments but now includes any pharmaceutical drug product, potentially conflicting with the stated purpose and financial arrangements tied to antiviral development.",

                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Development Fee\" means a percentage of the Net Sales for any Development Products in the Development Territory as determined by WPD's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing the Development Fee from a fixed 50% to a percentage determined at WPD's discretion introduces significant ambiguity and potential conflict. It contradicts the initial agreement's clear financial terms, making it harder to enforce and potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WPD hereby agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable or advisable under applicable laws to develop and commercialize the Development Products, with a goal of eventual approval of Development Products in the Development Territory.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WPD hereby agrees to attempt, as it deems fit, actions to develop and commercialize the Development Products, with a goal of eventual approval of Development Products in the Development Territory.",
                "explanation": "The term 'commercially reasonable efforts in good faith' has a defined legal interpretation. By replacing it with 'attempt, as it deems fit,' the obligation becomes vague and discretionary, thus contradicting the legally understood duty of commercially reasonable efforts and potentially making the agreement unenforceable due to lack of clear commitment.",

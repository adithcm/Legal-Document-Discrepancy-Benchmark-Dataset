Nothing in this Development Agreement is to be construed to deem the relationship between the parties to be one  of master/servant, principal/agent, or employer/employee. To the contrary, the relationship of Cargill to Bioamber is that of independent  contractor, and Cargill will have no authority to (i) make any binding decision for, or on behalf of, Bioamber or (ii) commit Bioamber to any  contract, obligation, debt, or other liability. None of Cargill's employees will be deemed to be employees of Bioamber.",

Nothing in this Development Agreement is to be construed to deem the relationship between the parties to be one  of master/servant, principal/agent, or employer/employee. To the contrary, the relationship of Cargill to Bioamber is that of independent  contractor, and Cargill will have full authority to (i) make any binding decision for, or on behalf of, Bioamber or (ii) commit Bioamber to any  contract, obligation, debt, or other liability. Cargill's employees will be deemed to be employees of Bioamber.",
                "explanation": "By granting Cargill, the 'independent contractor,' full authority to make binding decisions and commit Bioamber to liabilities, the modified text directly contradicts the established legal definition of an independent contractor, which typically lacks such authority. This creates ambiguity and could lead to disputes over liability and control, as well as potential misclassification under labor laws.",

For purposes of clarity, the parties shall not disclose to  each other any Confidential Information that is not material to the Work Plan, such as, by way of example and without limitation, processes  and other information relating to post-fermentation activities. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (a) is in the public  domain prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party; (b) becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no  unauthorized act or omission by the Receiving Party; (c) is lawfully in the Receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure by the  Disclosing Party; or (d) is independently developed by an employee(s) of the Receiving Party with no access to the disclosed Confidential  Information.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is tied to the Work Plan and excludes certain publicly available or independently developed information. The modified definition broadens this scope to include all business, technical, and financial information regardless of materiality to the Work Plan. Moreover, it reverses the exclusion to now include information already in the public domain. This creates a contradiction as publicly known information cannot legally be protected as confidential, and it makes the scope of 'Confidential Information' excessively broad and likely unenforceable.",

For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to  fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such  Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Bioamber Improvement and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a  Cargill Improvement.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Improvements' within the context of the Work Plan and assigns ownership based on the field of application, differentiating between Bioamber and Cargill Improvements. The modified text eliminates the connection to the Work Plan, broadens the definition to include any creation, and assigns all ownership of Improvements to Bioamber, regardless of the field. This directly contradicts the initial intent of shared ownership and creates an imbalance that could be challenged as unconscionable or a failure of consideration, particularly since Cargill contributed the original CB1 strain.",

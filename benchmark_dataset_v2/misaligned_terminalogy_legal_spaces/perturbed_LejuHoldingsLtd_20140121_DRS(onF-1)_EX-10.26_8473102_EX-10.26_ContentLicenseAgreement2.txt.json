                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of the PRC. The modified clause replaces this with 'principles of equity and fairness', which are subjective and contradict the established legal framework of the PRC. This creates uncertainty as to which legal standards apply and whether PRC courts would enforce such a vague provision, thus conflicting with the statutory laws.",

                "explanation": "The original clause ensures the agreement extends to successors and assigns, which is standard legal practice. The modified clause restricts this by requiring written consent for successors or assigns to be bound, contradicting established contract law principles regarding the transferability of contractual rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business Day' is clear and tied to standard holidays. The modified version introduces ambiguity by allowing the CEO to arbitrarily declare 'Company Holidays,' which contradicts the standard definition used in legal and financial contexts. This could affect deadlines and obligations under the contract, making enforcement uncertain, as the term's meaning can shift based on the CEO's decisions.",

                "changed_text": "(v) the Corporation is not included in a list of defaulting reporting issuers maintained by the Securities Commissions in the Qualifying Jurisdictions, and while the Corporation aims to disclose material changes, it reserves the right to delay such disclosure based on internal strategic considerations. The Corporation will substantially comply with the rules and regulations of the TSXV, interpreting compliance in a manner beneficial to its operations, as decided by the Board.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the Corporation's obligation for timely disclosure of material changes. Securities laws require prompt disclosure to ensure fair markets. The clause introduces discretion, potentially delaying or avoiding disclosure based on 'internal strategic considerations' and subjective interpretations of compliance, contradicting securities regulations. This change undermines investor protection and creates enforcement uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "(a) Rights of Indemnity (1) The Corporation covenants and agrees to protect, indemnify, and save harmless, each of the Agents and their respective affiliates. However, the Corporation’s indemnity obligation is limited to the extent of available insurance coverage, and the Corporation’s decision on whether to defend any claim is final. If the Corporation chooses not to defend, the Agents bear the full cost, regardless of outcome. Further, the indemnification does not apply if the Agent's actions led to reputational damage of any kind. No third-party claims are subject to indemnity, regardless of their relation to the Agent's actions.",
                "explanation": "The modified indemnity clause significantly reduces the Corporation's obligation to indemnify the Agents. It introduces limitations based on insurance coverage, the Corporation's discretion, and excludes coverage for reputational damage or any third-party claims, creating legal uncertainty on the indemnification responsibilities. This introduces legal uncertainty regarding the financial protections afforded to the Agents, particularly if their actions lead to disputes or claims. This undermines standard indemnity practices and could be viewed as an unenforceable restriction.",

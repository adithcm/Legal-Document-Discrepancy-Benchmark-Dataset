                "original_text": "Grantor hereby grants to Grantee and Grantee hereby accepts a franchise to construct, reconstruct, operate, maintain, repair, and extend a Gas Distribution System within Grantor's Territorial Limits in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below (\"Franchise\"). The Franchise is granted pursuant to Grantor's Franchise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 967), adopted November 17, 2015, (\"Ordinance\"), which is incorporated by reference herein, including any applicable definitions.",
                "changed_text": "Grantor hereby grants to Grantee and Grantee hereby accepts a franchise to construct, reconstruct, operate, maintain, repair, and extend a Gas Distribution System within Grantor's Territorial Limits in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below (\"Agreement\"). The Franchise is granted pursuant to Grantor's Franchise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 967), adopted November 17, 2015, (\"Ordinance\"), which is incorporated by reference herein, including any applicable definitions.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Franchise\" is replaced with \"Agreement\" in the first sentence. While the document is an agreement, changing the defined term creates confusion. It is no longer clear if the granted rights pertain to the 'Franchise' or just the overall 'Agreement', especially given the subsequent reference to the 'Franchise' being granted pursuant to the Ordinance. This misaligns with standard legal definitions of a franchise within Virginia.",

                "original_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Agreement maintain at least one point of contact within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such point of contact shall be available during reasonable business hours for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"business office\" with \"point of contact\" and \"forty (40) hours per week\" with \"reasonable business hours\" introduces ambiguity. 'Business office' has a generally understood meaning, while 'point of contact' is vague. 'Forty hours per week' is a definite standard. 'Reasonable business hours' is subjective. This contradicts the specificity normally expected in franchise agreements concerning accessibility and customer service.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'notices required' to 'all communications' broadens the scope vaguely. Replacing 'certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a nationally recognized overnight courier' with 'standard mail or electronic mail' reduces the reliability and verifiability of delivery. Also, 'designated to the sender by like notice' was replaced with 'indicated to the sender', adding more ambiguity. This contradicts standard legal practices requiring reliable notification methods, particularly in legal agreements where proof of delivery is crucial.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") will begin on February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement, effective at any time after the first three months of the Term, by giving 30 days' written notice of termination to the other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") will begin on February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement, effective at any time after the first three months of the Term, by giving 30 days' verbal notice of termination to the other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving verbal notice of termination to the other party, if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "This change conflicts with standard contract law requirements that material notices, such as termination notices, be written to ensure clarity and verifiability. Verbal notice introduces ambiguity and could be challenged in court, thus creating a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a) standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!

                "explanation": "By omitting \"with the exception of CNET Direct, which operates BuyDirect.com\" from the definition and changing \"Competing Computer Products Retailer\" to \"retailer\" in the second sentence, the modified clause now has the potential to create a conflict of interest or be considered an anti-competitive agreement. This is because CNET Direct (BuyDirect.com) is now included in the group of businesses from which CNET is limited in accepting agreements. The modification can now be interpreted as a restriction on CNET working with its own subsidiaries.",

                "explanation": "By adding the phrase \"even if CNET is at fault,\" the indemnification clause now extends to situations where CNET's own negligence or misconduct contributed to the losses. This modification is a contradiction because standard indemnification clauses typically do not cover the indemnitee's (CNET's) own fault unless explicitly and conspicuously stated and often require specific language regarding gross negligence or willful misconduct, which is absent here. This conflicts with common law principles governing indemnity and potentially violates public policy in some jurisdictions by shifting responsibility for one's own actions.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate's Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" sometimes means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate's Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) may or may not be reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"is reported\" to \"may or may not be reported\" introduces ambiguity. According to the contract the term 'Approved Account' has no singular definition, thus making it undefinable. This contradicts the clear definition required for contract enforcement, impacting payment obligations and compliance under contract law, as the basis for commission calculation becomes uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "Affiliate will continue to receive payments, potentially including Commission, for all applications originating during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate demonstrates sufficient compliance with what Chase deems to be the relevant terms and conditions.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Commission payments for all Approved Accounts' with 'payments, potentially including Commission, for all applications originating' introduces a contradiction about what constitutes a payable event. Changing 'does not comply' to 'demonstrates sufficient compliance' creates further ambiguity regarding termination conditions, directly conflicting with standard contract law requiring clear performance standards and obligations.",

Chase shall be responsible for administering application forms and related customer service.",
                "changed_text": "Customers are encouraged, but not required, to use the Chase on-line application process to apply for a Chase credit card. The term 'Customers' may refer to individuals who apply for Chase credit cards through any channel. Chase may, at its discretion, administer application forms and customer service.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'may only use' to 'are encouraged, but not required' directly contradicts the initially stated requirement for online applications. Defining 'Customers' as 'may refer to individuals who apply through any channel' broadens the scope beyond the Affiliate's Website link, which is central to the Affiliate Program. Additionally, Changing \"shall be responsible\" to \"may, at its discretion\" introduces ambiguity around customer service responsibilities. These changes create legal uncertainty regarding the scope and obligations under the contract.",

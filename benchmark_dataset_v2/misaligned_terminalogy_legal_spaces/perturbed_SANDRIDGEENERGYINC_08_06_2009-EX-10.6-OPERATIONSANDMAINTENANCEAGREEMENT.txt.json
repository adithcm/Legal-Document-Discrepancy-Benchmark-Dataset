                "original_text": "The Parties expressly understand and agree that Operator is acting and shall perform and execute the provisions of this Agreement as an independent contractor unrelated to Owner or any Owner Affiliate, and the work performed by Operator hereunder shall be subject to Owner's general right of inspection and approval. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a relationship, expressed or implied, of employer- employee or principal-agent between Owner and Operator or between Owner and any individual employed or provided to work hereunder by Operator.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties expressly understand and agree that Operator is acting and shall perform and execute the provisions of this Agreement as a worker related to Owner or any Owner Affiliate, and the work performed by Operator hereunder shall be subject to Owner's general right of direction and control. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a relationship, expressed or implied, of employer- employee or principal-agent between Owner and Operator or between Owner and any individual employed or provided to work hereunder by Operator.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' and explicitly stating 'related to Owner' contradicts the legal definition of an independent contractor. Adding 'right of direction and control' further implies an employer-employee relationship, conflicting with the stated intent of the agreement. This creates uncertainty about the Operator's status under labor laws.",

                "original_text": "Force Majeure means any cause or causes not reasonably within the control of the Party claiming suspension and which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or overcome, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts, omissions to act, and/or delays in action of federal, state, or local government or any agency thereof, strikes, lockouts, work stoppages, or other industrial disturbances, acts of a public enemy, sabotage, wars, blockades, insurrections, riots, acts of terror, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms, storm warnings, floods, washouts, extreme cold or freezing weather, arrests and restraints of governments and people, civil or criminal disturbances, interruptions by governmental or court orders, present and future valid orders of any regulatory body having jurisdiction, explosions, mechanical failures, breakage, or accident to equipment installations, machinery, compressors, or lines of pipe, and associated repairs, freezing of wells or lines of pipe, partial or entire failure of wells, pipes, facilities, or equipment, electric power unavailability or shortages, failure of pipelines or carriers to transport, partial or entire failure or refusal of operators of upstream or downstream pipelines or facilities to receive gas, governmental regulations, and inability to obtain or timely obtain, or obtain at a reasonable cost, after exercise of reasonable diligence, pipe, materials, equipment, rights-of- way, servitudes, governmental approvals, or labor, including those necessary for the facilities provided for in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Force Majeure means any cause or causes within the control of the Party claiming suspension and which, even without the exercise of reasonable diligence, such Party is automatically entitled to prevent or overcome, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts, omissions to act, and/or delays in action of federal, state, or local government or any agency thereof, strikes, lockouts, work stoppages, or other industrial disturbances, acts of a public enemy, sabotage, wars, blockades, insurrections, riots, acts of terror, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms, storm warnings, floods, washouts, extreme cold or freezing weather, arrests and restraints of governments and people, civil or criminal disturbances, interruptions by governmental or court orders, present and future valid orders of any regulatory body having jurisdiction, explosions, mechanical failures, breakage, or accident to equipment installations, machinery, compressors, or lines of pipe, and associated repairs, freezing of wells or lines of pipe, partial or entire failure of wells, pipes, facilities, or equipment, electric power unavailability or shortages, failure of pipelines or carriers to transport, partial or entire failure or refusal of operators of upstream or downstream pipelines or facilities to receive gas, governmental regulations, and inability to obtain or timely obtain, or obtain at a reasonable cost, after exercise of reasonable diligence, pipe, materials, equipment, rights-of- way, servitudes, governmental approvals, or labor, including those necessary for the facilities provided for in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'not reasonably within the control' to 'within the control' directly contradicts the standard definition of Force Majeure. Removing the 'reasonable diligence' requirement further weakens the clause and creates legal uncertainty. This could lead to disputes over whether an event truly qualifies as Force Majeure, especially concerning events the party could have mitigated.",

                "explanation": "Removing standard of care and due diligence phrases like “good and workmanlike manner,” “conformity with good practices,” “in accordance with applicable laws” creates a massive hole in the obligations of the operator. This essentially creates an unenforceable set of duties because no standard applies. The operator essentially can get away with a lot under this type of circumstance.",

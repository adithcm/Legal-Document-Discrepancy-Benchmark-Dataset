                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of Taiwan. The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney's fees).",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted according to the general principles of contract law. The Parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute informally. If informal efforts fail, either Party may issue a \"Concern Notice,\" outlining the nature of the disagreement. Should the Parties fail to reach a consensus within sixty (60) days of the Concern Notice, either Party may escalate the dispute to mediation or other resolution methods, at their discretion. In any formal proceeding, each Party will present their case according to procedures they deem appropriate. The proceedings will be conducted in English. The Parties may disclose details of the dispute as they see fit. The outcome of any resolution will be considered advisory. Each Party will be responsible for its own costs.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces standard legal terms with vague, non-specific language. 'Governed by the laws of Taiwan' is replaced with 'general principles of contract law,' which is overly broad and doesn't specify a legal system. 'Dispute Notice' becomes 'Concern Notice,' reducing its legal weight. Mandatory arbitration is replaced with discretionary mediation, and the finality of the arbitration award is removed, making any resolution advisory only. The language of the proceedings is also switched to English, which introduces potential conflict given the parties' locations and agreement to 'Mandarin Chinese'. These modifications undermine the enforceability of the dispute resolution process.",

                "original_text": "The Parties agree that the Parties will not disclose information in connection with the execution, existence, content, and performance of this Agreement to any third party before the Parties have made an announcement to the public pursuant to Section 3.11 of this Agreement. However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that they will generally avoid discussing the details of this agreement with outside parties. However, this restriction is optional and does not apply to anyone the Parties deem necessary to inform.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a clear confidentiality obligation with specific exceptions. The modified clause weakens this significantly by making the confidentiality 'optional' and broadening the exceptions to 'anyone the Parties deem necessary to inform.' This introduces ambiguity and renders the confidentiality clause largely unenforceable. The original clause implies a responsibility to protect sensitive information, whereas the modified clause implies no such requirement.",

                "original_text": "Therefore, the Parties agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available in common law or equity, each Party shall be entitled to seek injunction and other equitable remedies, including the actual performance of the terms and conditions provided herein, and it is not necessary to post any bond or other security.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that seeking legal action for breaches is a possibility, but not a requirement.",
                "explanation": "This modification undermines the possibility of 'actual performance'. The original clause provides for injunctions and other equitable remedies, specifically including the right to compel performance. The changed text replaces this with a vague statement that seeking legal action is only a 'possibility, but not a requirement.' This removes the guaranteed right to specific performance, making the contract significantly less enforceable.",

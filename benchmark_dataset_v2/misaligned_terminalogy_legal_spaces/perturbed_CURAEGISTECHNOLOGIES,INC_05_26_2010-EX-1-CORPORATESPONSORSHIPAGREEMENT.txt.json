                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party (i) files a petition commencing a voluntary case under the  Bankruptcy Code; (ii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become  due; (iv) seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of it or any part of its property; or (v) has  commenced against it an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or a proceeding under any receivership, composition, readjustment,  liquidation, insolvency, dissolution or like law or statute, which case or proceeding is not dismissed or vacated within sixty (60) days.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party (i) initiates a bankruptcy filing; (ii) attempts to assign assets; (iii) acknowledges difficulty in debt repayment; (iv) seeks a fiduciary appointment; or (v) faces an insolvency process that is not resolved within ninety (90) days.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses precise legal terms defined under the Bankruptcy Code, such as 'files a petition commencing a voluntary case under the Bankruptcy Code' and 'makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.' The modified text replaces these with more ambiguous, layman terms like 'initiates a bankruptcy filing' and 'attempts to assign assets.' These lack the specific legal meaning, potentially leading to disputes about what triggers termination and contradicting established bankruptcy law.",

The  parties agree that each of them hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the New York State and federal courts for the purpose of resolving any  dispute arising under this Agreement and that the exclusive venue for resolution of such disputes shall be state or federal courts located in  Monroe County, New York.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is to be interpreted generally under principles of fairness. The parties agree to attempt resolution in any venue deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies New York law and jurisdiction in Monroe County. The modified text replaces this with 'principles of fairness' and removes the defined jurisdiction/venue. This contradicts established contract law principles regarding choice of law and forum selection clauses, introducing ambiguity and making enforcement unpredictable.",

                "changed_text": "Vendor generally believes it has the ability to enter into this agreement, and will attempt to follow regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses the words 'represents and warrants', which create binding promises with legal consequences if untrue. The modified text weakens this to 'generally believes' and 'will attempt,' removing the force of the warranties and representations. This contradicts standard contract law principles regarding warranties, creating ambiguity as to the vendor's obligations and reducing legal enforceability.",

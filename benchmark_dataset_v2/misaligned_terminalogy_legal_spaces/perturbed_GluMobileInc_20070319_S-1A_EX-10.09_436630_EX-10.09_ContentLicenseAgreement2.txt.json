                "original_text": "Licensee shall pay to Fox Royalties at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's gross receipts from Licensee's sale, license, distribution or other exploitation of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall pay to Fox Royalties at a negotiable rate of Licensee's overall revenue from Licensee's distribution of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed royalty rate based on 'gross receipts'. The modified text replaces this with a 'negotiable rate' based on 'overall revenue'. Gross receipts has a specific accounting definition. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard accounting practices, making enforcement uncertain. It violates principles of contract law requiring clear and definite terms.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall have the flexible right and license to possibly develop and distribute ICE AGE 2 Wireless Products for all Wireless Products except for the Game, for which Licensee shall have the preferred, but not guaranteed, license to develop and distribute until December 31, 2006.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants 'non-exclusive' and 'exclusive' rights. The modification replaces these with 'flexible' and 'preferred, but not guaranteed'. This significantly weakens the licensee's rights. 'Flexible' and 'preferred' lack legal definition, making enforcement highly uncertain and contradicting the originally intended exclusivity and non-exclusivity.",

                "changed_text": "Fox may produce the KOH Video Clips, and Licensee could potentially reimburse Fox for some portion of the production expenses, which expenses might be considered towards the Guarantee payable to Fox based on mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Fox will produce the clips and the licensee will reimburse all costs, which cannot be used to recoup the guarantee. The modified text changes this to a possibility, introducing several ambiguities. The licensee potentially reimburses a 'portion' of expenses, and these expenses 'might be considered' toward the guarantee. This contradicts the original intent and introduces subjectivity into cost recovery, making it difficult to enforce the financial obligations under the agreement.",

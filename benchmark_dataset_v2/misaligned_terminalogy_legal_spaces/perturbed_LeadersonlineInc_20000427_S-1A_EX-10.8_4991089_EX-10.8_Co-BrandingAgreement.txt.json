                "original_text": "1.1. Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a Party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Party.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting power of a Party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such Party.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a Party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly affiliated with such Party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means any level of influence a Party exerts over another.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' includes a clear threshold for 'control' (50% ownership). The modified definition removes the specific ownership percentage and replaces it with 'any level of influence'. This creates ambiguity and contradicts standard legal definitions of control, potentially leading to disputes over which entities are considered affiliates, especially under Pennsylvania state corporate law.",

Confidential Information shall mean, subject to the provisions of Section 9.2  [Exclusions], all proprietary and confidential information of a Party, including, without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, business information, sales information, customer and potential customer lists and identities, product sales plans, sublicense agreements, inventions, developments, discoveries, software, know-how, methods, techniques, formulae, data, processes and other proprietary ideas, whether or not protectable under patent, trademark, copyright or other areas of law, that the other Party has access to or receives. For purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be considered Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "1.4. Confidential Information shall mean information deemed sensitive by the disclosing party. Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to, data the disclosing party considers private. For purposes of this Agreement, only information clearly marked as 'Confidential' shall be considered Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "This modification changes the definition of 'Confidential Information' from a well-defined set of categories to a subjective determination by the disclosing party, requiring explicit labeling. This contradicts standard legal definitions of trade secrets and confidential business information, which often do not require explicit labeling to be protected. This also introduces ambiguity and could render confidentiality clauses unenforceable, as it conflicts with Pennsylvania's Uniform Trade Secrets Act.",

This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create an employer-employee, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties.  Neither Party shall have any authority to act for or to bind the other Party in any way, to alter any of the terms or conditions of any of the other Party's standard forms of invoices, sales agreements, warranties or otherwise, or to warrant or to execute agreements on behalf of the other or to represent that it is in any way responsible for the acts, debts, liabilities or omissions of the other Party.",
                "changed_text": "12.6. Independent Contractors. In connection with this Agreement, each Party is an independent contractor. This Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship, but it does establish an agency relationship where VerticalNet can act on behalf of LeadersOnline in certain sales and marketing activities. Neither Party shall have any authority to alter the other Party's invoices, sales agreements, or warranties, except VerticalNet can negotiate specific terms on behalf of LeadersOnline for VerticalNet-LeadersOnline Clients.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the parties are independent contractors, then establishing an agency relationship where VerticalNet can act on behalf of LeadersOnline. Under Pennsylvania law, an agency relationship implies a certain level of control and fiduciary duty that is inconsistent with an independent contractor status. Furthermore, granting VerticalNet the authority to negotiate terms on behalf of LeadersOnline for specific clients blurs the lines of independent contractor status and potentially creates liabilities for LeadersOnline.",

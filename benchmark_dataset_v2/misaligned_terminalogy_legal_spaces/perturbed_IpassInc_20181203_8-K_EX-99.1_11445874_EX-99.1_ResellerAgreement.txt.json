                "explanation": "The original definition requires an 'eligible subscriber ID' for a person to be considered an 'End User'. The modified definition removes this requirement, allowing the Channel Partner to designate anyone as an 'End User' even if they don't meet the technical requirements for accessing iPass services. This contradicts the intended user verification process and could lead to disputes over billing and service access.",

The iPass Network is subject to change by iPass upon notice to Partner, on condition that such changes do not materially degrade the network. The iPass Network does not include certain Wi-Fi services that are subject to supplier enforced restrictions. In addition, if any country is subject to a US embargo or other export restriction, it will not be deemed included in the foregoing list, the iPass Network will not be available from such country, and Customer agrees not to use the Licensed Software or the iPass Network in such country..",

The iPass Network may include or exclude any internet access points as iPass sees fit, regardless of supplier restrictions or legal limitations. Customer agrees to hold iPass harmless for any usage of the Licensed Software or the iPass Network.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies the composition of the 'iPass Network' and imposes conditions on changes to the network. The modified definition broadens the scope to any internet access point and removes restrictions on iPass' ability to alter the network.

                "explanation": "The original section specifies targeted response times for support requests based on severity. The modified definition eliminates the targeted response times and replaces them with vague and discretionary language.

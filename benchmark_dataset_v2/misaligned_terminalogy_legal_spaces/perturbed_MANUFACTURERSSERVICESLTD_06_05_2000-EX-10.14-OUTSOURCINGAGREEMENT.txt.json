                "explanation": "The term **\"Equipment and Program Loan Agreement\"** was replaced with **\"Loan of Equipment Program Agreement\"**. This change introduces a subtle legal uncertainty. While both terms sound similar, the specific wording of \"Equipment and Program Loan Agreement\" might have a more established meaning or legal precedent within the context of asset lending and borrowing, particularly concerning software and hardware. The altered term could be interpreted differently, potentially affecting liability and obligations related to the loaned items.",

The change will cause confusion because the term `parts` has clear and well-defined meaning which is changed with `materials`, `recommended`, and `loaned materials`. This is a legal contradiction because the original terms have explicit definitions with associated liabilities, quality controls, and purchasing obligations.",

This change introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes a 'convenient price' versus a 'reasonable price' under market standards. A reasonable price typically implies fair market value, whereas 'convenient' is subjective.

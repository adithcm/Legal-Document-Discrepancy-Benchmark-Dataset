                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, USA in force therein without regard to its conflict of law rules. All parties agree that by executing this Agreement they have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, USA in force therein without regard to its conflict of law rules. All parties agree that by executing this Agreement they have attorned to the jurisdiction of the Nevada State Courts. The Nevada State Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text incorrectly asserts that the Supreme Court of the United States has exclusive jurisdiction over the contract. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is primarily appellate and doesn't typically extend to initial contract disputes. The altered text specifies 'Nevada State Courts' which aligns with general jurisdictional principles for contract disputes within a state, but contradicts the initial clause referencing the Supreme Court, thereby creating confusion. It makes it difficult to determine whether it is Nevada state law or federal law to be followed.",

                "original_text": "Dolphin shall maintain at its principal place of business, or such other place as may be most convenient, separate accounts and records of all services provided to DGT, such accounts and records to be in sufficient detail to enable proper returns to be made under this Agreement. Dolphin shall deliver to DGT on the date 30 days after each and every year a detailed photo-editing report on all services provided on a unit basis (i.e. customer number, file number, cost). The calculation shall be carried out in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), or the standards and principles adopted by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") applied on a consistent basis.",
                "changed_text": "Dolphin shall maintain at its principal place of business, or such other place as may be most convenient, separate accounts and records of all services provided to DGT, such accounts and records to be in sufficient detail to enable proper returns to be made under this Agreement. Dolphin shall deliver to DGT on the date 30 days after each and every year a photo-editing report on all services provided. The calculation can be carried out using any accounting principles Dolphin deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly requires adherence to U.S. GAAP or FASB standards for financial reporting. The modified text removes this requirement and introduces ambiguity by stating that the calculation can be carried out using any accounting principles Dolphin deems appropriate. This change introduces uncertainty and contradicts generally accepted business practices, potentially rendering the reporting unreliable and legally dubious. GAAP is widely accepted, and removes the need for interpretation. Removing it creates a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and material obligation hereunder and only after DGT have given Dolphin written notice of such failure and only after Dolphin has not rectified such failure within 10 days of the notice. Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet a material obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT written notice of such failure and only after the DGT has not rectified such failure within 30 days of the notice.",
                "changed_text": "DGT shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if Dolphin fails to meet its requirements and obligation hereunder and only after DGT have given Dolphin verbal notice of such failure. Dolphin shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement only after DGT fails to meet an obligation hereunder and only after Dolphin has given DGT electronic notice of such failure.",
                "explanation": "The original termination clause stipulates a requirement for written notice and a 10/30-day cure period for breaches before termination. The modified clause removes the material qualifier and written stipulation in DGT's breach of the agreement, and allows for Dolphin to provide electronic notification which lacks certainty and verifiability compared to written notice. This undermines the clarity and enforceability of the termination clause. The contradiction introduces ambiguity about what constitutes sufficient notice and proper process for termination which would be argued in a court of law.",

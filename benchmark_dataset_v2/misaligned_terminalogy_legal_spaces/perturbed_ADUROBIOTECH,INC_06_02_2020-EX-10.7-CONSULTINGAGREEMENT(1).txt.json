                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor. Consultant shall be responsible for the timely payment of his or her own self-employment and income taxes. Neither party shall have any authority to bind the other.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant's relationship to Aduro shall be that of an independent contractor. Aduro will handle all tax withholdings and payments for the Consultant. Aduro shall have the authority to direct the Consultant's activities in detail.",
                "explanation": "The original text correctly identifies the consultant as an independent contractor, making them responsible for their taxes and limiting Aduro's control. The modified text contradicts this by stating Aduro will handle tax withholdings, implying an employer-employee relationship, and gives Aduro broad authority to direct the consultant. This creates a legal contradiction because independent contractors are not subject to employer tax withholdings, and the degree of control suggests misclassification under California labor law.",

                "original_text": "(a) \"Confidential Information\" means any information, materials or methods in whatever form or embodiment that has not been made available by Aduro to the general public and any information, materials or methods in the possession or control of Consultant on the Effective Date or developed in the performance of the Services, except that Confidential Information shall not include any information, material or method that (i) at the time of disclosure is in, or after disclosure becomes part of the public domain, through no improper act on the part of Consultant or any of its employees; (ii) was in Consultant's possession at the time of disclosure, as shown by written evidence, and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from work with Aduro; or (iii) Consultant receives from a third party, provided that such Confidential Information was not obtained by such third party, directly or indirectly, from Aduro.",
                "changed_text": "(a) \"Confidential Information\" means any information Aduro deems confidential, regardless of whether it is available to the general public or known to the Consultant prior to this agreement. Exceptions include only information Consultant is legally compelled to disclose.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Confidential Information\" excludes information already in the public domain or rightfully in the consultant's possession. The modified definition broadens the scope to include any information Aduro deems confidential, regardless of public availability or prior knowledge, except for legally compelled disclosures. This contradicts established trade secret law, which typically does not protect information already publicly known. California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) requires that the information be secret and provide economic value.",

                "original_text": "6. Intellectual Property. Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.",
                "changed_text": "6. Intellectual Property. Aduro shall have priority rights to Work Product. Consultant retains joint ownership rights unless Aduro notifies Consultant otherwise. Consultant must seek Aduro's consent before using or disclosing Work Product outside the direct scope of Services and Consultant will seek their own patents, copyrights, and trademarks for this Work Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Aduro as the sole owner of all intellectual property. The modified text allows Consultant to keep joint ownership and gives them rights to seek patents, copyrights and trademarks for their Work Product. This creates a legal contradiction because it conflicts with the initial agreement and could lead to disputes over intellectual property rights and inventorship under U.S. patent law.",

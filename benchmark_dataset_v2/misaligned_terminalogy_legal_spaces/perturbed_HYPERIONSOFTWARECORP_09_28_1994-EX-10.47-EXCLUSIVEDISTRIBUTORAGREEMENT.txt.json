                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Developer hereby grants to Distributor an exclusive, non-transferable fight and license to market and distribute the Products in the Territory. Distributor shall distribute the Products to existing and new customers of Distributor located in the Territory (the \"End-Users\") who enter into an End-User License Agreement (as hereinafter defined).",
                "changed_text": "Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Developer hereby grants to Distributor a non-exclusive, transferable fight and license to market and distribute the Products in the Territory. Distributor shall distribute the Products to existing and new customers of Distributor located in the Territory (the \"End-Users\") who enter into an End-User License Agreement (as hereinafter defined).",
                "explanation": "Changing 'exclusive, non-transferable' to 'non-exclusive, transferable' directly contradicts the initial grant of rights. An exclusive license, by definition, grants sole rights, while a transferable right allows the distributor to sublicense the rights to another entity without developer consent. This fundamental shift introduces ambiguity and potential legal challenges regarding the scope of the distributor's permitted actions.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall aim to assist with installation, maintenance, consulting and support services to the End-Users with regard to the Products.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'solely responsible' to 'aim to assist' fundamentally alters the distributor's obligation. The original clause clearly places the full burden of support on the distributor, while the modified version suggests a more advisory or optional role. This shift creates uncertainty regarding who bears the ultimate responsibility for these critical services, which could lead to disputes.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut, U.S.A. without regard to its conflict of taws provision. Jurisdiction for litigation of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof shall be only in the Federal or the State court with competent jurisdiction located in Stamford, Connecticut.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be subject to mediation in Singapore, and if mediation fails, legal claims can be filed in any jurisdiction that the Distributor chooses. The governing law will be chosen at the discretion of the Distributor. The interpretation of governing law may differ significantly based on the chosen jurisdiction, thus creating uncertainty.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from Connecticut law to a law chosen at the discretion of the Distributor, contradicts common legal practices regarding jurisdiction. The original clause specifies a clear legal framework and venue for dispute resolution, ensuring predictability and fairness. The change introduces uncertainty and potential forum shopping, allowing the distributor to select a jurisdiction that may be more favorable to its position, thus undermining the enforceability of the contract.",

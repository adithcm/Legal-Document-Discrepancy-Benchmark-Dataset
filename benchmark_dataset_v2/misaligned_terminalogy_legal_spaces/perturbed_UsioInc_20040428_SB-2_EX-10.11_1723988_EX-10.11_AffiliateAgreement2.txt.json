                "explanation": "Changing \"Contractor(s)\" to \"Worker(s)\" introduces ambiguity. While the contract later attempts to define these individuals as independent contractors, the initial use of \"Worker(s)\" can be interpreted under employment laws, potentially misclassifying them and leading to disputes over employee benefits and tax liabilities.",

Affiliate  shall  use its best efforts to market and sell to  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries and  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Contractors of  Network  1  and Affiliate subject to the approval of all such individuals by Network  1  as  set  out  in  Section  2.01  [CONTRACTORS].",

Affiliate  shall  use its best efforts to market and sell to  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries and  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Staff of  Network  1  and Affiliate subject to the approval of all such individuals by Network  1  as  set  out  in  Section  2.01  [CONTRACTORS].",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"Contractors\" with \"Staff\" can blur the line between independent contractors and employees. \"Staff\" typically implies a degree of control and integration within the company structure, conflicting with the intended independent contractor relationship.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"guarantees\" with \"suggests\" diminishes the legal obligation of the Affiliate to ensure payments for equipment and software purchased by merchants or commercial businesses. A guarantee is a firm promise, while a suggestion is merely advisory and not legally binding. This undermines the financial security intended by the original contract.",

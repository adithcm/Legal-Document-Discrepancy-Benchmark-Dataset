                "explanation": "The terms 'felony', 'violation of a franchise, antitrust or securities law', 'fraud', 'embezzlement', 'fraudulent conversion', 'misappropriation of property', 'unfair or deceptive practices' are replaced with more ambiguous terms like 'major crime', 'breach of contract', 'business tort', 'theft', 'significant conversion', 'improper use of assets', 'unfair competition'. This introduces uncertainty, as the legal definitions of the original terms are well-established under New York law (as indicated by the addendum's requirement by the Department of Law of the State of New York), whereas the modified terms are open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The original text refers specifically to actions under the 'U.S. Bankruptcy Code'. The modified text uses vague terms like 'financial hardship' and 'debts forgiven'. This introduces ambiguity, as these terms are not legally defined and do not necessarily equate to a bankruptcy filing or discharge, thereby weakening the disclosure requirements. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides specific legal definitions and protections, which are bypassed by this modification.",

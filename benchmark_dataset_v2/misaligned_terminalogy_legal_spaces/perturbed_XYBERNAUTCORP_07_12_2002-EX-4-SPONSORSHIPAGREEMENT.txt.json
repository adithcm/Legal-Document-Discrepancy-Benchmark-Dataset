                "original_text": "AJR agrees to designate XC as an associate sponsor and the \"exclusive technology sponsor\" for wearable computer technology\" of the Team for the Season and grants to XC the rights and benefits of such sponsorship as more fully set forth herein.",
                "changed_text": "AJR agrees to designate XC as an associate sponsor and the \"primary marketing partner\" of the Team for the Season and grants to XC the rights and benefits of such sponsorship as more fully set forth herein.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"exclusive technology sponsor\" to \"primary marketing partner\" creates ambiguity. \"Exclusive technology sponsor\" has a specific connotation related to technical contributions and potentially IP. \"Primary marketing partner\" is vague and could be interpreted in numerous ways, leading to disputes about the scope of the sponsorship and conflicting with standard definitions of sponsorship roles.",

                "original_text": "In addition, upon the occurrence of an AJR Event of Default any of the Warrants which have not been exercised shall automatically terminate and be void and all of the Shares and any shares of Common Stock issued in the exercise of the Warrants shall be purchasable by XC at the purchase price of $1.00.  Upon XC tendering the purchase price, AJR shall promptly deliver to XC the certificates for the Shares and any shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of the Warrants, together with duly executed blank stock powers.",
                "changed_text": "In addition, upon the occurrence of an AJR Event of Default any of the Warrants which have not been exercised shall automatically terminate and be void and all of the Shares and any shares of Common Stock issued in the exercise of the Warrants may be repurchased by XC at a mutually agreed upon fair market value.  Upon XC notifying AJR of its intent to repurchase, AJR shall negotiate in good faith with XC to determine the fair market value of the shares.",
                "explanation": "Changing the repurchase price from a fixed $1.00 to a \"mutually agreed upon fair market value\" introduces a contradiction. The original clause provides a clear, defined consequence for an event of default. The changed clause introduces ambiguity and requires negotiation, potentially conflicting with established legal precedents regarding contractually agreed upon remedies.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "XC and AJR shall not be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations hereunder which is principally the result of the occurrence of an Event of Force Majeure.  In the event of any such delay or failure, XC or AJR, as applicable, shall immediately furnish written notice thereof and the reason therefor to the other party. The performance of XC or AJR, as applicable shall be deemed suspended so long as and to the extent that any such Event Force Majeure continues.",
                "changed_text": "XC and AJR shall not be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations hereunder which is principally the result of the occurrence of an unforeseen circumstance. In the event of any such delay or failure, XC or AJR, as applicable, shall furnish notice when practically possible. The performance of XC or AJR, as applicable shall be suspended until determined otherwise by the party experiencing the unforeseen circumstance.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the defined term \"Event of Force Majeure\" with the ambiguous term \"unforeseen circumstance\" and replacing \"immediately furnish written notice thereof\" with \"furnish notice when practically possible\" weakens the clause and makes it difficult to enforce. This contradicts the intent of force majeure clauses, which are designed to provide clear and predictable relief in specific, extraordinary circumstances and creates uncertainty in contract enforcement.",

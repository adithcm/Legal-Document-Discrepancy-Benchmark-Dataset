                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence as of April 1, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\") and shall expire as determined solely by the Club, notwithstanding the conclusion of the 2022/23 NFL season or any date specified herein, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification gives the Club sole discretion to determine the end date of the contract, conflicting with the initially defined \"Scheduled Expiration Date.\" This introduces uncertainty about the Term's true duration, making enforcement problematic because the contract now contains contradictory terms regarding its end date. Contract law requires clear terms for enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, irrespective of the payment of Sponsor Fees, Club may allow Sponsor to use the Benefits set forth on Exhibit A and the license and right to use the Team Marks solely in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Sponsor's Dick's Wings and Grill branded restaurants (the \"Sponsor Business\") in accordance with this Agreement; and (ii) the right to use the designation \"Official Wings of the Jacksonville Jaguars\" and such other designations as Club and Sponsor may agree to, or not agree to, in a writing from time to time (collectively, the \"Official Designations\"), at Club's sole discretion, solely in connection with the Sponsor Business.",
                "explanation": "This modification makes the granting of sponsorship rights and benefits discretionary for the Club, regardless of whether the Sponsor has paid the required fees. The phrase 'irrespective of the payment of Sponsor Fees' contradicts the original intent, which tied the granting of rights directly to payment. This creates uncertainty regarding whether the Sponsor actually receives the agreed-upon benefits, despite fulfilling its financial obligations. 'Club may allow' removes the obligation and places the sponsorship benefits at the discretion of the Club, also the 'or not agree to'.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires Sponsor to pay the Annual Fee in six equal installments with specific due dates. The modified text changes this to allow Sponsor to pay in installments, the timing and amount of which will be decided at Sponsor's convenience. The word 'attempt' removes the obligation for the sponsor to make the payments entirely, and the phrase 'timing and amount of which shall be determined at Sponsor's convenience' makes it entirely at the discretion of the sponsor, creating a legal contradiction. Contract law requires clear terms for enforcement.",

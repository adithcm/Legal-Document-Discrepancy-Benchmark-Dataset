                "original_text": "c) \"FINANCIAL SERVICES\" shall mean banking, lending, financial and wealth management products and services offered by Berkshire  and insurance products and services offered by Berkshire's affiliate Berkshire Insurance Group, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "c) \"FINANCIAL SERVICES\" shall generally mean products and services offered by Berkshire and insurance products and services offered by Berkshire's affiliate Berkshire Insurance Group, Inc. The specifics of these services may change without notice.",
                "explanation": "By adding the phrase 'The specifics of these services may change without notice,' the contract now contradicts the original, more specific definition of 'Financial Services.' This creates uncertainty about the scope of Auriemma's endorsement obligations and Berkshire's service offerings, potentially violating consumer protection laws requiring clarity in financial service agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates consumer protection laws requiring clarity in financial service agreements.",

                "changed_text": "b) Auriemma grants to Berkshire the right and license (the \"License Rights\") to use the Auriemma Identification during the Contract Period within Berkshire's discretion. The details of use are subject to change at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Berkshire an 'exclusive right' to use Auriemma's likeness, while the revised text removes the 'exclusive' element, implying Berkshire can use it at its discretion, subject to change. This contradicts the originally defined 'License Rights' which implies a specific exclusivity agreement. This could be problematic with intellectual property law, potentially leading to disputes over the extent and conditions of the granted rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract regarding defined License Rights/ Potential IP law violations.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Connecticut law governs the agreement. The modified version introduces ambiguity by allowing Berkshire to choose the governing state law. This contradicts the principle of mutual agreement on jurisdiction, making the clause unenforceable. It could also violate legal principles requiring clarity and predictability in contract terms, specifically regarding which state's laws apply.",

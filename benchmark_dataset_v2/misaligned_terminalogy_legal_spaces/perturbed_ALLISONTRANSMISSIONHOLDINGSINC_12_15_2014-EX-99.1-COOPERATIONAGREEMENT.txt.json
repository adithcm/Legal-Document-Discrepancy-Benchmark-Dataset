                "changed_text": "(c) The ValueAct Designee agrees that, at all times while serving as a member of the Board, he will (i) endeavor to meet some director independence and other standards of the Company, the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule 10A- 3; and (ii) aim to be qualified to serve as a director under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") (clauses (i) and (ii), the \"Conditions\").",
                "explanation": "Changing 'meet all director independence' to 'endeavor to meet some director independence' weakens the requirement. Similarly, replacing 'be qualified' with 'aim to be qualified' introduces ambiguity. Director independence is strictly defined by the SEC and NYSE. By using weaker language, the contract deviates from these statutory definitions, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the independence requirement.",

                "explanation": "This modification contains several deviations from established legal standards:\n\nChanging 'unless specifically requested in writing by the Company, acting through a resolution of a majority of the Company's directors' to 'unless specifically requested in writing by the Company, acting through an informal communication of a single Company director' weakens the requirement for a formal board resolution, making it easier for the ValueAct Group to act contrary to the standstill provision, against the intentions of Delaware's Corporate Law.\n\nChanging 'shall not' to 'should not' weakens the obligation, from what it should be, as ValueAct Group agrees.\n\nModifying 'Affiliates or Associates (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act)' to 'Affiliates or Associates (as such terms are generally understood)' introduces an informal understanding of the terms, which would bring legal uncertainty.\n\nThe language used for the portfolio company (has perhaps, possibly, debatably), create more room for ambiguity for ValueAct to be released from responsibility.",

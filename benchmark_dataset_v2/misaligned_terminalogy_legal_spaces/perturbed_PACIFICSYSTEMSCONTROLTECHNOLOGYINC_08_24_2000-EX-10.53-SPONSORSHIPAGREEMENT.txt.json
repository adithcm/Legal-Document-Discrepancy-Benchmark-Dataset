                "original_text": "ACM retains all of its rights under copyright and trademark laws pertaining to the Event's intellectual property, whether registered or unregistered, and any applications of the Event's logo, name, characters and likeness.  Video and audio excerpts of the Event must have ACM's approval in writing prior to such use.  The Sponsor shall retain all of its rights under copyright and trademark laws pertaining to any of its intellectual property.",
                "changed_text": "ACM retains all of its rights under copyright and trademark laws pertaining to the Event's intellectual property, but these rights are subject to SLD's discretion. Video and audio excerpts of the Event require no approval for the Sponsor's use. The Sponsor shall retain only some of its rights under copyright and trademark laws pertaining to any of its intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several conflicting terms. Copyright and trademark laws grant specific, legally protected rights. Stating these rights are 'subject to SLD's discretion' contradicts established intellectual property law. Further, stating that 'video and audio excerpts...require no approval' directly opposes copyright law. Limiting the Sponsor's IP rights to 'some' is also contradictory, as IP rights are typically all-encompassing unless explicitly limited by contract.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be vaguely influenced by the laws of the State of California, the laws of Hong Kong and only when convenient. In the event of a dispute, the parties may consider mediation in a country selected randomly.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly specifies which jurisdictions' laws govern the agreement, providing legal certainty. The modified text replaces 'governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with' with 'vaguely influenced by', undermining the legal basis for enforcement. Stating that the influence is 'only when convenient' adds further ambiguity. Specifying a 'third country mutually agreed upon' for mediation is changed to 'a country selected randomly' which is against any established mediation procedure.",

                "changed_text": "For the above sponsorship components, the Sponsor agrees to potentially pay ACM an approximate amount of US$400,000.00. The payment schedule may be adjusted as necessary by ACM.",
                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a clear and definite financial obligation. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'agrees to potentially pay', 'total amount' with 'approximate amount', and 'is payable 180 days from the date of the Event' with 'may be adjusted as necessary by ACM'. This change contradicts basic contract law principles requiring certainty in payment terms.",

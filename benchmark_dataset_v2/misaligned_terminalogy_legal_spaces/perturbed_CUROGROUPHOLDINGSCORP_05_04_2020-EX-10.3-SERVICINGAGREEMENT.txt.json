                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(a) The Owner authorizes Curo Management, LLC, to act, and Curo Management, LLC, agrees to act, as an independent contractor, as the Servicer effective upon the date hereof.",
                "changed_text": "(a) The Owner authorizes Curo Management, LLC, to act, and Curo Management, LLC, agrees to act, as an agent of the Owner, as the Servicer effective upon the date hereof.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'agent of the Owner' creates a direct conflict. An independent contractor operates autonomously, while an agent is subject to the principal's control. This contradiction introduces uncertainty regarding the Servicer's duties and liabilities under agency law and contract law.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it hereunder,\n\n\n\nincluding any Sub-Servicer, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Servicing Agreement and the Servicing Standard. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless such power is revoked by the Owner on account of the occurrence of a Servicer Default, the Servicer shall have full power and authority (i) to make withdrawals from the applicable servicer collection account permitted by the terms of this Servicing Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document and (ii) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Owner, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable Servicing Standard and the Loan Agreement, to commence collection proceedings with respect to such Receivables.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer shall have some power and limited authority, acting only under the Owner's instruction, to do only those things strictly required for basic servicing. The Owner may at its sole discretion approve any actions. The Servicer only is granted the authority to make only routine withdrawals and is forbidden from executing any instruments on behalf of the Owner.",
                "explanation": "This modification severely restricts the Servicer's authority, conflicting with the original grant of 'full power and authority'. It mandates Owner approval for almost all actions and explicitly prohibits executing instruments, which contradicts the initial intent of the Servicing Agreement and could lead to operational inefficiencies and potential breaches of contract. The term 'routine' is not explicitly defined, making the authority uncertain.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement. The Servicing Fee shall be payable on each Payment Date for the immediately prior Servicing Period in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.",
                "changed_text": "The Servicer may be entitled to a discretionary payment, if the Owner deems the Servicer has performed the duties exceptionally well. This payment will be determined at the Owner's sole discretion, not exceeding 1% of the serviced assets, and only if profits allow. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Servicer.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a clearly defined Servicing Fee with a discretionary payment based on undefined 'exceptional performance'. This contradicts the original agreement for a fixed fee and shifts the financial burden of additional services to the Servicer. This creates uncertainty about the Servicer's compensation and incentivizes them to underperform.",

                "original_text": "14.1. This Agreement does not constitute Developer an agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee or servant of Franchisor for any purpose whatsoever, and it is understood between the parties hereto that Developer shall be an independent contractor and is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty or representation on behalf of El Pollo Loco. The parties agree that this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship between them.",
                "changed_text": "14.1. This Agreement constitutes Developer as a representative of Franchisor for marketing purposes, and it is understood between the parties hereto that Developer shall be considered as a part-time consultant and is authorized to make representations on behalf of El Pollo Loco within the scope of approved marketing campaigns. The parties agree that this Agreement creates a fiduciary relationship between them regarding the marketing activities.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the Developer is an independent contractor and not an agent or employee, consistent with standard franchising practices. The modified text contradicts this by designating the Developer as a 'representative' and 'part-time consultant,' implying an agency relationship and creating a fiduciary duty. This contradicts the definition of an 'independent contractor' under US labor law, creating potential liability for El Pollo Loco regarding the Developer's actions.",

This Agreement, after review by Developer and El Pollo Loco, was accepted in the state in which Franchisor's then-current headquarters (currently the State of California) is located and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of such state, except that the provisions in Section 20.1 covering competition following the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state in which the breach occurs. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY COURT, WHETHER FEDERAL OR STATE, WILL BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE STATE IN WHICH FRANCHISOR'S HEADQUARTERS (CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA) IS THEN LOCATED. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO DEMAND OR HAVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FRANCHISOR IS A PARTY. THE PARTIES CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THEM BY SUCH COURTS AND TO THE PROPRIETY OF VENUE OF SUCH COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING OUT THE PROVISION, AND THEY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO THE SAME. ANY ACTION BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND FRANCHISOR SHALL INVOLVE ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS OF DEVELOPER AND SHALL NOT INVOLVE ANY CLASS, GROUP, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR ASSOCIATIONAL ACTION. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 18.1 IS INTENDED BY THE PARTIES TO SUBJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY FRANCHISE OR SIMILAR LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO WHICH THIS AGREEMENT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT.",
                "changed_text": "18.1. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state most favorable to the Franchisor at the time of any dispute. The parties agree that any action brought by either party against each other in any court, whether federal or state, will be brought in a venue selected at the Franchisor's sole discretion. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE TO BINDING ARBITRATION, WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY ACTION BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND FRANCHISOR MAY INVOLVE CLASS, GROUP, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR ASSOCIATIONAL ACTION.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies California law and waives jury trials. The modified clause changes the governing law to be 'most favorable' to the Franchisor, which is vague and unenforceable. Additionally, it enforces mandatory binding arbitration, thus removing the right to a trial by jury. Further, it allows for class action lawsuits that would normally be waived under a franchise agreement. These changes contradict standard contract law principles about choice of law and jury trial waivers, potentially making the clause unenforceable and causing legal disputes.",

To further protect the El Pollo Loco® System while this Agreement is in effect, Developer and each officer, director, shareholder, member, manager, partner and other equity owner, as applicable, of Developer, if Developer is an entity, shall neither directly nor indirectly own, operate, control or any financial interest in any other business which would constitute a \"Competitive Business\" (as hereinafter defined) without the prior written consent of Franchisor; provided further, that Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right, consent to the Developer's continued operation of any business already in existence and operating at the time of execution of this Agreement. In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory. The foregoing shall not apply to operation of an El Pollo Loco® restaurant by Developer pursuant to a Franchise Agreement with Franchisor or the ownership by Developer of less than five percent (5%) of the issued or outstanding stock of any company whose shares are listed for trading on any public exchange or on the over-the-counter market, provided that Developer does not control or become involved in the operations of any such company. For purposes of this Section 20.1, a Competitive Business shall mean a self-service restaurant or fast-food business which sells chicken and/or Mexican food products, which products individually or collectively represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues from such self-service restaurant or fast-food business operated at any one location during any calendar quarter. A \"Competitive Business\" shall not include a full-service restaurant.",

For purposes of this Section 20.1, a Business shall mean any commercial activity.",
                "explanation": "The original non-compete clause is limited to 'Competitive Business' within the Territory and has a two-year time limit. The modified clause broadens the scope to 'any business of any kind' located 'anywhere in the world' and extends the duration to 'forever.' This creates an overly broad and unreasonable restriction, conflicting with established legal principles regarding the enforceability of non-compete agreements. Courts typically strike down non-compete clauses that are not limited in scope, geography, and time, as they are considered an unreasonable restraint of trade.",

                "original_text": "The term of this agreement will begin on April 1, 2018 and continue until April 30, 2018 at 11:59pm.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this agreement will begin on April 1, 2018 and continue indefinitely, subject to termination based on promoter's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a fixed term with an indefinite term that can be terminated at the promoter's discretion. This contradicts the concept of a defined contract term, creating legal uncertainty about the duration of the agreement and potentially violating principles of contract law regarding mutual agreement on essential terms.",

                "changed_text": "The parties are considered collaborators, with the Sponsor acting as an agent of the Promoter for marketing purposes. This Agreement creates an agency relationship for promotional activities.",
                "explanation": "This directly contradicts the original clause stating the parties are independent contractors. The modified text establishes an agency relationship, which carries significantly different legal implications regarding liability, control, and fiduciary duties. This misclassification can create issues related to vicarious liability and potential labor law violations, specifically the laws regarding independent contractors versus agents.",

(iv) any changes in company value or brand value. The attendance and marketing reach estimates made in negotiations were made for the purposes of this agreement are mere estimate and not be interpreted as guaranties.",

                "explanation": "This modification expands the indemnification clause to include liabilities arising from the Promoter's gross negligence. Standard indemnification clauses generally do not cover a party's own gross negligence or intentional misconduct. By forcing the Sponsor to indemnify the Promoter even for the Promoter's own severe misconduct, this clause contradicts established legal principles regarding the scope and enforceability of indemnification agreements.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "5.3.2  REPAIR AND  MAINTENANCE.  The  Franchisee  shall,  at its own expense,  continuously  throughout  the  Term of this  Agreement,  maintain  the Franchised Restaurant in good condition and repair in accordance with BKC's then current repair and maintenance standards.",
                "changed_text": "5.3.2  REPAIR AND  MAINTENANCE.  The  Franchisee  shall,  at its own expense,  periodically throughout the  Term of this  Agreement,  maintain  the Franchised Restaurant with only necessary maintenance. The franchisee determines what BKC standards should be followed.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the frequency and necessity of maintenance, and putting responsibility of BKC standards on the franchisee, there is now uncertainty over whether regular upkeep is required, deviating from standard franchise maintenance obligations and potentially leading to disputes over property condition.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable care and maintenance of leased commercial properties.",

                "explanation": "This modification gives the franchisee freedom to choose brands or menu items that were not authorized by BKC, which can cause confusion and legal complications since food and beverages are not coming from authorized suppliers. This can be considered a food and safety law violation.",

                "explanation": "This modification that 'BKC can have control over the terms and conditions of employment of the Franchisee's employees.' Directly contradicts the definition of an independent contractor, creating potential liability for BKC under employment law and misclassifying franchisee employees.",

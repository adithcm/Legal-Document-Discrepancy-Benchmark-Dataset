                "original_text": "This is the First Amendment (\"First Amendment\") to the Development Agreement (\"Development Agreement\") entered into on April 15, 2010, by  and between Cargill, Incorporated through its Bio Technology Development Center, having its principal place of business at 15407 McGinty Road  West, Wayzata, Minnesota 55391 USA (\"Cargill\") and BioAmber S.A.S., having a place of business at Route de Bazancourt, F-51110, Pomacle  France (\"BioAmber\"). This First Amendment will be effective as of July 5, 2011, upon the signature of both Cargill and BioAmber.",

This Initial Amendment will be effective as of July 5, 2011, upon the signature of both Cargill and BioAmber.",
                "explanation": "The term 'First Amendment' has a specific legal meaning relating to constitutional rights within the United States. By renaming it 'Initial Amendment' and 'Development Agreement' to 'Development Understanding', we introduce ambiguity and conflict, potentially leading to disputes over interpretation. This is because 'understanding' is less formal and legally binding than 'agreement'.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Bioamber now desires to amend the Development Agreement to allow Bioamber to fund a research project being conducted by  the Biotechnology Research Institute (\"BRI\"), which involves the molecular re-engineering of a Methylotroph owned by BRI and the development  of a lab scale fermentation design for using the re-engineered Methylotroph to make succinic acid or salts thereof from a methanol feedstock (the  \"BRI Project\"). The BRI Project will be co-funded by funds available from the Canadian National Research Council;",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Bioamber now considers modifying the Development Agreement to allow Bioamber to informally support a scientific study being run by the Biotechnology Research Institute (\"BRI\"), which considers the molecular tweaking of a Methylotroph held by BRI and the suggestion of a small scale fermentation plan for using the re-engineered Methylotroph to create succinic acid or salts thereof from a methanol feedstock (the \"BRI Project\"). The BRI Project might be co-funded by funds unofficially offered from the Canadian National Research Council;",
                "explanation": "Changing the terms 'amend', 'fund', 'research project', 're-engineering', 'development', 'design', and 'co-funded' to 'modifying', 'informally support', 'scientific study', 'tweaking', 'suggestion', 'plan', and 'might be co-funded' respectively weakens the legal obligations and creates ambiguity. 'Informally support' is not a defined financial commitment, 'scientific study' is vague compared to research project, and 'tweaking' is not a recognized scientific term. This could lead to disputes regarding the extent of Bioamber's financial and operational commitments.",

                "original_text": "Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.",
                "changed_text": "Bioamber will attempt to seek some sort of permission for the use of the CB1 Strain in certain countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber licensee are using a different strain for the making of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Furthermore, Bioamber will consider expanding the CB1 Strain and fermentation processes utilizing the CB1 Strain.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals' with 'will attempt to seek some sort of permission' significantly weakens the obligation. The term 'best efforts' is a commonly understood legal standard, while 'attempt to seek some sort of permission' is vague and does not define the level of effort required. Similarly, 'scale up' has a specific technical meaning in the context of chemical production, whereas 'consider expanding' is much less precise. This creates uncertainty regarding Bioamber's actual responsibilities and could lead to disputes over breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "XSPA shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to display, market, promote, offer for sale and sell the Products set forth on Exhibit A in all Stores throughout the Territory. The Products shall only be sold by XSPA at the retail price of the applicable Product as set forth on Exhibit A (the \"Retail Price\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory (i) may only be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties, and (ii) does not include any discounts, promotions or applicable sales taxes.",
                "changed_text": "XSPA will make suggestions for the display, marketing, promotion, offer for sale and sale of the Products listed in Exhibit A in some Stores in the Territory. The Products will be sold by XSPA, and the price will align with any prices that XSPA sees fit. For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Price for the Products at the Stores in the Territory (i) can be modified unilaterally by XSPA, and (ii) may include discounts, promotions or applicable sales taxes at XSPA's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The term \"commercially reasonable efforts\" and \"Retail Price\" have been changed to give XSPA sole discretion in the sale of products. This contradicts standard commercial practices requiring mutual agreement on price changes and a reasonable effort to sell products, leading to ambiguity and potentially undermining the contract's enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "Throughout the Term, Calm nor any of its affiliates may sell, offer for sale, market or promote any digital meditation or digital sleep products in any retail location located in an airport without the express prior written consent of XSPA. There is no clause after the expiration or termination of this agreement to cover it.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause \"and for a period of six (6) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement\", we are in direct contradiction with common business practices that include terms and clauses after the agreement termination. This creates issues for the protection of both parties' financial interests.",

                "explanation": "The modification is in direct conflict to Commercial Arbitration Rules, because it would now be done between Edward Jankowski of XpresSpa Group, Inc. and Michael Acton Smith of Calm.com, Inc, meaning that it does not follow the standard procedure to use a neutral and fair person that is not involved. The process of doing this is now very subjective and not fair.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the Investor Group is deemed to beneficially own shares of the Common Stock totaling, in the aggregate, 4,425,000 shares of the Common Stock outstanding as of the date hereof; and",

                "explanation": "Changing “is deemed to beneficially own” to “may be thought to possess” significantly weakens the assertion of ownership. The term 'beneficially own' has a specific legal meaning under SEC rules, while “may be thought to possess” is vague and creates uncertainty about the actual level of control and ownership held by the Investor Group.",

                "original_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the terms \"Affiliate\" and \"Associate\" shall have the respective meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act; the terms \"beneficial owner\" and \"beneficial ownership\" shall have the same meanings as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act; the terms \"economic owner\" and \"economically own\" shall have the same meanings as \"beneficial owner\" and \"beneficially own,\" except that a person will also be deemed to economically own and to be the economic owner of (i) all shares of Common Stock which such person has the right to acquire pursuant to the exercise of any rights in connection with any securities or any agreement, regardless of when such rights may be exercised and whether they are conditional, and (ii) all shares of Common Stock in which such person has any economic interest, including, without limitation, pursuant to a cash settled call option or other derivative security, contract or instrument in any way related to the price of shares of Common Stock; the terms \"person\" or \"persons\" shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization or other entity of any kind or nature; and the term \"Related Person\" shall mean, as to any person, any Affiliates or Associates of such person.",
                "changed_text": "(d) As used in this Agreement, the terms \"Affiliate\" and \"Associate\" shall be interpreted according to common business usage; the terms \"beneficial owner\" and \"beneficial ownership\" shall mean having some influence over stock decisions; the terms \"economic owner\" and \"economically own\" shall loosely correspond to \"beneficial owner\" and \"beneficially own,\" but excludes shares that may be acquired in the future; the terms \"person\" or \"persons\" shall generally mean humans; and the term \"Related Person\" shall mean family.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the standard legal definitions with vague, non-legal definitions directly contradicts established securities law and corporate governance principles. Using \"common business usage\" for 'Affiliate' and 'Associate,' defining 'beneficial owner' as 'having some influence,' excluding future shares from 'economic owner,' defining 'person' as 'humans', and defining 'Related Person' as 'family' are all misalignments. This introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement uncertain because the contract now relies on subjective interpretations rather than objective legal standards.",

                "original_text": "10. Specific Performance. Each of the Investors, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury to the other party hereto may occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached and that such injury would not be adequately compensable in monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the Investors or any Investor, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (the \"Moving Party\"), shall each be entitled to seek specific enforcement of, and injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent any violation of, the terms hereof, and the other party hereto will not take action, directly or indirectly, in opposition to the Moving Party seeking such relief on the grounds that any other remedy or relief is available at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "10. Specific Performance. Each of the Investors, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, acknowledges that damages might occur if terms are not met. It is agreed that either party can ask a court for help, but only if they really, really need it.",
                "explanation": "Replacing legally precise language with casual, subjective language undermines the enforceability of the specific performance clause. The original clause explicitly acknowledges 'irreparable injury' and the inadequacy of monetary damages, which are key elements for obtaining specific performance. The altered language is vague and introduces uncertainty about when specific performance would be appropriate, potentially preventing a party from obtaining equitable relief.",

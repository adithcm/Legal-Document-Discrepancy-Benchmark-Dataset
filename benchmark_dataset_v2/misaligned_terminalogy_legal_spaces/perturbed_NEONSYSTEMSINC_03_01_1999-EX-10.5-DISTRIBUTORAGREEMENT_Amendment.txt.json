In the event that the term           hereof extends beyond Licensee's fiscal year beginning April 1, 2003,           the amount of the Annual Royalty Advance shall increase by $1,000,000           for each such fiscal year thereafter.",

In the event that the term           hereof extends beyond Licensee's fiscal year beginning April 1, 2003,           the amount of the Annual Royalty Obligation shall be unilaterally determined by Licensor for each such fiscal year thereafter.",
                "explanation": "The original term 'Annual Royalty Advance Requirement' creates a specific obligation. Changing it to 'Annual Royalty Obligation' and giving Licensor the power of unilateral determination introduces ambiguity. This undermines the concept of a pre-agreed amount, potentially contradicting contract law principles of mutual agreement and good faith.",

Thereafter, the term \"Consideration Percentage\" shall           mean a percentage to be determined based on market conditions (i) a rate which the Licensor deems reasonable from and after the first day of each           quarter of each fiscal year of Licensee\n\n          commencing with Licensee's fiscal year beginning April 1, 1999) until           such time, if any, during such quarter that the aggregate amount of           all payments outstanding as of the first day of such quarter           (including the amount payable on such first day) has been           credited against earnings (a \"Satisfaction Date\"),           and (ii) a lower percentage to be determined from and after a Satisfaction Date           through and including the last day of the fiscal quarter in which such           Satisfaction Date occurs.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"Specified Royalty Percentage\" with \"Consideration Percentage\" allows Licensor to subjectively adjust the rate. This contradicts the original intent of a fixed, contractually defined percentage, creating uncertainty and potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing. By changing the term, the Licensee will lose a legal argument on a breach of contract.",

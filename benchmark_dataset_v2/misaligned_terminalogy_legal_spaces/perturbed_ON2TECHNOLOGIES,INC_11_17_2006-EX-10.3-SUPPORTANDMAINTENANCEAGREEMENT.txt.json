The defect must be caused by the Flix Software in the form provided by Wildform as a Deliverable.",
                "changed_text": "1.13 \"Program Errors\" means any glitch in the Flix Software that 1) may cause slight data inconvenience on a user's system, 2) causes the Flix Software to exhibit unexpected behavior, 3) creates minor user experience difficulties, or 4) might potentially affect other programs. The glitch may be in the Flix Software regardless of its origin.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Program Errors\" is changed to be significantly more vague and subjective. The original definition provided specific, objectively measurable criteria (data loss/corruption, system instability, etc.). The modified definition uses terms like \"slight data inconvenience,\" \"unexpected behavior,\" and \"minor user experience difficulties,\" which are open to interpretation. It removes the requirement that the error be caused by Wildform's deliverable.",

Customer Pre-Purchase Inquiries During the first twelve (12) months of the Term, Wildform will provide On2 via email during Wildform's normal business hours reasonable technical support for customer pre-purchase inquiries received by On2, including the following:\n\n      o     During the first thirty (30) days of the Term, Wildform will respond             to customer pre-purchase email inquiries. The foregoing support will             be provided as follows: (i) customer shall be directed to send             technical support emails will be sent to On2; (ii) On2 shall forward             such emails to Wildform; (iii) Wildform shall respond to On2 within             24 hours, except for holidays and weekends; and (iv) On2 will, in             turn, respond to the customer.\n\n      o     For the remaining eleven (11) months of the Term, On2 may send             customer pre-purchase inquiries via email to Wildform and Wildform             shall respond within 48 hours, except for holidays and weekends.",
                "changed_text": "4. Customer Pre-Purchase Inquiries During the first twelve (12) months of the Term, Wildform will provide On2 email assistance, during Wildform's preferred business hours, for customer pre-purchase suggestions received by On2, possibly including the following:\n\n      o     During the first thirty (30) days of the Term, Wildform may sometimes respond             to customer pre-purchase email suggestions. The foregoing support may             be provided as follows: (i) customer might be asked to send             general questions to On2; (ii) On2 can possibly forward             such emails to Wildform; (iii) Wildform should try to respond to On2 within             24-72 hours, except for holidays and weekends; and (iv) On2 will, in             turn, respond to the customer whenever possible.\n\n      o     For the remaining eleven (11) months of the Term, On2 can possibly send             customer pre-purchase inquiries via email to Wildform and Wildform             will try to respond within a reasonable time, taking holidays and weekends into consideration.",
                "explanation": "The original section committed Wildform to providing \"reasonable technical support.\" The modified section uses language that makes Wildform's obligations discretionary and ill-defined. Terms such as \"email assistance,\" \"preferred business hours,\" \"suggestions,\" \"may sometimes respond,\" \"might be asked,\" \"can possibly forward,\" \"should try to respond,\" and \"whenever possible\" significantly weaken Wildform's commitment. Instead of 24-48 hours, there is now a potential range of 24-72 hours for the first 30 days.",

Subject to payment by On2 of the Closing Date Payment Amount in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Wildform shall deliver each Deliverable in accordance with the timeframe (the \"Timeframe\") set forth in Exhibit B, which Exhibit is made a part of this Agreement. On2 will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wildform as necessary in completing the Development Work and delivery of the Deliverables. Upon receipt of each Deliverable, On2 shall have a period of thirty (30) working days within which to inspect such Deliverable based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\"). Should On2 find that any Deliverable does not substantially conform to the relevant Specification, On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing, which notice shall provide sufficiently detailed explanation of the non-conformities so as to allow Wildform to reproduce them (any such notice is referred to herein as a \"Nonconformance Notice\"). Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 Deliverables. Subject to payment by On2 of the Closing Date Payment Amount in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, Wildform will attempt to provide each Deliverable loosely based on a general timeframe that might be in Exhibit B. On2 will consider helping Wildform as it sees fit in hopefully completing the Development Work and possible delivery of some Deliverables. After perhaps getting a Deliverable, On2 might have some time to look at such Deliverable. If On2 feels the Deliverable is somewhat different from what was expected, On2 could maybe notify Wildform. Each of the Deliverables shall perhaps be considered accepted by On2 unless On2 sends Wildform something that might be a Nonconformance Notice sometime after receiving such Deliverable.",
                "explanation": "The language has been altered to remove any firm obligations on Wildform's part regarding the delivery of the deliverables according to the specified timeframe. The use of subjective words such as \"attempt,\" \"loosely based,\" \"might be,\" \"consider helping,\" \"hopefully completing,\" \"possible delivery,\" \"perhaps getting,\" \"might have some time,\" \"feels,\" \"somewhat different,\" \"could maybe,\" \"perhaps be considered,\" and \"sometime after\" transform the original commitments into vague possibilities. The deletion of specific timelines and acceptance criteria creates a situation where it is difficult to determine if Wildform has breached the contract. The requirement of 'sufficiently detailed explanation' has been removed, making the process even more nebulous.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; Lack of Definite Terms - The modified language is so vague and discretionary that it undermines the core purpose of a contract: to establish clear, enforceable obligations.",

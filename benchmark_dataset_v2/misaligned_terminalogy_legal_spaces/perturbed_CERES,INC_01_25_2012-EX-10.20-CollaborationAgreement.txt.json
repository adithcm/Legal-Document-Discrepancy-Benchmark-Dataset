                "original_text": "4.1 “JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY” shall mean (a) all patentable inventions conceived, discovered, developed and/or reduced to practice (i)  jointly by one or more employees, agents, or students of CERES and by one or more employees, agents, or students of IGER in the performance of  any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) or (ii) by one or more employees, agents or students of IGER in the performance of any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) to  the extent CERES provides a financial contribution for such RESEARCH PROJECT, which is not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of either the  overall cost of such RESEARCH PROJECT or of the activity during which the invention was made, unless expressly provided otherwise in a  SCHEDULE; (b) patents, patent applications, plant variety rights, plant variety right applications, reissues, continuations, continuations-in-part  and divisionals claiming such patentable inventions in any country of the world; (c) all trade secrets and copyrighted works created jointly by one  or more employees, agents, or students of CERES and by one or more employees, agents, or students of IGER in the performance of any  RESEARCH PROJECT(S); and (d) all germplasm and plant varieties created in the performance of plant breeding activities in the performance of  any RESEARCH PROJECT(S).",
                "changed_text": "4.1 “JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY” shall mean (a) all creations, innovations, and concepts generally understood to be beneficial to both CERES and IGER irrespective of patentability, conceived, discovered, developed and/or reduced to practice (i) jointly by one or more employees, agents, or students of CERES and by one or more employees, agents, or students of IGER in the performance of  any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) or (ii) by one or more employees, agents or students of IGER in the performance of any RESEARCH PROJECT(S) regardless of CERES financial contribution. (b) patents, patent applications, plant variety rights, plant variety right applications, reissues, continuations, continuations-in-part  and divisionals claiming such patentable inventions in any country of the world; (c) all trade secrets and copyrighted works created jointly by one  or more employees, agents, or students of CERES and by one or more employees, agents, or students of IGER in the performance of any  RESEARCH PROJECT(S); and (d) all germplasm and plant varieties created in the performance of plant breeding activities in the performance of  any RESEARCH PROJECT(S).",
                "explanation": "The definition of Joint Intellectual Property has been changed so that it directly conflicts with standard definitions of intellectual property law. The clause 'irrespective of patentability' undermines the definition of intellectual property, which typically hinges on meeting patentability criteria. Additionally, removing the minimum financial contribution threshold from CERES creates ambiguity and contradicts standard practices where contributions often determine ownership.",

Any commercialization (including, but not limited to, the grant of  commercialization licenses) of JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS shall result in CERES paying IGER a  reasonable remuneration (whether as a royalty or in some other form as the Parties may agree) to be negotiated in good faith. The terms for  remuneration will be specified, with respect to specific RESEARCH PROJECTS, JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER  RESEARCH RESULTS, either in the respective SCHEDULES or in other agreements to be executed by the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "5.3.1 Subject to Articles 5.1 and 5.2, the Parties acknowledge and agree that CERES shall have the exclusive right, with the right to grant  sublicenses to this right, to optionally use and commercially exploit JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (including but not limited to RELEASED  VARIETIES) and OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS for some uses and fields, including, but not limited to, use in the COLLABORATION  CROPS and crops other than the COLLABORATION CROPS. Any commercialization (including, but not limited to, the grant of  commercialization licenses) of JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS may result in CERES considering paying IGER some form of compensation, as CERES sees fit. The method for  remuneration can be specified, with respect to specific RESEARCH PROJECTS, JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER  RESEARCH RESULTS, at CERES discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty and contradicts the intent of establishing clear rights for IGER. By stating 'optionally use' and 'may result in CERES considering,' the obligation for CERES to utilize and compensate IGER for joint IP is weakened. The phrase 'as CERES sees fit' grants CERES broad discretionary power over compensation, undermining the fairness and enforceability of the agreement.",

Confidential Information shall only be made accessible to each Party's  employees or students on a need-to-know basis and not to any third party, subject to Articles 7.3 and 7.4. Manuscripts and papers published in  scientific journals and presentations made at public meetings that include Confidential Information are exempt from the confidentiality obligations  of this Article, provided the Parties followed the procedure set forth in Article 8.",

Confidential Information shall only be made accessible to each Party's  employees or students on a suggested need-to-know basis and potentially to a third party, subject to Articles 7.3 and 7.4. Manuscripts and papers published in  scientific journals and presentations made at public meetings that include Confidential Information are exempt from the confidentiality obligations  of this Article, whether or not the Parties followed the procedure set forth in Article 8.",
                "explanation": "The modified text uses vague language that undermines the enforceability of the confidentiality clause. Replacing a 'period of five (5) years' with 'flexible amount of time' and a 'prior written consent' with 'attempting to obtain the disclosing party's good faith wishes' renders the obligations subjective and unenforceable. Further, the addition of 'potentially to a third party' contradicts the promise of confidentiality. Finally, the phrase 'whether or not the Parties followed the procedure set forth in Article 8' eliminates all obligation to adhere to agreed upon publishing guidelines.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contradicts standard contract law principles requiring clarity and definiteness of terms, and may render the confidentiality agreement unenforceable. Could also violate trade secret laws by failing to adequately protect confidential information.",

Theismann\"), nicknames, initials,  autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, image, likeness, voice, video portrayals, biographical data, character, symbols, and/or other  endorsement, and any variations or deviations thereof.",
                "changed_text": "\"Property\" as stated herein shall mean Theismann's general persona and any content he creates on behalf of Bizzingo.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Property' is very specific and includes legally protectable items such as name, likeness, and voice, all of which have defined protections. The revised definition of 'general persona and any content he creates' is vague and doesn't align with established intellectual property law, potentially jeopardizing Theismann's rights under right of publicity statutes.",

                "original_text": "Theismann's performance of services for Bizzingo hereunder is in his or her capacity as an independent  contractor. Accordingly, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as establishing an employer/employee, a partnership, or a joint  venture relationship between Theismann and Bizzingo.",
                "changed_text": "Theismann is considered an independent contractor for tax purposes only. Bizzingo retains complete control over Theismann's promotional activities and messaging.",
                "explanation": "The modification contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor' under employment law. Retaining 'complete control' suggests an employer-employee relationship, which impacts liability, tax obligations, and potential benefit eligibility. This is further compounded by saying 'independent contractor for tax purposes only' which is not a valid legal definition.",

                "changed_text": "The Royalty payable under the Agreement may be altered at Bizzingo's discretion based on the company's current financial state or the performance of Theismannâ€™s endorsements.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the initially agreed-upon royalty structure, which provides warrants based on activated users. By allowing the royalty to be 'altered at Bizzingo's discretion,' the contract introduces ambiguity and contradicts securities law regarding warrant issuance which dictates a structured method, rather than a discretionary one. This undermines the established financial agreement, and any potential value it may have.",

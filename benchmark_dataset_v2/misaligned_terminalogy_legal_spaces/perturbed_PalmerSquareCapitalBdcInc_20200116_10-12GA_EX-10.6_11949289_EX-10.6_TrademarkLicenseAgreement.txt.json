                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Licensor and its affiliates, including Palmer Square BDC Advisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Investment Advisor\"), have used the marks \"Palmer Square\", \"Palmer Square Capital\" and derivations thereof (the \"Licensed Mark\") in specific parts of the United States of America and no other jurisdictions (collectively, the \"Territory\") in connection with some investment management, investment consultation and investment advisory services they provide;",
                "explanation": "The modified text limits the 'Territory' to 'specific parts' of the US and restricts the investment services to 'some' rather than all. This contradicts the original broad scope of the 'Territory' and the services covered by the Licensed Mark. Trademark rights and usage are usually defined by a specific territory, but this change introduces uncertainty regarding which parts of the US are included and what services are covered, weakening the trademark protection and contradicting standard trademark law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act) - establishes a national system for trademark protection. This modification creates ambiguity about the scope of the trademark rights.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and solely and exclusively as a component' are directly contradicted by 'general, exclusive, royalty-bearing, and separate from any connection.' This introduces substantial uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the trademark license. The original agreement limited use, while the modified text broadens it significantly, creating a legal contradiction and contradicting the initial intent.",

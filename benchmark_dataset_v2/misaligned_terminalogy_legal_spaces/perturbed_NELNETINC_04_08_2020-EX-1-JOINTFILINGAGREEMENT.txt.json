                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's perceived ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby suggest that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D should be considered as potentially filed on behalf of each of the undersigned contingent upon adherence with the spirit of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'ownership' to 'perceived ownership' and 'is being filed on behalf' to 'should be considered as potentially filed on behalf' introduces ambiguity and contradicts the explicit filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The original text clearly states a joint agreement to file, while the modified text introduces uncertainty about whether the filing is actually on behalf of each party and whether they are fully adhering to Rule 13d-1(k), leading to potential non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each might assist with the potentially timely filing of such amendments, and might strive for the reasonable accuracy of the information they provide; however, responsibility for the ultimate completeness rests at their discretion and only extends to information they directly contribute, regardless of their knowledge of inaccuracies from others.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'might assist' and 'might strive' weakens the obligation for timely filing and accurate information. Removing the responsibility for knowing about inaccuracies of others information creates a contradiction, because the initial agreement indicates shared responsibility for the filing as a whole. The modified text contradicts securities regulations that require due diligence in filings, even concerning information provided by others.",

The Company agrees that the Contractor may service renewable note programs for other issuers during the course of the Offering, but such activities shall not prevent the Contractor from promptly and efficiently performing its duties hereunder. The Contractor (and the Agency as defined in Section 3.01(b) below) may direct other issuers to advertise the securities of other issuers on websites, in print, by radio, or by any other means and at such times as they may determine; provided, however, that any such advertising which refers to the Notes shall not refer to, mention, or advertise any securities or notes of any other issuer, nor include any links to any other issuer, renewable note program or offering.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not' to 'may', this clause now contradicts securities laws, which require clear separation and distinction between different securities offerings to avoid misleading investors. This introduces ambiguity and potential violation of regulations.",

The Company shall be responsible for determining whether (i) such subscription shall be accepted, (ii) such agreement is complete and accurate in all material respects, including without limitation the execution thereof by such Investor, (iii) such Investor timely remits the proper purchase price for the Notes in accordance with the Subscription Agreement, and (iv) the principal amount, interest rate and term to maturity and any other material terms of the Notes are verified for accuracy and completeness.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall promptly forward' to 'may forward' introduces uncertainty about the contractor's obligation to submit investor subscription agreements, which is a critical function under securities regulations. This contradiction undermines transparency and regulatory compliance in investment processing.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may', the provision concerning reports becomes discretionary. This alteration can be problematic because regular reports are crucial for transparency and investor protection, as emphasized by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Diminishing this obligation creates a contradiction with standards of disclosure expected under investment agreements and regulatory oversight.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should use commercially reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation, making it potentially discretionary. Replacing 'substantially similar' with 'similar to' provides room for deviation. Replacing 'as deemed appropriate or necessary' with 'as they consider helpful' makes the decision subjective.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall have the sole responsibility' to 'will generally be responsible' introduces ambiguity regarding who ultimately bears the responsibility. Adding 'when practical' and 'when feasible' allows for subjective interpretation of when the filing and consent are required, weakening the obligation.",

                "explanation": "By changing “shall comply” to “agrees to endeavor to comply”, the obligation to adhere to import and export control laws becomes non-mandatory. The word 'endeavor' introduces a level of effort rather than a strict requirement, making compliance discretionary.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Hydron agrees to take the comments of the Dolphins into account in preparing and disseminating such disclosure, but notwithstanding comments from the Dolphins, Hydron shall make such disclosure as may be required by law.",
                "changed_text": "Hydron will consider the comments of the Dolphins in preparing and disseminating such disclosure, but notwithstanding comments from the Dolphins, Hydron may make such disclosure as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the mandatory 'shall' with the permissive 'may' and replaces 'as may be required by law' with the discretionary 'as it deems appropriate'. This weakens Hydron's obligation to comply with federal securities laws regarding disclosure, making it subjective and potentially non-compliant.",

                "changed_text": "The Dolphins may, at their discretion, advise Hydron of any development of or changes in these rules and policies.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'will advise' with 'may, at their discretion, advise', the Dolphins' obligation to inform Hydron of changes that might negatively impact the agreement becomes optional. This introduces ambiguity and could lead to Hydron being unaware of changes affecting their sponsorship rights.",

                "changed_text": "The Dolphins may attempt to reschedule any aspect of the Sponsorship Rights which is prevented from occurring as scheduled.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'in good faith' and 'at such date as may be reasonably agreeable to the Dolphins and Hydron' phrases significantly weakens the obligation. The original clause mandated a genuine effort to find a mutually agreeable date; the modified clause merely suggests a possibility of rescheduling without requiring a serious attempt or mutual agreement. This is especially problematic in light of section 8.2",

                "original_text": "Each of the parties shall indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective partners, shareholders, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") from and against any and all claims, orders, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of the other party's negligent actions or omissions with respect to this Agreement, or such party's wilful misconduct or breach of any representation, warranty or agreement in this Agreement applicable to it. Neither party shall have an obligation to indemnify or hold harmless an Indemnitees from any claim arising from or related to the Indemnitees negligence or misconduct. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other of any claim or litigation to which the indemnity set forth in this paragraph applies. Each of the parties agree to defend all actions to which such indemnity applies and to conduct the defense thereof at its expense and by qualified counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitees.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the parties will endeavor to indemnify the other, and their respective partners, shareholders, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") from claims, orders, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, potentially arising from the other party's actions related to this Agreement. Neither party automatically indemnifies the other for claims arising from the Indemnitees' negligence or misconduct. Each party should notify the other of relevant claims or litigation. Each party will consider defending actions to which this indemnity may apply, using counsel.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall indemnify and hold harmless' with 'will endeavor to indemnify,' weakening the obligation to indemnify. The removal of 'reasonable' before attorney's fees adds further ambiguity, and replacing 'Each of the parties agree to defend all actions to which such indemnity applies' with 'Each party will consider defending actions to which this indemnity may apply, using counsel.' makes the defense discretionary, conflicting with Florida's contract law principles, which expect clear and enforceable indemnity clauses.",

                "original_text": "Insurance. The Dolphins shall, at its own expense, maintain in effect throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance policies with carriers of recognized standing, with limits of liability of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), governing any and all property damage and person injury (including death) arising out of activities covered by this Agreement. Hydron shall, at its own expense, maintain in effect throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance policies with carriers of recognized standing, with limits of liability of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), covering any and all property damage and personal injury (including death) arising out of activities covered by this Agreement and shall obtain and maintain such additional insurance coverage as the Dolphins shall reasonably require with respect to any Sponsored Events or similar activities.",
                "changed_text": "Insurance. The Dolphins will aim to maintain general liability insurance policies during the agreement, with liability limits they consider adequate, covering potential damages and injuries related to this Agreement. Hydron will also seek to maintain similar insurance policies, with limits it believes are sufficient, and may obtain additional coverage if the Dolphins suggest it is beneficial for Sponsored Events.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'will aim to' weakens the obligation to maintain insurance. 'Carriers of recognized standing' and 'One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)' are replaced with 'they consider adequate' and 'it believes are sufficient,' introducing subjectivity. The obligation to 'obtain and maintain such additional insurance coverage as the Dolphins shall reasonably require' is replaced with 'may obtain additional coverage if the Dolphins suggest it is beneficial,' making it discretionary. This conflicts with standard Florida contract law, where specific insurance requirements are typically strictly enforced.",

                "original_text": "The Dolphins hereby agree, in good faith, to attempt to reschedule any aspect of the Sponsorship Rights which is prevented from occurring as scheduled, at such date as may be reasonably agreeable to the Dolphins and Hydron. If one or more events or benefits are unable to be rescheduled during the Term of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply in the same manner as if such failure to reschedule caused a termination of a Sponsorship Right.",
                "changed_text": "The Dolphins may, at their discretion, consider rescheduling aspects of the Sponsorship Rights that are prevented from occurring, potentially at a date that is convenient for both parties. If rescheduling is not feasible, the provisions of Section 8.2 might apply.",
                "explanation": "The text has been modified to create ambiguity by replacing 'The Dolphins hereby agree, in good faith, to attempt to reschedule' with 'The Dolphins may, at their discretion, consider rescheduling,' making rescheduling optional rather than an obligation. The phrase 'at such date as may be reasonably agreeable to the Dolphins and Hydron' is simplified to 'potentially at a date that is convenient for both parties,' reducing the commitment to finding a mutually agreeable date. Finally, 'the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply' is softened to 'the provisions of Section 8.2 might apply,' creating uncertainty about the consequences of failing to reschedule. This weakened language may conflict with Florida's contractual interpretation principles that focus on good faith efforts.",

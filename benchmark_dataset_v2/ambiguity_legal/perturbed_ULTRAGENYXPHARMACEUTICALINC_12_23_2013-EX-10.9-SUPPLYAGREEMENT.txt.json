                "changed_text": "Cremer will endeavor to ensure that all quantities of Product delivered under the Agreement are manufactured with consideration to GMP guidelines. The Product will be considered acceptable if it substantially aligns with the specifications outlined in Annex A.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the product 'shall be manufactured in accordance with GMP,' a strict requirement. The modified text replaces 'represents and warrants' with 'will endeavor to ensure,' weakening the guarantee. Furthermore, 'shall be free from defects' is replaced with 'will be considered acceptable if it substantially aligns,' introducing ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required. This contradicts the strict adherence to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) required by Sec. 4 para. 19 AMG (German Pharmaceuticals Act) for active pharmaceutical ingredients.",

Ultragenyx may rely on the documentation provided by Cremer and Ultragenyx will not need to independently test the Product unless Ultragenyx determines such independent testing is necessary. In the event that the Product fails to conform to the Product Specifications, and/or GMP, Ultragenyx may reject the Product by giving written notice to Cremer within [***] days after receipt of the Product and all documentation (except such [***] day period will not apply for any latent defect).",
                "changed_text": "Ultragenyx will conduct a perfunctory review of the Product. Ultragenyx may generally rely on the documentation provided by Cremer, and independent testing is at Ultragenyx's discretion. Should the Product exhibit substantial deviations from the Product Specifications, Ultragenyx may consider rejecting the Product after providing informal notification to Cremer.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines a formal process for final product release, allowing Ultragenyx to reject the product if it doesn't conform to specifications. The changed text weakens this process by replacing 'final release' with 'perfunctory review' and 'may reject' with 'may consider rejecting', making rejection optional and less definitive. The shift from 'written notice' to 'informal notification' also decreases the formality and enforceability of the rejection process. This creates ambiguity and potentially contradicts the quality control measures required under Sec. 4 para. 19 AMG (German Pharmaceuticals Act) for pharmaceutical products.",

                "original_text": "In the event of legal proceedings being instituted against Cremer by a third party arising out of Ultragenyx's development, processing and commercialization of the Product, Ultragenyx shall indemnify and keep indemnified Cremer in full against all damages, losses, injuries, costs and expenses in connection with such legal proceedings. Cremer will inform Ultragenyx about any legal proceedings being instituted against Cremer without delay. Ultragenyx shall control the respective legal proceedings but shall not settle any claim that admits fault on behalf of Cremer without Cremer's consent (not be unreasonably withheld).",
                "changed_text": "In the event of legal proceedings potentially arising against Cremer due to Ultragenyx's activities, Ultragenyx will consider providing reasonable assistance to Cremer regarding associated costs. Cremer will attempt to inform Ultragenyx about possible legal proceedings. Ultragenyx may offer input on legal proceedings, but Cremer retains ultimate control.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Ultragenyx to fully indemnify Cremer against legal proceedings. The revised text replaces 'shall indemnify and keep indemnified Cremer in full' with 'will consider providing reasonable assistance to Cremer regarding associated costs,' making the indemnification discretionary and limited. The obligation to inform 'without delay' changes to 'attempt to inform' weakening the notification duty. Replacing 'Ultragenyx shall control' with 'Ultragenyx may offer input' greatly reduces Ultragenyx's control, which, paired with Cremer having 'ultimate control', contradicts standard liability and indemnification practices and introduces ambiguity about the extent of protection Cremer receives, creating potential non-compliance with legal standards for liability allocation.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the service provider to perform the maintenance in a 'clean, safe, efficient, and environmentally reasonable manner'. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall perform' to 'shall endeavor to perform' and 'maintain the SEF in good operating and mechanical condition' to 'maintain the SEF in reasonably good operating and mechanical condition'. The terms 'endeavor', 'generally' and 'reasonably good' are vague and open to interpretation, making it harder to enforce specific standards.",

The ambiguous language weakens the requirement for maintaining a safe environment, potentially contradicting this regulation.",

Service Provider shall identify, procure, obtain, maintain and comply with all permits that may be required under applicable laws for or  in connection with the performance of Services (and Non-Covered Services as actually provided by Service Provider) and that need to be  procured, obtained and maintained by or in the name of Service Provider. Owner shall provide Service Provider with such assistance and  cooperation as may reasonably be required in order to obtain and maintain all such Permits.

Owner shall provide Service Provider with assistance and  cooperation as deemed necessary in order to obtain and maintain some of such Permits. Service Provider may submit copies of applications  for, and proposed forms of, all such Permits to Owner when feasible, for Owner's review and approval.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall identify, procure, obtain, maintain and comply' to 'shall attempt to identify, procure, obtain, maintain and comply with most permits'. The terms 'attempt' and 'most' are vague, suggesting that not all permits will necessarily be obtained. Also, replacing 'as may reasonably be required' to 'as deemed necessary' weakens the cooperation needed to obtain the permits. Changing 'Service Provider shall submit copies of applications' to 'Service Provider may submit copies of applications' makes the application process vague.",

If requested, Service Provider shall provide to Owner  evidence of the competence of such personnel including details of their previous experience and qualifications. If Owner or User reasonably  determines an employee of Service Provider to be under-qualified, disruptive, non-cooperative or otherwise undesirable at the Premises, Owner or  User may request the immediate removal of such employee from the Premises for any existing or future delivery of the Services and the replacement  of such employee with a different employee of Service Provider; provided that Owner or User, as the case may be, will use commercially reasonable  efforts to provide reasonable notice to Service Provider of the need for such proposed removal.",

The original text makes personnel standards mandatory and easily enforceable while the modified text makes it ambiguous. Also, by changing 'may request the immediate removal' to 'may suggest the gradual removal' it contradicts the need for instant action.",

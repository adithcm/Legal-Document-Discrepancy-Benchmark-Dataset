                "original_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor may not always be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any direct duties with respect to the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor necessarily have any direct responsibility with respect to functions assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not be deemed' to 'may not always be deemed' and 'shall not have any responsibility' to 'shall not necessarily have any direct responsibility,' the obligation of the Sponsor is weakened, creating ambiguity regarding their responsibility. This could conflict with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires a clear assignment of responsibilities for the management and oversight of investment companies.",

                "original_text": "Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons; provided, however, that Domini shall not enter into any such subcontract unless the Trustees of the Trust shall have found the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that, unless the Trust otherwise expressly agrees in writing, Domini shall be as fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor as it would be for its own acts or omissions.",
                "changed_text": "Domini may consider subcontracting for the performance of some of Domini's obligations hereunder with one or more persons; provided, however, that Domini will try to ensure the Trustees of the Trust are generally comfortable with the subcontracting party's apparent qualifications to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that Domini will endeavor to be responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces significant ambiguity. Replacing 'may subcontract' with 'may consider subcontracting' makes the action discretionary. 'Shall have found the subcontracting party to be qualified' is weakened to 'will try to ensure the Trustees of the Trust are generally comfortable with the subcontracting party's apparent qualifications.' 'Shall be as fully responsible' is replaced with 'will endeavor to be responsible,' weakening Domini's liability. This can lead to non-compliance, and could conflict with general principles requiring clear accountability in contractual relationships, potentially violating fiduciary duties under Massachusetts law.",

This Agreement might be construed and enforced, potentially, in accordance with the general principles of law that the parties may find applicable.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to perform such further actions' to 'should consider performing such further actions', the binding nature of the clause is weakened. Replacing 'shall be construed and enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' with 'might be construed and enforced, potentially, in accordance with the general principles of law that the parties may find applicable,' removes the definite choice of Massachusetts law and introduces uncertainty about the governing law. This contradicts standard contract law practices that require a clear choice of law, potentially creating enforceability issues under Massachusetts law or conflicting legal precedents.",

                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, SpinRecords.com shall use reasonable commercial efforts to market the NETTAXI Brand Features in order to maximize the number of visitors to the NETTAXI Pages in accordance with the Statement of Work. The parties shall review the Statement of Work and NETTAXI's marketing activities on a quarterly basis in order to assess the performance and agree upon additional activities, if necessary, in order to increase usage of the pages.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, SpinRecords.com may, at its discretion, use commercial efforts to market the NETTAXI Brand Features in order to potentially increase the number of visitors to the NETTAXI Pages in general accordance with the Statement of Work. The parties might review the Statement of Work and NETTAXI's marketing activities periodically, as they see fit, to vaguely assess the performance and possibly agree upon some activities, if convenient, in order to perhaps influence usage of the pages.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall use reasonable commercial efforts' with 'may, at its discretion, use commercial efforts' makes the marketing obligation optional. The phrase 'potentially increase' weakens the objective, and 'general accordance' makes compliance with the Statement of Work vague. Changing 'shall review...on a quarterly basis' to 'might review...periodically, as they see fit' removes the mandatory quarterly review. Replacing 'agree upon additional activities, if necessary' with 'possibly agree upon some activities, if convenient' makes any further action optional. Replacing 'in order to increase' with 'in order to perhaps influence' makes increasing the page views optional. This creates ambiguity about the level of marketing effort required, leading to a potential breach of contract if SpinRecords.com does little to no marketing. Under California law, contracts are interpreted based on the parties' mutual intent, and these ambiguous phrases make it difficult to determine the original intent regarding marketing obligations.",

Upon reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days, but in no event more than once per year (unless the immediately preceding audit showed a material underpayment), NETTAXI shall have the right, subject to suitable confidentiality measures, to cause a certified public accountant to inspect those portions of the books of account and records which relate to the royalties owed NETTAXI, to confirm that the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid.",
                "changed_text": "SpinRecords.com will aim to maintain what it considers appropriate records at its principal place of business covering Advertising Revenues and commissions, subject to internal policies. NETTAXI may request, with what it deems reasonable notice, an audit—potentially more than once per year regardless of prior audit results—allowing NETTAXI to inspect the financial records. However, SpinRecords.com reserves the right to determine confidentiality measures and the scope of the certified public accountant's review, so it’s not guaranteed that it can be used to confirm the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity into the auditing rights and record-keeping obligations. Replacing 'agrees to keep accurate books' with 'will aim to maintain what it considers appropriate records' weakens the obligation and makes it subjective. Removing 'reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days' and 'but in no event more than once per year (unless the immediately preceding audit showed a material underpayment)' and replacing it with “what it deems reasonable notice, an audit—potentially more than once per year regardless of prior audit results” makes the notice period and frequency of audits uncertain and dependent on NETTAXI, but allowing Spinrecords flexibility in restricting the records and using confidentality measures it deems proper. The addition of “so it’s not guaranteed that it can be used to confirm the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid” removes the guarantee that the inspection can be used to verify royalty payments. The lack of clarity and weakened obligations may conflict with California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and fairly in the performance of a contract.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the provision for attorneys' fees and costs. Replacing 'shall be entitled to' with 'may be considered for' makes the recovery of fees discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding 'possibly arising out of' introduces uncertainty about the scope of actions covered. The phrase 'some reimbursement' reduces the amount recoverable and 'depending on the circumstances' creates ambiguity and discretion for reimbursement. This directly contradicts California law which provides for attorneys fees for the prevailing party.",

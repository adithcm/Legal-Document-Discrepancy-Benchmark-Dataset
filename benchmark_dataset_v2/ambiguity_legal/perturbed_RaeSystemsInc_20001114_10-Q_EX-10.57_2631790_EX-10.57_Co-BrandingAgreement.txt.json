                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, SpinRecords.com shall use reasonable commercial efforts to market the NETTAXI Brand Features in order to maximize the number of visitors to the NETTAXI Pages in accordance with the Statement of Work. The parties shall review the Statement of Work and NETTAXI's marketing activities on a quarterly basis in order to assess the performance and agree upon additional activities, if necessary, in order to increase usage of the pages.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, SpinRecords.com should endeavor to market the NETTAXI Brand Features in order to increase the number of visitors to the NETTAXI Pages. The parties may review the Statement of Work and NETTAXI's marketing activities periodically, if they choose to, in order to generally assess the performance and consider additional activities to potentially increase usage of the pages.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use reasonable commercial efforts' to 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation, making it less enforceable. Replacing 'shall review...on a quarterly basis' with 'may review...periodically, if they choose to' makes the review process discretionary, rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity, undermining the original intent of active, regular marketing collaboration.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles under California law, which require clear and definite obligations for enforceability. This perturbation introduces vagueness, making it difficult to prove a breach.",

                "original_text": "SpinRecords.com agrees to keep accurate books of account and records at its principal place of business covering all Advertising Revenues and associated commissions. Upon reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days, but in no event more than once per year (unless the immediately preceding audit showed a material underpayment), NETTAXI shall have the right, subject to suitable confidentiality measures, to cause a certified public accountant to inspect those portions of the books of account and records which relate to the royalties owed NETTAXI, to confirm that the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid. SpinRecords.com shall maintain such books of account and records which support each statement for at least two years after the termination or expiration of this contract or after the final payment made by SpinRecords.com to NETTAXI, whichever is later.",
                "changed_text": "SpinRecords.com agrees to maintain records of Advertising Revenues. Upon what SpinRecords.com considers to be reasonable notice, NETTAXI may have the option, subject to confidentiality measures, to request an inspection of records related to royalties owed. SpinRecords.com will keep records it deems necessary for a reasonable period after the contract's termination.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'accurate books of account' with 'maintain records,' and removes 'at its principal place of business', making the requirement vague. Replacing 'reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days' with 'what SpinRecords.com considers to be reasonable notice' gives SpinRecords.com subjective control. Changing 'shall have the right...to cause a certified public accountant to inspect' to 'may have the option to request an inspection' makes the audit discretionary, not a right. Replacing the specified 'two years' record retention with a 'reasonable period' introduces more ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "California contract law requires specificity in record-keeping and audit provisions. The modified text's ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce audit rights, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in California contracts.",

                "changed_text": "In addition to any other relief awarded, the prevailing party in any action arising out of this Agreement may be considered for reimbursement of its attorneys' fees and costs, at the court's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be entitled' to 'may be considered' makes the recovery of attorneys' fees discretionary rather than a right. Adding 'at the court's discretion' further reinforces this ambiguity, weakening the prevailing party's position and introducing uncertainty about cost recovery.",
                "contradicted_law": "While California law allows for attorneys' fees clauses, making the award discretionary contradicts the contractual intention to provide a clear remedy to the prevailing party, undermining the predictability and enforceability of the provision.",

                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, SpinRecords.com shall use reasonable commercial efforts to market the NETTAXI Brand Features in order to maximize the number of visitors to the NETTAXI Pages in accordance with the Statement of Work. The parties shall review the Statement of Work and NETTAXI's marketing activities on a quarterly basis in order to assess the performance and agree upon additional activities, if necessary, in order to increase usage of the pages.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, SpinRecords.com may consider marketing the NETTAXI Brand Features in order to potentially increase the number of visitors to the NETTAXI Pages, subject to resource availability. The parties might, at their convenience, review the Statement of Work and NETTAXI's marketing activities on an occasional basis, and may discuss additional activities, if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states an obligation for SpinRecords.com to use 'reasonable commercial efforts' for marketing. The modified text weakens this obligation significantly by using terms like 'may consider,' 'potentially increase,' 'subject to resource availability,' 'might, at their convenience,' and 'if deemed appropriate,' making the marketing effort discretionary. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about the level of marketing effort required, conflicting with typical contract law expectations of good faith and reasonable performance.",

Upon reasonable notice of not less than seven (7) business days, but in no event more than once per year (unless the immediately preceding audit showed a material underpayment), NETTAXI shall have the right, subject to suitable confidentiality measures, to cause a certified public accountant to inspect those portions of the books of account and records which relate to the royalties owed NETTAXI, to confirm that the correct amount owing NETTAXI under this Agreement has been paid. SpinRecords.com shall maintain such books of account and records which support each statement for at least two years after the termination or expiration of this contract or after the final payment made by SpinRecords.com to NETTAXI, whichever is later.",
                "changed_text": "SpinRecords.com will endeavor to maintain records related to Advertising Revenues and associated commissions. NETTAXI may, with advance notification, request a review of relevant records, the scope and frequency of which will be mutually agreed upon. SpinRecords.com will retain records as it deems necessary for its own internal purposes.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for SpinRecords.com to keep 'accurate books of account and records' and specifies NETTAXI's audit rights. The modified text weakens this by using 'will endeavor to maintain records,' making the accuracy requirement vague. It also makes NETTAXI's audit rights subject to 'mutually agreed upon' scope and frequency, giving SpinRecords.com significant control over the audit process. The record retention period is also changed to 'as it deems necessary for its own internal purposes', making it indefinite and unenforceable. This change contradicts generally accepted accounting principles and standards, potentially making it difficult to verify payments owed to NETTAXI.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear financial obligation for SpinRecords.com to reimburse NETTAXI's audit expenses if a shortfall exceeding 5% is discovered. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity and discretion. 'Suggests a potential discrepancy' is vague compared to 'discloses a shortfall.' Replacing 'agrees to pay or reimburse' with 'may discuss the possibility of contributing' makes reimbursement discretionary. Finally, 'as deemed equitable' further weakens the obligation by adding subjective criteria. This contradicts the principle of contractual certainty and makes the reimbursement clause effectively unenforceable.",

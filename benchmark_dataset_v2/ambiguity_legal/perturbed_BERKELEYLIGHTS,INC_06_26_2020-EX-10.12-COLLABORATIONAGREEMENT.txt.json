                "original_text": "Each Party will undertake this Agreement in furtherance of the Purpose and under the guidance of the JRC pursuant to Article 3 (Joint Review Committee). During the Term, each Party will use diligent efforts to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under and in accordance with (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan in accordance with the timelines set forth in such Workflow Development Plan. Each Party will reasonably cooperate with each other in the performance of their responsibilities under this Agreement and each Workflow Development Plan, including (i) responding to reasonable requests by the other Party submitted in accordance with this Agreement to provide information reasonably necessary for the performance of such requesting Party's obligations under this Agreement (including any Workflow Development Plan) and (ii) causing its personnel, agents and representatives, while at the other Party's facility, to abide by the written work rules and facility regulations applicable to such facility as provided in advance by such other Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to undertake this Agreement in furtherance of the Purpose and generally under the guidance of the JRC pursuant to Article 3 (Joint Review Committee). During the Term, each Party will attempt to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under and in general accordance with (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan in alignment with the timelines set forth in such Workflow Development Plan. Each Party will consider cooperating with each other in the performance of their responsibilities under this Agreement and each Workflow Development Plan, including (i) responding to relevant requests by the other Party submitted in accordance with this Agreement to provide information reasonably helpful for the performance of such requesting Party's obligations under this Agreement (including any Workflow Development Plan) and (ii) encouraging its personnel, agents and representatives, while at the other Party's facility, to be mindful of the work rules and facility regulations applicable to such facility as provided in advance by such other Party.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligations by replacing 'will undertake' with 'will endeavor to undertake,' 'will use diligent efforts' with 'will attempt to implement and perform,' 'in accordance with' with 'in general accordance with,' 'will reasonably cooperate' with 'will consider cooperating,' 'reasonably necessary' with 'reasonably helpful,' and 'to abide by' with 'to be mindful of.' These modifications create ambiguities and reduce the enforceability of the obligations. The original text suggests a binding agreement, while the altered language implies goals and suggestions. This introduces ambiguity, leading to potential disputes and non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles require clear and definite obligations. The modified language creates uncertainty about the level of effort required, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law, the state where both companies are incorporated. Specifics vary but generally state that 'endeavor' is not as compelling as 'shall' or 'will' and 'consider' does not require that a party actually cooperate.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall have the right, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to inspect all such records of the other Party, its Affiliates or Permitted Subcontractors. The reviewing Party shall be responsible for all costs of the inspection but shall have no right to copy or retain records. All disclosed records and the information disclosed therein shall be treated as Confidential Information in accordance with Article 10 (Confidentiality).",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may have the option, during possible business hours and with potential notice, to consider inspecting such records of the other Party, its Affiliates or Permitted Subcontractors. The reviewing Party might be responsible for some costs of a possible inspection and should not generally copy or retain records. Any potentially disclosed records may be considered Confidential Information in accordance with Article 10 (Confidentiality).",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall have the right' with 'may have the option' makes the right discretionary rather than mandatory. Changing 'during normal business hours' to 'during possible business hours' and 'upon reasonable notice' to 'with potential notice' introduces vagueness about the conditions of inspection. Using 'might be responsible' instead of 'shall be responsible' makes the cost allocation uncertain. Replacing 'shall be treated' with 'may be considered' weakens the obligation to treat disclosed records as confidential. This makes the entire clause open to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "The original clause allows both parties to check and verify the records, which are considered business ethics. This clause may conflict with Delaware’s ‘duty of good faith,’ which expects parties to clearly define obligations. The added vagueness could be argued as a breach of this duty if an auditing partner is harmed by lack of transparency in the other partner’s financial documents.",

                "original_text": "With respect to Beacon Optofluidic Machines (including related Hardware and Software), Consumables and Services for which Ginkgo has placed a Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement, the Parties agree to the BLI Terms and Conditions that apply with respect to Beacon Optofluidic Machines (including related Hardware and Software), Consumables and Services, unless, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the BLI Terms and Conditions (including any language regarding the treatment of additional or different terms set forth therein), a term in such BLI Terms and Conditions is inconsistent with a term in this Agreement, in which case this Agreement shall control, including as follows:",
                "changed_text": "Regarding Beacon Optofluidic Machines (including related Hardware and Software), Consumables, and Services for which Ginkgo has potentially placed a Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement, the Parties may consider the BLI Terms and Conditions that could apply with respect to Beacon Optofluidic Machines (including related Hardware and Software), Consumables, and Services. However, potentially notwithstanding some items to the contrary set forth in certain BLI Terms and Conditions, a term in such BLI Terms and Conditions might be viewed as inconsistent with a term in this Agreement, in which instance this Agreement could control, perhaps as follows:",
                "explanation": "Several phrases are altered to introduce ambiguity. 'With respect to' becomes 'Regarding,' 'has placed' becomes 'has potentially placed,' 'agree to' becomes 'may consider,' 'that apply' becomes 'that could apply,' 'notwithstanding anything to the contrary' becomes 'potentially notwithstanding some items to the contrary,' 'is inconsistent' becomes 'might be viewed as inconsistent,' 'in which case this Agreement shall control' becomes 'in which instance this Agreement could control.' The weakening of each phrase makes it more subjective and less enforceable, introducing uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "This section sets the hierarchy between the agreement and BLI’s ‘terms and conditions.’ The current version states directly and clearly that this agreement overrules theirs. The changes weaken the contract and make it ambiguous whether or not the terms and conditions of this agreement are what is binding, potentially rendering parts of the contract unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "The Consultant agrees to faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the Company and to devote the time, attention efforts to further the business interests of the Company and utilize his professional skills and care during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant will endeavor to serve the Company and to dedicate time and attention as reasonably practical to further the business interests of the Company and utilize his professional skills and care during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses strong obligations like 'agrees,' 'faithfully,' 'honestly,' and 'diligently serve.' The modified text uses 'endeavor to serve' and 'as reasonably practical,' weakening the obligation. This introduces ambiguity and makes it harder to enforce the consultant's commitment to the company's interests, creating a loophole where the consultant could argue that circumstances prevented them from fully dedicating their efforts. This contradicts the concept of 'good faith' effort that is often interpreted under New York law, and might be open to dispute.",

                "original_text": "The Consultant will faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the Company and cooperate with the Company and utilize maximum professional skill and care to ensure that all services rendered hereunder are to the satisfaction of the Company, acting reasonably, and the Consultant will provide any other services not specifically mentioned herein, but which by reason of the Consultant's capability, the Consultant knows or ought to know to be necessary to ensure that the best interests of the Company are maintained.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant will strive to serve the Company and collaborate with the Company, applying professional skill and care, to render services that generally align with the Company's satisfaction, acting reasonably, and the Consultant will consider providing other services not specifically mentioned herein, that the Consultant might perceive to be potentially beneficial for maintaining the interests of the Company.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces strong obligations with weaker, more ambiguous language. Replacing 'faithfully, honestly and diligently serve' with 'strive to serve' reduces the consultant's commitment. Changing 'maximum professional skill and care to ensure' to 'applying professional skill and care' weakens the standard of performance. Replacing 'knows or ought to know to be necessary to ensure that the best interests of the Company are maintained' with 'might perceive to be potentially beneficial for maintaining the interests of the Company' introduces subjectivity and reduces the consultant's responsibility. This contradicts the standard of objective reasonableness under New York contract law, making it harder to enforce the consultant's duty to act in the company's best interests.",

                "changed_text": "Each party will consider executing and delivering such further documents and assurances, and might undertake action, if deemed appropriate, to generally align with the spirit of this Agreement and to acknowledge the rights and remedies discussed within.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes a strong obligation for both parties to take action to further the agreement's intent. The modified version weakens this by replacing 'will promptly and duly execute' with 'will consider executing', 'take such further action' with 'might undertake action,' and 'reasonably request in order to more effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement and to establish and protect the rights and remedies created or intended to be created hereby' with 'if deemed appropriate, to generally align with the spirit of this Agreement and to acknowledge the rights and remedies discussed within.' This makes compliance discretionary and harder to enforce, conflicting with New York's interpretation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act in a way that doesn't undermine the agreement's purpose.",

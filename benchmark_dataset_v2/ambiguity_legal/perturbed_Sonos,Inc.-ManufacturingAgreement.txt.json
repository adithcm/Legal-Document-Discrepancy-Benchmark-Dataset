                "original_text": "IAC shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to the manufacturing and/or production of the Products in jurisdictions in which IAC manufactures the Products, including labor and employment, environmental, safety, tax and other similar regulations. In addition, IAC currently complies and will continue to comply with any applicable regulations regarding foreign child labor laws and other abusive labor practices.",
                "changed_text": "IAC shall endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations related to the manufacturing and/or production of the Products, including labor and employment, environmental, safety, tax and other similar regulations. In addition, IAC will attempt to comply with regulations regarding foreign child labor laws and other abusive labor practices.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the commitment to following laws, introducing ambiguity about the level of compliance required. Replacing 'will continue to comply' with 'will attempt to comply' introduces ambiguity about following labor practices. This could lead to non-compliance with labor laws.",

                "changed_text": "IAC will try to maintain Sonos Tools in reasonable working condition and will seek to keep Sonos Tools covered under IAC's property insurance, at its discretion and without expense to Sonos.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'commercially reasonable efforts to maintain...in good, satisfactory working condition' to 'will try to maintain...in reasonable working condition' introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of maintenance. Removing the requirement that insurance be at all times and at no expense to Sonos introduces ambiguity about the extent and cost of insurance coverage. This creates a loophole that doesn't ensure that tools are actually covered under insurance at all times.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall provide' with 'will attempt to provide' weakens the obligation to provide electronic tracking data, making it discretionary. Adding 'some tracking' and 'as feasible' introduces ambiguity regarding the completeness and regularity of the data provided, contradicting the original requirement for comprehensive tracking and reporting.",

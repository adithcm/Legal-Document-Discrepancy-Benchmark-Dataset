                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "FCC will throughout the Term maintain adequate manufacturing capacity and staffing to manufacture the Terpene Product pursuant to the terms hereof at the Facility.",
                "changed_text": "FCC will endeavor to maintain manufacturing capacity and staffing it believes is reasonably adequate to manufacture the Terpene Product at the Facility.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation to maintain 'adequate manufacturing capacity'. The modified text replaces 'maintain adequate' with 'endeavor to maintain manufacturing capacity and staffing it believes is reasonably adequate,' which introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation subjective and weaker. The standard for determining 'adequate' is now up to FCCâ€™s discretion rather than an objective measure.",

                "changed_text": "Each party hereto agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to handle materials in a manner it deems reasonably safe.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the original obligation to 'comply with all applicable federal, state... environmental law'. By replacing 'comply' with 'make commercially reasonable efforts to comply,' and 'environmentally safe manner' with 'a manner it deems reasonably safe,' the clause becomes ambiguous. The standard is now 'commercially reasonable' and subjectively 'reasonably safe' rather than strict compliance with environmental laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal and state environmental regulations like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act that require strict compliance, not just 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly warrants that the Terpene Product 'shall comply' with all relevant laws and regulations. The changed text replaces 'shall comply' with 'should generally conform with the spirit of', creating ambiguity. Compliance is no longer guaranteed, and the standard is subjective ('spirit of') rather than objective compliance with specific laws.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "FCC will throughout the Term maintain adequate manufacturing capacity and staffing to manufacture the Terpene Product pursuant to the terms hereof at the Facility.",
                "changed_text": "FCC will endeavor to maintain manufacturing capacity and staffing to manufacture the Terpene Product pursuant to the terms hereof at the Facility.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'maintain adequate' with 'endeavor to maintain' weakens the obligation. It suggests an attempt to maintain capacity and staffing, but doesn't guarantee it, potentially causing underproduction. This is ambiguous about what constitutes an appropriate endeavor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The specific law contradicted depends on the interpretation of 'endeavor to maintain' and whether a reasonable effort was made. This ambiguity weakens the enforceability of the capacity requirement.",
                "location": "Section 9"
            },
            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each party hereto agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state provincial and or local environmental law, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations and permits and to handle all raw materials, off specification product, excess or scrap materials, waste, and finished products in an environmentally safe manner so as to prevent any contamination of the structure, soil or ground water in, on, or adjacent to its premises.",
                "changed_text": "Each party hereto agrees to attempt to comply with all applicable federal, state provincial and or local environmental law, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations and permits and to handle all raw materials, off specification product, excess or scrap materials, waste, and finished products in a reasonably environmentally safe manner.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'attempt to comply' and 'reasonably environmentally safe manner' weakens the obligation to adhere to environmental regulations fully. 'Attempt to comply' is vague, and 'reasonably environmentally safe' opens to subjective interpretation, possibly leading to actions that are not fully compliant with environmental laws. The duty of preventing the contamination of the structure, soil or ground water is now no longer required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations - This change introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce environmental regulations, which often require strict compliance.",
                "location": "Section 16"
            },
            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "FCC warrants to Flotek that: (a) all of the Terpene Product supplied by FCC to Flotek shall: (ii) comply with all relevant laws and regulations including, without limitation, laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which the Terpene Product are either manufactured or to be sold or used concerning purity, sanitation, safety, security, and packaging and labeling of food and beverage",
                "changed_text": "FCC assures Flotek that: (a) all of the Terpene Product supplied by FCC to Flotek shall: (ii) generally meet all relevant laws and regulations concerning purity, sanitation, safety, security, and packaging and labeling of food and beverage.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'warrants' to 'assures' and 'comply with all relevant laws' to 'generally meet' weakens the guarantee of compliance. 'Generally meet' introduces ambiguity as to the extent of compliance required, creating a loophole for non-compliance with specific regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Depends on the regulations violated. This change creates ambiguity which could contradict specific regulations related to food and beverage safety, purity, and packaging.",

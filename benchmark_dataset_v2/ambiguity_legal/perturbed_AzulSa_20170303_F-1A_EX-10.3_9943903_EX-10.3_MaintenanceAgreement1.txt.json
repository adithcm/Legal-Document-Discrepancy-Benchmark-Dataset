                "original_text": "4.2 The Affected Party will give Notice to the other Party (the \"Non-Affected Party\") of such Excusable Delay as soon as reasonably possible after it becomes aware thereof, and the Affected Party will use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effects of such Excusable Delay, without being obliged however to incur any unreasonable costs.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 The Affected Party may give Notice to the other Party (the \"Non-Affected Party\") of such Excusable Delay when it deems appropriate after it becomes aware thereof, and the Affected Party may consider mitigating the effects of such Excusable Delay, without a clear obligation to incur specific costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'will give Notice' creating a clear obligation. This has been weakened to 'may give Notice when it deems appropriate,' making notification discretionary. Similarly, 'will use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate' is changed to 'may consider mitigating,' which introduces uncertainty. The phrase 'without a clear obligation to incur specific costs' introduces a financial ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Applicable in Brazil and New York). While not a codified statute, this principle requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of contracts. The modified clause allows a party to potentially avoid notifying the other party of delays or mitigating damages, which could be interpreted as a breach of this duty.",

                "original_text": "5.2.1 The Services shall comply with the applicable AMM, MRBR and MPD issued by ATR, as Aircraft manufacturer, and the relevant CMM in force as of the Signing Date, and with the EASA and/or FAA or ANAC regulations in force at the time of performance of such Services",
                "changed_text": "5.2.1 The Services should generally align with AMM, MRBR, and MPD issued by ATR, as Aircraft manufacturer, and the CMM that the Repairer considers relevant, and with the EASA, FAA, or ANAC regulations that the Repairer deems applicable at the time of performance of such Services.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement for strict compliance with regulations and manuals. Replacing 'shall comply' with 'should generally align' makes adherence discretionary. Furthermore, the added 'Repairer considers relevant' and 'Repairer deems applicable' introduces subjectivity, allowing the repairer to selectively comply with guidelines and regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) - 14 CFR Part 145 (Repair Stations). This regulation requires certified repair stations to adhere to specific standards and procedures. The modified clause introduces ambiguity and discretion, potentially conflicting with the FAR's requirement for consistent and verifiable compliance.",

                "changed_text": "8.1 Without prejudice to any term and condition under this Agreement, the Company will endeavor to maintain insurance coverage. The specific details, including insurer reputation and the scope of coverages, are subject to further discussion and mutual agreement between the parties, and the level of insurance should not be less than what the Company considers reasonable.",
                "explanation": "This paragraph weakens the legal obligation concerning insurance coverage. 'Shall maintain' is replaced with 'will endeavor to maintain', reducing the mandatory nature of the obligation. Further weakening is introduced by stating 'subject to further discussion and mutual agreement', which makes insurance requirements dependent on future negotiations, and the minimum cover is determined based on 'what the Company considers reasonable' introducing subjective and unilateral discretion.",

These articles mandate specific insurance coverage for aircraft operators, including hull, passenger, and third-party liability. The modified clause's ambiguity and weakened language regarding insurance obligations could conflict with these explicit requirements.",

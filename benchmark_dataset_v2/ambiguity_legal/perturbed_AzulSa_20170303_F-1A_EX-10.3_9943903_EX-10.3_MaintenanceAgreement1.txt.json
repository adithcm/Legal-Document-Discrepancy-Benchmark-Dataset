                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall return' with 'should endeavor to return' makes the obligation non-mandatory. The phrase 'reasonable timeframe' lacks a specific deadline, making enforcement difficult. This creates an ambiguous legal obligation.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a clear obligation to return unserviceable items within a specified timeframe. The change weakens this obligation by using 'may attempt,' which is discretionary, and 'generally timely fashion,' which is vague. This introduces ambiguity regarding the mandatory nature and timing of the return.",

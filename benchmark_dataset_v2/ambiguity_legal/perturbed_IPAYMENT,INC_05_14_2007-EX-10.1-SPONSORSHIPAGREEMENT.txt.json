                "original_text": "ISO shall collect completed and signed Application Materials and Merchant Processing Agreements from Applicants and shall forward them to SERVICERS within [***] [***] Business Days after the merchant is boarded (which may be accessed by SERVICERS online or forwarded to SERVICERS via ISO's automated application system or to a facsimile number designated by SERVICERS, provided such complies with the Rules and applicable laws, rules and regulations) or to any other place(s) as SERVICERS may designate for processing and document storage. ISO shall retain copies of all Application Materials, Merchant Processing Agreements and documents forwarded to SERVICERS. ISO shall provide SERVICERS with access to ISO's automated application system and ISO's online Merchant Account system (BAMS, or any such successor or replacement system) at no cost to SERVICERS.",
                "changed_text": "ISO shall endeavor to collect completed and signed Application Materials and Merchant Processing Agreements from Applicants and should forward them to SERVICERS within a reasonable timeframe after the merchant is boarded (which may be accessed by SERVICERS online or forwarded to SERVICERS via ISO's automated application system). ISO will try to retain copies of all Application Materials, Merchant Processing Agreements and documents forwarded to SERVICERS. ISO will consider providing SERVICERS with access to ISO's automated application system and ISO's online Merchant Account system (BAMS, or any such successor or replacement system).",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear obligation for ISO to collect and forward application materials within a defined timeframe. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'shall endeavor to' and 'should', 'will try' and 'will consider', making the action discretionary rather than mandatory. It also replaces the specific timeframe with 'a reasonable timeframe,' which is open to interpretation. This change weakens ISO's obligation and could lead to disputes over compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "The ambiguity created around timely submission and access to records may hinder compliance with **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** regulations. These regulations require financial institutions to maintain thorough records and provide access to them for regulatory oversight, and failing to do so is a violation.",

                "original_text": "ISO shall employ the Merchant Processing Policy guidelines provided by SERVICERS in making credit evaluations. SERVICERS reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to:\n\n  (a)   Change the Merchant Processing Policy;\n\n  (b)   Reject the Application of any Applicant who SERVICERS determine does not satisfy SERVICERS' Merchant Processing Policy; and\n\n  (c)   Terminate the Merchant Processing Agreement with respect to any Merchant at any time, according to the Merchant Processing Agreement terms.",
                "changed_text": "ISO will make efforts to consider the Merchant Processing Policy guidelines provided by SERVICERS when making credit evaluations. SERVICERS may reserve the right, at their discretion, to:\n\n  (a)   Adjust the Merchant Processing Policy;\n\n  (b)   Consider rejecting the Application of any Applicant who SERVICERS seemingly does not satisfy SERVICERS' Merchant Processing Policy; and\n\n  (c)   Evaluate the termination of the Merchant Processing Agreement with respect to any Merchant at any time.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligations by using phrases like 'make efforts to consider,' 'may reserve the right,' 'at their discretion,' 'seemingly does not satisfy' and 'evaluate the termination' instead of the original mandatory terms 'shall employ,' 'reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion,' 'reject,' and 'terminate.' These changes create ambiguity around both ISO's adherence to the policy and SERVICERS' actions, undermining the enforceability of the Merchant Processing Policy.",
                "contradicted_law": "The ambiguity allows for potentially discriminatory practices and undermines the consistency required for compliance with the **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)**. By making the Merchant Processing Policy less definitive, it increases the risk that credit decisions will be made on arbitrary or discriminatory grounds.",

The parties hereto will work together expeditiously and in good faith to register and maintain the registration of ISO and each Other MSP with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules.",
                "changed_text": "ISO will, to the extent feasible, attempt to maintain a registration as an independent service organization with Visa and a member service provider with MasterCard and will provide information that Visa and MasterCard may request, if practical. ISO will supply SERVICERS with information concerning compliance with Rules, laws, regulations, and requirements in this Agreement, as reasonably possible. The parties may collaborate to register and maintain the registration of ISO and each Other MSP with Bank Card associations.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall at all times' with 'to the extent feasible, attempt to maintain,' 'shall provide' with 'will provide if practical,' and 'will provide SERVICERS' with 'will supply SERVICERS as reasonably possible.' This weakens the mandatory nature of maintaining registration and providing information, making it conditional and discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "The weakened obligation to maintain registration and provide information hinders compliance with **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** requirements, which mandate that all parties involved in card processing must maintain compliance. By introducing ambiguity, this undermines the consistent and mandatory compliance required.",

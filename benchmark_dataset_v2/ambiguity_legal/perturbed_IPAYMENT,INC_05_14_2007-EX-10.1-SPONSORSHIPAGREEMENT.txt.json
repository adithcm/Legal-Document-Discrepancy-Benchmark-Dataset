                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "ISO shall be responsible for ensuring that the Application Materials, the marketing plans, the Promotional Materials and all services performed by ISO hereunder comply, and remain in compliance with, all applicable Rules, laws and regulations; provided, however, that SERVICERS will in good faith inform ISO of issues or concerns with ISO's materials or practices observed by SERVICERS that SERVICERS reasonably believe may be in violation of applicable Rules. All documents and any changes to the form and content thereof must be approved in writing by SERVICERS prior to use by ISO, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond fifteen (15) days.",
                "changed_text": "ISO should endeavor to ensure that the Application Materials, the marketing plans, the Promotional Materials and all services performed by ISO hereunder generally align with applicable Rules, laws and regulations. All documents and any changes to the form and content thereof must be submitted for review by SERVICERS prior to use by ISO, which review will occur when SERVICERS have adequate time to process them.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that ISO 'shall be responsible for ensuring compliance' with applicable laws and regulations. The modified text weakens this obligation by stating that ISO 'should endeavor to ensure' and that materials 'generally align' with the rules, laws and regulations. The language that indicates 'adequate time to process them' creates uncertainty around when it will be reviewed and approved.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary, potentially contradicting laws and regulations like the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), which require strict compliance with consumer protection laws regarding disclosures and fair practices.",

                "original_text": "ISO shall collect completed and signed Application Materials and Merchant Processing Agreements from Applicants and shall forward them to SERVICERS within [***] [***] Business Days after the merchant is boarded (which may be accessed by SERVICERS online or forwarded to SERVICERS via ISO's automated application system or to a facsimile number designated by SERVICERS, provided such complies with the Rules and applicable laws, rules and regulations) or to any other place(s) as SERVICERS may designate for processing and document storage. ISO shall retain copies of all Application Materials, Merchant Processing Agreements and documents forwarded to SERVICERS. ISO shall provide SERVICERS with access to ISO's automated application system and ISO's online Merchant Account system (BAMS, or any such successor or replacement system) at no cost to SERVICERS.",
                "changed_text": "ISO shall collect Application Materials and Merchant Processing Agreements from Applicants and should forward them to SERVICERS within a reasonable timeframe after the merchant is boarded. ISO shall attempt to retain copies of all Application Materials, Merchant Processing Agreements and documents forwarded to SERVICERS. ISO will endeavor to provide SERVICERS with access to ISO's automated application system and ISO's online Merchant Account system.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'shall collect' and 'shall forward' with 'should forward', making the obligation less strict. Replacing '[***] [***] Business Days' with 'a reasonable timeframe' introduces ambiguity, while 'attempt to retain' and 'endeavor to provide' further weaken ISO's responsibilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "By weakening the requirement to forward documents within a specific timeframe and changing the language to 'attempt' and 'endeavor', the amended terms can lead to non-compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, which require financial institutions to maintain accurate records and report suspicious activity promptly.",

                "changed_text": "From time to time, Bank may attempt to advise ISO of amendments to the Rules. ISO may then consider whether to notify each Merchant of any change in the Merchant Program.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation for the Bank to advise ISO of rule changes by adding 'may attempt'. It also makes ISO's notification to the Merchant discretionary by stating that ISO 'may then consider whether to notify'.",
                "contradicted_law": "This can contradict the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), which requires specific and timely disclosures to consumers regarding changes in terms or conditions of their accounts. It also can contradict PCI DSS requirements, because merchants must have timely notifications when security protocols and rules need to be updated.",

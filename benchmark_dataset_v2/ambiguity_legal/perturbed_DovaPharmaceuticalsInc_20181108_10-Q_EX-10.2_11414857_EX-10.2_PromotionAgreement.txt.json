                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In conducting the Valeant Activities hereunder, Valeant shall, and shall require all Field Force Personnel to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "In conducting the Valeant Activities hereunder, Valeant shall use its best efforts to ensure that all Field Force Personnel generally comply with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces the strict compliance requirement with a 'best efforts' obligation, making it ambiguous whether full compliance is actually required. This introduces uncertainty and weakens the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "The change contradicts requirements for strict compliance with laws such as the Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b et seq.) and the Federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733), which mandate full compliance.",

                "explanation": "The insertion of 'knowingly,' 'excessive,' and 'primary intent to unlawfully induce' introduces ambiguity. What constitutes 'excessive remuneration' or 'primary intent' is subjective and open to interpretation, making it difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change undermines the Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b et seq.), which prohibits offering or paying any remuneration to induce referrals, regardless of intent.",

                "changed_text": "Valeant shall instruct the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing to conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product, and will monitor and audit (as it deems reasonably necessary) the Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing so that such personnel conduct the Valeant Activities for the Product in general adherence with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'in accordance with Valeant's standard practice' to 'as it deems reasonably necessary,' the monitoring and auditing become discretionary. Replacing 'in adherence in all respects' with 'in general adherence' weakens the compliance requirement and introduces ambiguity. This can lead to less rigorous oversight and potential violations of law.",

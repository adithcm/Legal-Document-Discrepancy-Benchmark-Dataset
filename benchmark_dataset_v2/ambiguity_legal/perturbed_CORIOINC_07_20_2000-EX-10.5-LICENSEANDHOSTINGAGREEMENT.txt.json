                "original_text": "Commerce One shall provide Corio with support described in EXHIBIT C hereto, and maintenance in the form of Updates and Upgrades. Corio shall be responsible for providing its Customers with routine technical support of the Software and MarketSite.net Service. Corio shall escalate any technical support questions or problems it is unable to answer or resolve directly to Commerce One for Commerce One's immediate attention and resolution under the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto.",
                "changed_text": "Commerce One will endeavor to provide support described in EXHIBIT C hereto, and maintenance in the form of Updates and Upgrades. Corio will attempt to provide its Customers with routine technical support of the Software and MarketSite.net Service. Corio may escalate technical support questions or problems it is unable to answer or resolve directly to Commerce One for consideration under the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' makes the support obligation less definitive. Similarly, changing 'shall be responsible' to 'will attempt to provide' introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of Corio's support responsibilities. Replacing 'shall escalate' with 'may escalate' makes escalating unresolved issues optional, not mandatory, potentially violating customer support standards.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'may indemnify, defend and hold harmless' introduces ambiguity, making the indemnification discretionary. Removing 'reasonable' before 'attorneys' fees' allows for the possibility of unreasonable or capped attorney fees. Deleting 'promptly' makes timely notification less strict and harder to enforce.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association ('RULES'). The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California.",
                "changed_text": "Disputes arising out of this Agreement may be subject to non-binding mediation or arbitration. Any arbitration could be conducted under rules determined at that time. The parties agree to consider using a single arbitrator. The enforcement of any resolution shall be as determined by the parties involved.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the dispute resolution process. Replacing 'shall be resolved by binding arbitration' with 'may be subject to non-binding mediation or arbitration' makes arbitration optional and non-binding. Introducing uncertainty with 'could be conducted under rules determined at that time' makes the arbitration process less predictable. 'Shall' is replaced with \"may\". The addition of \"The enforcement of any resolution shall be as determined by the parties involved.\" eliminates a clear path to judgement.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which promotes and enforces binding arbitration agreements. This change undermines the enforceability of arbitration awards.",

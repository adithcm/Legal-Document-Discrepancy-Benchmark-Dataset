                "original_text": "Sponsor shall indemnify and hold harmless, Fruit of Life Productions LLC, its related entities, partners, agents, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, heirs, successors, and assigns from against any and all claims, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses), and liabilities of every kind incurred as a result of: (i) any act or omission by Sponsor or its officers, directors, entities, employees, agents; (ii) any use of Sponsor's name, logo, Website, or other information, products, or service provided by Sponsor; and/or (iii) the inaccuracy or breach of any of the covenants, representations and warranties made by Sponsor in this Agreement. (iv) any changes in company value or brand value.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall endeavor to indemnify Fruit of Life Productions LLC, its related entities, partners, agents, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, heirs, successors, and assigns from claims, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, costs, and expenses. This indemnification applies only to claims arising directly from the Sponsor's gross negligence, or willful misconduct as definitively adjudicated by a court.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear and broad obligation for the Sponsor to indemnify the Promoter against all claims. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall indemnify and hold harmless' with 'shall endeavor to indemnify', weakening the obligation. It also limits the indemnification to situations involving 'gross negligence or willful misconduct as definitively adjudicated by a court,' making it more difficult to enforce, as these are high legal bars to clear. It creates ambiguity around implied duties, which is a violation of Florida’s duty to defend under the law.",

The provisions of this section shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Warranties: Each party represents that it intends to comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to this agreement, and they will endeavor to exercise what they believe is due care and good faith. The extent of this section’s survival after termination is subject to reasonable interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear warranty that each party 'shall comply with all laws and regulations.' The modified text weakens this by stating that each party 'intends to comply' and will 'endeavor to exercise what they believe is due care and good faith.' This introduces ambiguity and makes compliance less certain. The last sentence used to be clear but now the term \"reasonable interpretation\" is added which causes ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the parties 'agree to pursue Arbitration as the preferred method' and 'waive the right to a jury trial.' The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the parties 'may consider arbitration' and that the waiver of a jury trial is 'subject to further negotiation.' This makes the dispute resolution process uncertain and potentially unenforceable. It weakens the original binding agreement to arbitrate.",

                "original_text": "The Company will use the net proceeds received in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Shares and will cause the Operating Partnership to use the net proceeds received in connection with the issuance and sale of the Company Preferred OP Units in the manner described in the \"Use of Proceeds\" section of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the Company does not intend to use any of the proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares hereunder to repay any outstanding debt owed to any affiliate of the Agent.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to use the net proceeds received in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Shares and will encourage the Operating Partnership to use the net proceeds received in connection with the issuance and sale of the Company Preferred OP Units generally in the manner described in the \"Use of Proceeds\" section of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the Company may consider using some of the proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares hereunder to repay any outstanding debt owed to any affiliate of the Agent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. 'Endeavor to use' and 'encourage' are not definitive obligations, weakening the commitment to the stated use of proceeds. 'Generally in the manner described' allows for deviation from the stated plan, and 'may consider using some of the proceeds' opens the possibility of repaying debt to affiliates, creating potential conflicts of interest. This contradicts SEC regulations requiring clear and transparent disclosure of how proceeds will be used, as outlined in Item 504 of Regulation S-K. This vagueness makes it hard to enforce the intended use of funds, potentially misleading investors.",

                "changed_text": "The Company will use reasonable efforts to facilitate the qualification of the Offered Shares for sale under the laws of jurisdictions the Agent may identify, but makes no guarantee that such qualifications will be obtained or maintained.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the company *will* arrange for qualification. By replacing it with 'will use reasonable efforts to facilitate', this introduces ambiguity and discretion. Adding that the company 'makes no guarantee that such qualifications will be obtained or maintained' creates a loophole, potentially allowing the company to avoid necessary compliance with state securities laws (Blue Sky laws) without a clear breach of contract. While the contract is governed by New York law, the underlying sale of securities is subject to each state's securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Manager \"will not be or become\" an investment advisor. The revision softens this statement by expressing a lack of intention (\"does not intend to become\"). This change weakens the commitment, allowing for potential future reinterpretation or loopholes regarding compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.",

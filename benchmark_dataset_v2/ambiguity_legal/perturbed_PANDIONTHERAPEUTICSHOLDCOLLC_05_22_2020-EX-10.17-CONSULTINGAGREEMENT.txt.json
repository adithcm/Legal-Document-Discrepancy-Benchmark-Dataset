                "original_text": "The Consultant shall use Consultant's best efforts in the performance of Consultant's obligations under this Agreement. The Company shall provide such access to its information and property as may be reasonably required in order to permit the Consultant to perform Consultant's obligations hereunder. The Consultant shall cooperate with the Company's personnel, shall not interfere with the conduct of the Company's business and shall observe all rules, regulations and security requirements of the Company concerning the safety of persons and property.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant will attempt to use Consultant's best efforts in the performance of Consultant's obligations under this Agreement. The Company will endeavor to provide access to its information and property as may be reasonably considered necessary in order to permit the Consultant to perform Consultant's obligations hereunder. The Consultant should generally cooperate with the Company's personnel, try not to unduly interfere with the conduct of the Company's business, and generally observe the rules, regulations, and security requirements of the Company concerning the safety of persons and property.",
                "explanation": "The changes from 'shall' to 'will attempt to', 'endeavor to', 'should generally', and 'try not to unduly interfere' weakens the obligations and introduces ambiguity regarding the level of effort and commitment required. This makes enforcement difficult, as 'attempt,' 'endeavor,' 'generally,' and 'unduly' are subjective terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms for enforceability. A Massachusetts court might find this clause too vague to enforce specific performance, rendering the agreement partially illusory.",

All such materials or copies thereof and all tangible property of the Company in the custody or possession of the Consultant shall be delivered to the Company, upon the earlier of (i) a request by the Company or (ii) the termination of this Agreement. After such delivery, the Consultant shall not retain any such materials or copies thereof or any such tangible property.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant understands that files, documents, letters, memoranda, reports, records, data, sketches, drawings, models, laboratory notebooks, program listings, computer equipment or devices, computer programs or other written, photographic, or other tangible material potentially containing Proprietary Information, whether created by the Consultant or others, which come into Consultant's custody or possession, are generally considered the property of the Company and should be used by the Consultant in a manner consistent with Consultant's duties for the Company and may be copied or removed from the Company premises if reasonably necessary. Upon request by the Company or termination of this Agreement, the Consultant will endeavor to return such materials to the best of Consultant's ability.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees that...shall be' with 'understands that...are generally considered' significantly weakens the property rights clause. Adding 'potentially containing' makes it unclear which materials are covered. 'Should be used in a manner consistent' is vague. 'May be copied or removed if reasonably necessary' contradicts the original restriction, and 'will endeavor to return...to the best of Consultant's ability' creates uncertainty about the obligation to return materials.",
                "contradicted_law": "Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A, which addresses unfair or deceptive trade practices. The ambiguities around proprietary information could lead to disputes about ownership and permissible use, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

Such written records shall be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant will try to disclose to the Company any Inventions and will attempt to maintain records to document the conception of any Invention. Such written records, if created, should be available to the Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall promptly disclose' to 'will try to disclose' weakens the obligation. 'Adequate and current written records' is changed to 'attempt to maintain records', removing specificity and making it discretionary. Removing 'first actual reduction to practice' limits the scope of documented inventions. Changing 'shall be available to and remain the sole property' to 'should be available to' introduces uncertainty regarding access and ownership.",

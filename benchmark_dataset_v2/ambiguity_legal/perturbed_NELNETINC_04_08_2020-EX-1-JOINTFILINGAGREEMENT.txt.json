                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned will consider jointly preparing and filing with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and future amendments regarding ownership of securities of the issuer, with the understanding that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D should be filed pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 where practically possible.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear and mandatory obligation to jointly prepare and file documents. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'will consider' and 'where practically possible,' making the obligation less definitive and potentially unenforceable. This weakens the legal requirement for joint filing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 13d-1(k). Specifically, the amendment introduces doubt to the mandatory requirement for joint filing when parties act as a group.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other, except to the extent that she or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each party should endeavor to ensure the timely filing of amendments and the general accuracy of their provided information, without necessarily taking responsibility for the accuracy of information provided by others, unless demonstrably aware of significant inaccuracies.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the responsibility of each party for timely filing and accuracy of their own information. The modified text uses 'should endeavor' and limits responsibility for others' information to cases of 'demonstrably aware of significant inaccuracies,' which is vague and difficult to prove. This reduces accountability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically related to liability for misstatements or omissions in filings. The vague language undermines the legal standard for due diligence.",

                "changed_text": "Dated: Approximately March 27, 2020.",
                "explanation": "By changing the date to 'approximately,' it introduces an ambiguity in the exact date the agreement was made. This can create issues around timely filing and determining the exact point in time the agreement became effective.",

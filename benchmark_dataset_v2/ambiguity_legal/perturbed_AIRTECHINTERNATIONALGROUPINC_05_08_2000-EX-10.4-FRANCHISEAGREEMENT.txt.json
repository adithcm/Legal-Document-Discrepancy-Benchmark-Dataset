                "changed_text": "You should consider promoting AIRSOPURE's Products and services and may attempt to develop the market for AIRSOPURE's Products and services in Your Exclusive Territory.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'should consider' and 'exert Your best efforts' with 'may attempt' introduces ambiguity, weakening the franchisee's obligation to actively promote and develop the market. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires franchisees to actively promote the franchisor's brand.",

                "changed_text": "You might forward copies of any notices of non-compliance by the Franchise with laws, rules, regulations, or ordinances to AIRSOPURE, possibly within a reasonable timeframe, perhaps with a short summary of potential actions.",
                "explanation": "The changed text uses vague language like 'might forward,' 'possibly within a reasonable timeframe,' and 'perhaps with a short summary,' making it unclear whether the franchisee is obligated to report non-compliance notices to AIRSOPURE. This ambiguity undermines the franchisor's ability to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and introduces vagueness. It also makes it more difficult to enforce the reporting requirement.",

                "changed_text": "Endeavor to operate the Franchise in general accordance with AIRSOPURE's policies, procedures, standards, and specifications as AIRSOPURE may occasionally suggest in the Operations Manual or in other communications. Changes to the system or Products are subject to franchisee discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'strict conformance' to 'general accordance' and 'may be prescribed' to 'may occasionally suggest' significantly weakens the franchisee's obligation to adhere to AIRSOPURE's operational standards. The statement 'Changes to the system or Products are subject to franchisee discretion' introduces ambiguity about whether the franchisee can deviate from AIRSOPURE's standards, potentially undermining brand consistency and quality control. This directly contradicts the Lanham Act because it permits the franchise owner to adjust what is considered standard to trademark",

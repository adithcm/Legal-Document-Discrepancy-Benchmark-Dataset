                "explanation": "Adding '(or equivalent)' to the Finance Manager title introduces ambiguity. The term 'equivalent' is not clearly defined, potentially allowing individuals without the necessary qualifications or authority to sign on behalf of the company. This can impact the validity of the agreement and compliance with corporate governance regulations that require specific roles to authorize certain actions.",

                "explanation": "The phrase '(if available)' after 'Treasury Director' introduces uncertainty about whether a Treasury Director is even required for the agreement's execution. This ambiguity weakens the legally binding nature of the signature, as it suggests the company may not have properly authorized representation. Regulations for financial reporting may stipulate that certain signatory parties are required for specific regulatory reasons.",

                "explanation": "By adding '(or other authorized person)' after 'Head of Capital Markets', it introduces ambiguity regarding who is legally authorized to sign on behalf of MERCK KGAA. This could be interpreted as allowing any individual the company deems 'authorized' to sign, even if they lack the appropriate legal standing or corporate authority required for such agreements, potentially violating corporate governance laws.",

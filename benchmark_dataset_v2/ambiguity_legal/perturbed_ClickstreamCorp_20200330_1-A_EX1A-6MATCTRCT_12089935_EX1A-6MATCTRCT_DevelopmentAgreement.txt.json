            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Developer agrees to do each of the following:\n1. Create the Application System as detailed in Exhibit A to this Agreement and extend its best efforts to ensure that the design and functionality of the Application System meets the Client's specifications.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer agrees to do each of the following:\n1. Create the Application System as generally described in Exhibit A to this Agreement and use reasonable efforts to ensure that the design and functionality of the Application System aligns with the Client's perceived specifications.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"as detailed\" with \"as generally described\" and \"meets the Client's specifications\" with \"aligns with the Client's perceived specifications,\" the obligation becomes vague. The term \"generally described\" lacks specific requirements, and \"perceived specifications\" introduces subjectivity, making it difficult to enforce precise design and functionality standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Creates uncertainty and makes specific performance difficult to enforce, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing depending on the interpretation.",

                "original_text": "The Developer shall not develop, maintain or market a similar platform and will not compete with the Client directly or indirectly worldwide.",
                "changed_text": "The Developer shall endeavor not to develop, maintain, or market an explicitly similar platform and will consider avoiding direct competition with the Client worldwide to a reasonable extent.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'shall endeavor not to' weakens the prohibition, and adding qualifiers like 'explicitly similar' and 'reasonable extent' introduce ambiguity. This undermines the non-compete clause, making it difficult to enforce and providing the Developer with loopholes to potentially engage in competitive activities.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, which generally prohibits non-compete agreements. The original clause already has enforceability issues; this ambiguity further weakens its position.",
                "location": "7.(b).7"
            },
            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "If programming errors or other defects are discovered during the Support Period, the Developer shall promptly remedy those errors or defects at its own expense.",
                "changed_text": "If programming errors or other defects are purportedly discovered during the Support Period, the Developer will consider addressing those errors or defects, potentially at its own expense, depending on the severity and impact as reasonably determined by the Developer.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces significant ambiguity by using terms such as \"purportedly discovered,\" \"will consider addressing,\" and \"depending on the severity and impact as reasonably determined by the Developer.\" This weakens the developer's obligation to fix errors and defects, making it discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'reasonably determined by the developer' creates a conflict of interest, as the developer is now the judge of their own errors.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - The ambiguity makes it difficult to enforce the warranty, potentially violating the implied warranty of merchantability.",

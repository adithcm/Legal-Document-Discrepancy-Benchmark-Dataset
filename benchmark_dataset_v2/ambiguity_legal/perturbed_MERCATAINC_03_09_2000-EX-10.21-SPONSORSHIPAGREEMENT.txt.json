Three (3) :30 second Sponsor produced commercials (\"Concept                 Ads\") to air within each of three (3) preseason telecasts.              2.

                "explanation": "The original text contains clear obligations (e.g., \"Sponsor shall receive,\" \"Three (3) commercials to air\"). The modified text introduces ambiguity by using words like \"generally,\" \"reasonably available,\" \"approximately,\" \"potentially,\" and \"subject to Sponsor's consideration.\" This weakens the guarantees of the sponsorship benefits, making them discretionary rather than mandatory. The term 'may be featured' also makes the appearance of Shawn Springs non-committal, which may affect the value of the sponsorship.",

The modified text weakens this obligation by using phrases such as \"may, at its discretion,\" \"certain claims,\" \"possibly including,\" and \"as determined appropriate by FNW.\" This makes the indemnification clause discretionary and subjective, leaving Sponsor vulnerable and with unclear protection.",

Phrases like \"may be provided\", \"considered potentially delivered\", and \"subject to reasonable interpretation\" create ambiguity.

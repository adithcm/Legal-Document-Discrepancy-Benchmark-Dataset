                "changed_text": "Content shall be reviewed by Sponsor, and approval will not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires content to be approved by the Sponsor without defining what 'approved' means, potentially giving the sponsor unlimited discretion. The changed text adds 'approval will not be unreasonably withheld,' which is ambiguous because what constitutes 'unreasonable' is undefined, leading to disputes. This may violate Washington's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, requiring parties to act honestly and fairly.",

                "changed_text": "Extension beyond the sixty (60) days may be offered to Sponsor at a cpm based rate.",
                "explanation": "By changing the original sentence, the clause 'favorable' is eliminated and the word 'to offered' is changed to 'may be offered.' This wording introduces ambiguity. While the original clause creates an obligation to offer a favorable rate, the new text makes the extension optional and removes any requirement for a favorable rate. This ambiguity can lead to disputes about the terms of any extension. Washington's Consumer Protection Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor may use Seahawks trademarks for promotional purposes in a manner they deem appropriate to convey the Sponsor benefits described herein. However, all such rights shall expire at some point after the 1999 regular season.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'as necessary' with 'in a manner they deem appropriate,' giving Sponsor broad discretion over trademark use. Furthermore, replacing 'the end of the 1999 regular season' with 'some point after the 1999 regular season' makes the expiration date vague. Trademark law requires specific, clear agreements about use. This conflicts with general trademark principles related to the license and authorized use of trademarks.",

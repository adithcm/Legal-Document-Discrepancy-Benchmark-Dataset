                "original_text": "Party B warrants that any and all information provided or released onto the Cooperation Channel during the Cooperation is in no violation of PRC laws, general code of ethics and intellectual property and/or other legal interests of any third party and, upon occurrence of such violation, Party B will delete the violating information from the Cooperation Channel, resolve any dispute and be liable for any consequence arising thereof, and indemnify Party A for any loss incurred by Party A thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Party B will endeavor to ensure that information provided or released onto the Cooperation Channel during the Cooperation generally aligns with PRC laws and the general code of ethics. In the event of a potential violation, Party B will consider deleting the information from the Cooperation Channel, attempt to resolve any dispute, and may be responsible for some consequences arising thereof, subject to further negotiation. Indemnification of Party A for losses will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'warrants' with 'will endeavor,' weakening the guarantee of compliance. 'Generally aligns' is vague, and the discretionary language around deleting violating information and resolving disputes creates uncertainty. The phrase 'may be responsible for some consequences' dilutes the liability, and 'determined on a case-by-case basis' adds further ambiguity to the indemnification, conflicting with the expected strict liability under PRC laws regarding content publication.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive cooperator of Party A's real estate and home furnishing cooperation channel. Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive provider of real estate and home furnishing information, products and data in Party A's real estate and home furnishing channel. Party A may not make any identical or similar cooperation regarding the real estate and home furnishing information, products and data in its real estate and home furnishing channel with any competitor of Party B.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party B and its affiliates should generally be the preferred cooperator of Party A's real estate and home furnishing cooperation channel. Party B and its affiliates should usually be the main provider of real estate and home furnishing information, products and data in Party A's real estate and home furnishing channel. Party A will try to avoid making identical or closely similar cooperation regarding the real estate and home furnishing information, products and data in its real estate and home furnishing channel with any direct competitor of Party B when practical.",
                "explanation": "The modified text uses 'should generally be the preferred cooperator', 'should usually be the main provider', and 'will try to avoid', which weaken the exclusivity clause by making it non-binding. These changes make Party A's obligations unclear and subjective, as 'preferred,' 'usually,' and 'try to avoid' are open to interpretation. This could be interpreted as a breach of contract if Party A collaborates with a competitor, leading to legal disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Any Party (the \"Receiving Party') will endeavor to keep confidential any business secret received by it from the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and, absent explicit instruction from the Disclosing Party, may disclose such information to a third party if such disclosure seems reasonable in the Receiving Party's judgement, but the party will not be held liable for any loss incurred by the Disclosing Party, particularly if such information:   (a) Was probably known to the Receiving Party without any non-disclosure obligation prior to its receipt of the same from the Disclosing Party;   (b) May have been known to the public without intentional action from the Receiving Party;   (c) Appears to be legally received from any third party without apparent non-disclosure obligation or use restriction;   (d) Seems to be developed independently by the Receiving Party;   (e) Has been disclosed without direct written objection from the Disclosing Party; and   (f) Is disclosed because of legal requirements having jurisdiction of the Receiving Party, without the requirement of the Receiving Party needing to notify the Disclosing Party of the exact business secret to be disclosed, except when such notification is convenient.",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'will endeavor to keep confidential', 'seems reasonable in the Receiving Party's judgement', 'particularly if', 'probably known', 'May have been known', 'Appears to be legally received', 'Seems to be developed', 'direct written objection', and 'except when such notification is convenient', introduce ambiguity and discretion to the Receiving Party's obligations. By eliminating the liability and reducing the required protective measures, especially regarding notification before disclosure due to legal requirements, weakens the obligation to protect confidential information. This change weakens the confidentiality obligation. The 'reasonable judgement' clause and elimination of guaranteed liability are now unenforceable under PRC law.",

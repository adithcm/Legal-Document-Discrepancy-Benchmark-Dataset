                "original_text": "Party B warrants that none of the articles, contents and web pages of the Cooperation channel is in violation of PRC laws or any international treaty to which the PRC is a signatory, including without limitation any content detrimental to national security, of pornographic, fraudulent, insulting, defamatory, hectoring or harassing nature, infringing upon the copyrights, personal rights or any other valid rights and interests of any other parties or in breach of any social customs, or any linkage thereto. If Party A receives any complaint regarding the content of the Cooperation channel, Party B shall resolve such complaint immediately, negotiate with or respond to any review or enquiry from any third party or competent authorities at its own expenses, and be liable for any loss incurred by Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party B will endeavor to ensure that the articles, contents, and web pages of the Cooperation channel do not violate PRC laws or any international treaty to which the PRC is a signatory. If Party A receives any complaint regarding the content of the Cooperation channel, Party B will address the complaint as reasonably feasible.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'warrants' with 'will endeavor to ensure', weakening the guarantee of compliance with PRC laws. Additionally, 'shall resolve such complaint immediately' is replaced with 'will address the complaint as reasonably feasible,' making the obligation to resolve complaints vague and subject to interpretation. This could lead to non-compliance with regulations concerning content restrictions and liability for illegal content, potentially conflicting with the Cybersecurity Law of the PRC, which requires strict content monitoring and immediate action against illegal content.",

Party B has absolute and sole control, approval and discretion regarding the advertising operation of the Cooperation Channel, may conduct and benefit from legal advertising operations at its sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "Party A agrees that the pricing, specifications, and contents of the advertising on the Cooperation Channel should generally be subject to the discretion of Party B, unless otherwise required by Party A. Party B has control, approval, and discretion regarding the advertising operation of the Cooperation Channel, and may conduct and benefit from advertising operations.",
                "explanation": "Introducing 'should generally be subject' and 'unless otherwise required by Party A' makes the advertising control discretionary and can lead to conflicts with the PRC Advertising Law, which requires that all advertisements comply with specific content standards and regulations. The original text granted Party B sole discretion, but this change allows Party A to potentially interfere with Party B's advertising operations, leading to violations of advertising regulations if Party A's interventions result in non-compliant ads.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party A undertakes to promote the key word (including any of the key words relating to real properties, building material products and home furnishing) involved in the Cooperation Channel. Party A warrants that such key word will be promoted on the open search platform of Baidu and preferentially displayed at the left side of the search result pages, the exact display position of which is subject to separate agreement between the Parties. The search results will link to the real estate and home furnishing channel under cooperation of the Parties. The key words will be provided to Party B to Party A, and the information included in any of the key words and their search results will be in compliance with laws and regulations, as well as business rules of Party A, including without limitation user's experience. Party B agrees that Party A may modify the display of search results out of consideration relating to user experience, provided that such modification will not materially change the display, content and position of the search results. Party A will be deemed in breach of this Agreement if it is required to modify search results pursuant to laws, regulations, court rulings or other mandatory documents.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party A will consider promoting keywords involved in the Cooperation Channel. Party A will endeavor to promote such keywords on the open search platform of Baidu. The search results may link to the real estate and home furnishing channel under cooperation of the Parties. The information included in any of the key words and their search results should be in compliance with laws and regulations. Party B agrees that Party A may modify the display of search results as it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens Party A's obligation to promote keywords. 'Undertakes to promote' is changed to 'will consider promoting,' making the promotion optional. 'Warrants that such keyword will be promoted and preferentially displayed' is reduced to 'will endeavor to promote,' further reducing the commitment. The removal of 'provided that such modification will not materially change the display, content and position of the search results' gives Party A broad discretion to modify search results, potentially leading to a reduction in visibility for Party B's channel. 'Should be in compliance with laws and regulations', reduces the strictness of the wording compared to original. This could violate the PRC Advertising Law or the E-Commerce Law, both of which regulate online advertising and require clear and prominent display of advertising information.",

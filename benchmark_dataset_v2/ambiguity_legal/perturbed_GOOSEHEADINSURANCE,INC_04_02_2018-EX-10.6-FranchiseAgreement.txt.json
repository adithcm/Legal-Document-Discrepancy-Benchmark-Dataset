                "original_text": "6.2.2 All of your employees who are licensed to sell insurance (\"Producers\") must also attend and complete to our satisfaction, our Producer training program before any Producer is permitted to sell insurance for the Franchised Business or access our database or systems.",
                "changed_text": "6.2.2 All of your employees who are licensed to sell insurance (“Producers”) are encouraged to attend our Producer training program. Producers may be permitted to sell insurance for the Franchised Business or access our database or systems following a period of on-the-job training.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that all licensed employees (Producers) must attend and complete the training program before being allowed to sell insurance or access the database. The modified text makes the training optional ('are encouraged') and introduces 'on-the-job training,' which is vague and does not guarantee compliance with state-mandated training requirements for licensed insurance agents. This ambiguity creates non-compliance with state laws regarding insurance agent training.",

Before starting any activities or operations under this Agreement, you agree to procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement (and for such period thereafter as is necessary to provide the coverages required under this Agreement for events having occurred during the Term of this Agreement), at your expense, at least the following insurance policy or policies in connection with the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises, or by reason of the construction, operation, or occupancy of the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises.",

Before starting any activities or operations under this Agreement, you agree to procure and maintain, to the best of your ability, insurance policy or policies in connection with the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises, or by reason of the construction, operation, or occupancy of the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the franchisee's agreement to procure and maintain specific insurance policies. By adding 'to the best of your ability,' the modified text introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation non-mandatory. This can result in non-compliance with contractual obligations and potentially with state insurance regulations, as 'best of your ability' is subjective and does not ensure adequate coverage.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing a clear requirement for professional indemnity insurance with specific coverage amounts and deductible limits with a subjective standard of 'what coverage is reasonably available given prevailing market conditions.' This undermines the franchisee's obligation to secure adequate professional indemnity insurance, increasing the risk to both the franchisee and the franchisor and potentially conflicting with regulations regarding minimum insurance coverage for certain professions.",

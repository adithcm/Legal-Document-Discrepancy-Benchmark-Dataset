Such policy or policies must be written by an insurance company or companies we have approved, having at all times a rating of at least \"A-\" in the most recent Key Rating Guide published by the A.M. Best Company (or another rating that we reasonably designate if A.M. Best Company no longer publishes the Key Rating Guide) and licensed and admitted to do business in the state in which the Franchised Business is located, and must include, at a minimum (except that we may reasonably specify additional coverages and higher policy limits for all franchisees periodically in the Manual or otherwise in writing to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in the law or standards of liability, higher damage awards and other relevant changes in circumstances), the following:",
                "changed_text": "Before starting any activities or operations under this Agreement, you agree to procure and maintain insurance policies. These policies should generally align with the following guidelines in connection with the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises, or by reason of the construction, operation, or occupancy of the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises. Such policy or policies should be written by an insurance company or companies that we find generally acceptable, with a rating that is typically around \"A-\" according to what we can gather from sources like the A.M. Best Company (or another rating that we may consider relevant). These policies might include the following:",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agree to procure and maintain in full force and effect' with 'agree to procure and maintain insurance policies' and using qualifiers like 'generally align with,' 'generally acceptable,' and 'typically around.' This makes the insurance requirements less definite and more open to interpretation. This contradicts the standard of care required by insurance regulations, which demand clear and specific coverage to protect the insured and third parties from financial loss.",

This insurance should consider protecting against claims for personal, bodily, and/or property injury occurring in or about the Franchised Business and assumed or contractual liability under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'Commercial general liability insurance, including us...' This is modified to 'Commercial general liability insurance, possibly including us...' The term 'possibly' introduces ambiguity, making it unclear whether the franchisee is definitively required to include the franchisor and its affiliates as additional insureds. This contradicts general liability insurance principles, which demand clarity on insured parties.",

Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent       at the price stated on a current price list or according to the current       price program minus a ten (10) percent discount as outlined in Paragraph       1.5(d). It is the responsibility of the Agent to evaluate the credit       worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the       Company, the Agent accepts full responsibility for payment of the product       from the Customer.",

Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent at the price stated on a current price list or according to the current price program minus a ten (10) percent discount as outlined in Paragraph 1.5(d). The Agent might evaluate the credit worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the Company, the Agent is generally responsible for payment of the product from the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces \"follow promptly\" with \"endeavor to adhere to, as reasonably possible,\" weakening the obligation to comply with the credit policy. Stating that the agent 'might evaluate' instead of 'is the responsibility' introduces ambiguity to credit worthiness evaluation, and changing 'accepts full responsibility' to 'is generally responsible' makes the payment obligation less definitive. This creates ambiguity around the agent's financial responsibility.",

The Agent will use the Trademarks only in such fashion as has been expressly authorized by the Company in writing. Such use will not give the Agent any interest in the Trademarks, except the right to display the Trademarks as expressly provided herein. The Agent will not use any Trademark in connection with any products other than the Products. Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, the Agent will immediately cease all use of the Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Agent should attempt to promote and sell the Products to Customers in the Territory under trademarks, copyrights, brand names and product names as the Company has registered, or as the Company has otherwise suggested for use on Products (collectively, the \"Trademarks\"). The Agent may use the Trademarks in a manner that seems appropriate. Such use will not grant the Agent any interest in the Trademarks, beyond the ability to display them within reason. The Agent may not intentionally use any Trademark with non-approved products. After the agreement ends, the Agent should discontinue Trademark use.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"will promote and sell only under\" to \"should attempt to promote and sell under\" and \"requested be used\" to \"suggested for use\" weakens the obligation. Replacing \"expressly authorized\" with \"in a manner that seems appropriate\" introduces significant ambiguity, removing control over trademark usage. \"May not intentionally use\" creates a loophole based on intent. The phrase 'within reason' provides the agent significant flexibility.",

Each product liability insurance policy of the Company will name the Agent (as its interest may appear) as an additional insured under the policy and provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Agent of any cancellation, modification, or amendment of this policy. Each party will furnish to the other upon request a Certificate of Insurance or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the other evidencing compliance with this Paragraph 3.3.",
                "changed_text": "The Agent's liability insurance policy may include the Company as an additional insured, as relevant, and attempt to provide notice of policy changes where feasible. The Company's product liability insurance policy might include the Agent as an additional insured, as applicable, and endeavor to give notice of policy changes when possible. Each party will, if asked, offer some documentation to indicate compliance with this Paragraph 3.3.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"will name...as an additional insured\" to \"may include...as relevant\" and \"might include...as applicable\" makes the insurance coverage discretionary. Altering \"provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice\" to \"attempt to provide notice...where feasible\" and \"endeavor to give notice...when possible\" weakens the notification requirement. The phrase 'some documentation' provides ambiguity as the level of proof required.",

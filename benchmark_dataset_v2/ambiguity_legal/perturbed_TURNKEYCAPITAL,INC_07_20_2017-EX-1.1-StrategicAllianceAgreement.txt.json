                "original_text": "TKCI shall establish a wholly-owned subsidiary (the \"Holding Company\") for the sole purpose of conducting and developing business on behalf of this alliance. The utilization of this subsidiary will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking of all business related to this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "TKCI may establish a subsidiary (the \"Holding Company\") for the purpose of conducting and developing business related to this alliance. The subsidiary's record keeping, reporting, and tracking of business will be handled as TKCI deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall establish' to 'may establish' makes the creation of the subsidiary optional. Furthermore, replacing 'will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking' with 'will be handled as TKCI deems appropriate' introduces ambiguity regarding the quality and method of these crucial functions. This may conflict with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that require accurate and transparent financial record-keeping, potentially violating securities regulations.",

Billie and Craig Talesman, or its other representatives, to TKCI will be complete, accurate and not misleading.",
                "changed_text": "SIC represents that the undersigned are authorized to execute this Agreement to the best of their knowledge, and that the information relating to SIC furnished by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman to TKCI will be believed to be accurate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'warrants' with 'represents' weakens the guarantee. The addition of 'to the best of their knowledge' and 'believed to be accurate' introduces subjectivity, making it more difficult to prove a breach of contract based on inaccurate information. This could conflict with Florida's contract law principles requiring a higher standard of accuracy and due diligence in representations and warranties.",

                "original_text": "Any disputes arising under or in connection with the validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement that cannot be resolved amicably by the parties shall be settled in arbitration before a single arbitrator. If arbitration fails to render a mutually agreement resolution the Courts of the State of Florida will be deemed to have jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising under or in connection with the validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement that cannot be resolved amicably by the parties may be submitted to arbitration. Should arbitration not provide a satisfactory resolution, the parties may consider other options.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be settled in arbitration' to 'may be submitted to arbitration' makes the arbitration process optional instead of mandatory. Removing the clause explicitly stating Florida courts will have jurisdiction leaves the jurisdictional issue unclear. This can conflict with Florida's arbitration laws, which favor enforcing mandatory arbitration agreements. It also contradicts standard legal practices that seek to avoid ambiguities in jurisdictional clauses.",

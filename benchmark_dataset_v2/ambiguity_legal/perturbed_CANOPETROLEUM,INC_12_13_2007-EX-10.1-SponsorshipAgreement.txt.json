                "changed_text": "The Company shall endeavor to produce approximately forty (40) episodes of the Show per year;",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall produce no less than forty' to 'shall endeavor to produce approximately forty' weakens the obligation. It introduces ambiguity as 'endeavor' and 'approximately' are subjective terms, making it difficult to enforce a specific number of episodes. This contradicts a clear expectation, making breach of contract arguments more complex.",

                "changed_text": "The Company agrees that Cano may place signage, of a reasonable size, at public appearances made by Honey Hole when mutually agreed upon, with consideration given to \"Kids Corner\" children's benefits.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear right to signage of a specific size at each public appearance. The modified version changes 'shall be entitled' to 'may place', introduces the vague concept of 'reasonable size', requires 'mutual agreement', and replaces 'including' with 'with consideration given to.' This makes Cano's right to signage discretionary and uncertain, contradicting the original agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall utilize' to 'will consider utilizing' weakens the obligation for the Company to use the provided promotional materials. This introduces uncertainty, as the Company now has discretion over whether to use Cano's materials. It also impacts whether Cano receives expected promotional benefits, making it difficult to argue breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "MP3.com agrees to deliver a guaranteed minimum of 3,000,000 Impressions per month for the term of this Agreement. An \"Impression\" is defined as the display of the Tickets Portal to a user on one of the above referenced pages.",
                "changed_text": "MP3.com will aim to deliver approximately 3,000,000 Impressions per month for the term of this Agreement. An \"Impression\" is defined as a potential display of the Tickets Portal to a user on one of the above-referenced pages.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to deliver a guaranteed minimum' to 'will aim to deliver approximately' weakens the commitment. Also, by changing \"display\" to \"potential display\" introduces uncertainty as to what constitutes an impression. This creates ambiguity because MP3.com can argue impressions that were not actually displayed to users count towards their obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires clear and definite terms in contracts (Cal. Civ. Code ยง 1644). The ambiguity makes enforcement difficult.",

                "changed_text": "Each party represents and warrants that its sites will endeavor not to: (i) knowingly infringe upon any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (ii) violate any law, statue, ordinance or regulation to the best of their understanding, including without limitation any laws regarding unfair competition, antidiscrimination or false advertising; (iii) be what is generally considered pornographic or obscene; (iv) be intentionally defamatory or trade libelous; or (v) contain viruses other harmful programming routines, to the best of its knowledge.",
                "explanation": "Adding qualifiers like 'endeavor,' 'knowingly,' 'to the best of their understanding,' 'generally considered,' and 'intentionally' significantly weaken the representations and warranties. This introduces subjective elements, creating ambiguity regarding what constitutes a breach. For instance, what one party 'knows' or 'understands' may differ from legal standards. 'What is generally considered pornographic' is open to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts California's strict liability standards for intellectual property infringement (copyrights, trademarks etc.) where knowledge or intent isn't always a requirement for a violation.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by Tickets without MP3.com's written consent, which shall be promptly granted or denied and not unreasonably withheld, except that Tickets may assign this Agreement without MP3.com's consent if another entity acquires substantially all the assets of Tickets.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may not be assigned by Tickets without MP3.com's consent, which shall be considered. Tickets may assign this Agreement without MP3.com's consent if another entity appears to acquire most of the assets of Tickets.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'promptly granted or denied and not unreasonably withheld' gives MP3.com broad discretion to deny consent without justification. Additionally, changing 'substantially all the assets' to 'appears to acquire most of the assets' introduces ambiguity by replacing a relatively clear standard with a subjective assessment of whether an acquisition 'appears' to meet a threshold of 'most' assets, which isn't clearly defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "This may violate California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Com. Code ยง 1203), which requires parties to act honestly and fairly in exercising contractual discretion. Making the assignment clause too restrictive could be viewed as violating that covenant.",

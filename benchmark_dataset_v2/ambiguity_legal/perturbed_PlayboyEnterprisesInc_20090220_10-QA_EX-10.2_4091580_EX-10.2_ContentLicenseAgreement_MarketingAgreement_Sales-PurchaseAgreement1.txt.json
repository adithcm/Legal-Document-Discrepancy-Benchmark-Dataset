                "original_text": "Throughout the Term, EFS shall be solely responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all applicable international, federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, industry guidelines and similar restrictions (collectively, \"Laws\") in connection with operation of the Playboy Commerce Business. EFS shall be responsible for monitoring such Laws and taking any actions necessary to keep compliant all aspects of the Playboy Commerce Business, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Policy (as defined in Section 5.1(a)), as well as best practices relating to Direct Marketing Association (\"DMA\") Guidelines (as they relate to the DMA Privacy Promise, pander files, etc.).",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the Term, EFS shall endeavor to be aware of and comply with applicable international, federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, industry guidelines, and similar restrictions (collectively, \"Laws\") in connection with the operation of the Playboy Commerce Business. EFS will attempt to monitor such Laws and take actions it considers appropriate to maintain general compliance of the Playboy Commerce Business, including the Privacy Policy (as defined in Section 5.1(a)), as well as consider best practices relating to Direct Marketing Association (\"DMA\") Guidelines (as they relate to the DMA Privacy Promise, pander files, etc.).",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall be solely responsible' with 'shall endeavor to be aware of,' making the level of responsibility unclear. 'Taking any actions necessary to keep compliant' is replaced with 'take actions it considers appropriate to maintain general compliance,' introducing subjectivity and allowing for potentially insufficient measures. This could lead to non-compliance with various consumer protection laws, data privacy regulations, or advertising standards.",

EFS shall implement a privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") applicable to users of the Websites and the Catalogs that is no less protective of user privacy than is required under the Laws of or otherwise applicable to the Territory. Such Privacy Policy shall be prominently displayed, as is customary in the industry, within the Websites and the Catalogs and be easily accessible to users. EFS shall not take any action, and shall not operate the Websites or the Catalogs, in contravention of such Privacy Policy or of any applicable Law, including, but not limited to, data protection provisions imposed by the United Sates, the European Union or the other countries of the Territory and other applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "EFS should display a terms of use policy (\"TOU\") on the Websites, which should aim to comply with applicable Laws and should generally prohibit orders from customers under eighteen (18) years of age (or the applicable age of majority) and briefly explain EFS' purchasing and return policies. EFS should implement a privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") applicable to users of the Websites and the Catalogs. Such Privacy Policy should be displayed within the Websites and the Catalogs and be generally accessible to users. EFS will try not to take any action, and will attempt not to operate the Websites or the Catalogs, in contradiction of such Privacy Policy or of any applicable Law, including data protection provisions.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific compliance requirements. The modified text weakens these mandates. 'Shall prominently display' becomes 'should display,' 'shall comply with all applicable Laws' becomes 'should aim to comply,' and 'prohibits orders' becomes 'should generally prohibit orders.' 'Shall not take any action...in contravention of such Privacy Policy or of any applicable Law' is replaced with the much weaker, 'will try not to take any action, and will attempt not to operate...in contradiction.' This creates significant ambiguity about EFS's actual legal obligation and how strictly it must adhere to privacy and consumer protection laws.",

The Merchandise will generally conform to Laws governing design, quality, labeling, and safety and will try not to violate the rights of third parties.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'hereby warrants and agrees that' to 'represents that' and inserting qualifiers like 'should generally meet,' 'will try to avoid,' and 'will consider,' the binding obligations become aspirational statements. Removing the strict mandate to 'destroy' non-conforming goods, and replacing 'shall conform to and comply with' to 'will generally conform to' creates ambiguity regarding product compliance and consumer safety, as the laws are there to protect consumers and require a certain standard from retailers and manufacturers.",

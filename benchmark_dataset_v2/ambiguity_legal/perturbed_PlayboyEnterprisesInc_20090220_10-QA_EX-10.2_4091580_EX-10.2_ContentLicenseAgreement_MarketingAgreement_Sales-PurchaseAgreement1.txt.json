                "explanation": "The phrases 'endeavor to be aware,' 'may monitor,' 'consider taking actions,' and 'potentially including' introduce ambiguity. The original text mandates responsibility and compliance, while the modified version makes these actions discretionary.

EFS shall deliver to Client, upon execution of the Agreement, certificates of insurance as evidence of the required coverages. EFS agrees that these policies shall not be canceled or materially changed without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Client. Such notice shall include written confirmation and details of replacement insurance coverages and other material revisions to the policies, which shall be effective immediately upon any cancellation or material change in EFS' policies in order that no gap in coverage results.",

EFS will provide certificates of insurance to Client. EFS will try to provide thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Client if these policies are canceled or changed.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall maintain' with 'should attempt to maintain', and 'shall name' with 'may name as deemed appropriate', the obligation to maintain specific insurance coverages and naming Client as additional insured becomes discretionary. The modifications of 'combined single limit of not less than' to 'which the parties will discuss', 'Workers’ compensation insurance in statutory amounts' to 'possibly covering', and 'in an amount not less than' to 'to be determined' creates significant ambiguity around the level and type of coverage required. Further changing ‘shall be carried’ to ‘should be carried’ provides further ambiguity in the statement. The phrase ‘will try to provide’ weakens the notification requirement for changes to the policy. This contradicts standard business practices and legal expectations for adequate insurance coverage, potentially violating state-specific **insurance laws** and creating significant liability risks for Playboy.",

                "explanation": "The changes from 'agrees that all...shall be approved' to 'will attempt to have...approved' significantly weakens the requirement for model approval. Similarly, changing 'shall be Playmates...as requested by the Client' to 'may consider using Playmates...based on availability and cost' makes the use of specific models discretionary and subject to other factors. By removing ‘mutually agreed in advance in writing by the parties’ in favor of ‘unless otherwise discussed’, the parties do not need to come to a written agreement to forego this obligation. The introduction of 'availability and cost' as determining factors introduces further ambiguity. This could violate clauses within the agreement that require brand maintenance, and may lead to disputes over the implied brand image and marketing standards.",

                "original_text": "mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of          this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and          specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent          Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be          updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well          as the guidelines provided herein.",
                "changed_text": "mPhase shall generally consider the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and specifications, and the review process related to the use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase acknowledges that these guidelines may be updated from time to time and will endeavor to align with these updates, as practically feasible.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to abide by' with 'shall generally consider' and 'will endeavor to align with, as practically feasible' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance with the guidelines in Schedule B discretionary. This could be interpreted as not requiring strict adherence to the specifications, requirements, and review process.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles of 'good faith and fair dealing', which require parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of contracts. Ambiguity may lead to disputes regarding whether mPhase acted in good faith, especially regarding the Schedule B guidelines.",

                "changed_text": "Lucent acknowledges a general understanding of the typical quality of mPhase's Goods. mPhase will attempt to ensure the quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo is somewhat similar to past qualities of their Goods.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to maintain the quality' to 'will attempt to ensure the quality is somewhat similar' weakens the obligation. 'Somewhat similar' is vague and subjective, making it difficult to enforce a specific quality standard. The definition of 'typical quality' from Lucent is also vague, since Lucent 'acknowledges a general understanding'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract; New Jersey law requires specificity and clarity in contractual obligations. Lack of a defined standard may invalidate the clause or lead to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "mPhase will allow Lucent reasonable opportunities to request access to view the Approved Uses bearing the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. The primary intention of these access requests will be to collaborate on continuous improvement regarding compliance with this Agreement and the procedures within Schedule B.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the obligation to allow inspections. 'Reasonable opportunities to request access' is less direct than 'agrees to allow Lucent to inspect'. Further, changing the stated intention of the inspections to 'collaborate on continuous improvement' rather than 'ensure compliance' creates an impression of non-stringent enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract - the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing that exist within New York law may be violated. By hindering the ability of Lucent to inspect, MPhase is in bad faith because now they can prevent Lucent from having a proper inspection of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo.",

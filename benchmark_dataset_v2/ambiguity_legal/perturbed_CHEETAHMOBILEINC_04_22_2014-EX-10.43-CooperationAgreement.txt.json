Party A also agrees to participate in the \"Blue Sky 365\" Action Plan and comply with Blue Sky 365 Action Plan Regulations (see Annex 4).",
                "changed_text": "Party A should endeavor to align its practices with the Business Cooperation Standard of Baidu Union available at http://union.baidu.com/regAgreement.html (see Annex 3). Party A may participate in the \"Blue Sky 365\" Action Plan and should consider adhering to the general principles of the Blue Sky 365 Action Plan Regulations (see Annex 4).",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the legally binding nature of Party A's commitment to the Business Cooperation Standard and the \"Blue Sky 365\" Action Plan. Replacing \"undertakes to comply\" with \"should endeavor to align\" and \"agrees to participate and comply\" with \"may participate and should consider adhering to the general principles\" introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory.",

                "explanation": "The modification weakens Party B's warranty regarding intellectual property ownership by changing \"warrants that it legally owns\" to \"represents that it believes it owns\". The shift from \"shall be borne by Party B\" to \"may be considered for coverage by Party B\" introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation to cover losses discretionary, instead of a guaranteed obligation.",

In the event that Party A objects the payment from Party B, it shall propose within the first 5 working days in each month in writing, or it will be deemed as no objection. Party B shall review within three working days upon receipt of Party A's written objection and notify the results thereof to Party A.",

If Party A has concerns regarding the payment, it should notify Party B in a timely fashion. Party B will make a reasonable effort to review such concerns.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a specific time frame with a 'warrant'. The perturbed text changes this to 'may provide an invoice for the share of revenues in the preceding month within a reasonable time frame', and changes 'Party B warrants to pay the share of revenues to Party A prior to the 20t h day of each month' to 'Party B will endeavor to pay the share of revenues to Party A approximately by the 20th day of each month, subject to internal processing times'. 'Reasonable' and 'approximately' add ambiguity and uncertainty around the actual payment deadlines. This also affects the objection procedures. The new sentence 'If Party A has concerns regarding the payment, it should notify Party B in a timely fashion.' replaces 'In the event that Party A objects the payment from Party B, it shall propose within the first 5 working days in each month in writing, or it will be deemed as no objection.'",

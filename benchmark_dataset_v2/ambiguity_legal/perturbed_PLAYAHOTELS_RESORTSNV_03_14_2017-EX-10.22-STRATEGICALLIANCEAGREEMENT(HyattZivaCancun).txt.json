                "original_text": "If the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party's possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "changed_text": "If the Offering Party is generally expected to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party may deliver a notice to the Receiving Party, along with potentially relevant due diligence information if readily available, to assist the Receiving Party in considering the Development Opportunity (referred to as the \"Consideration Communication\"). The Receiving Party should endeavor to communicate its interest within a reasonable timeframe after receiving the Consideration Communication.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states a mandatory requirement for the Offering Party to provide an Offer Notice with due diligence information. The modified text replaces 'is required to' with 'is generally expected to,' making the obligation discretionary. It also replaces 'must deliver written notice' with 'may deliver a notice,' further weakening the requirement. The 'reasonable timeframe' is ambiguous, contradicting the original 'ten (10) business days.' This could be problematic under contract law, as it makes the obligation unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear and definite terms for enforceability; specifically, the requirement of 'consideration' and 'mutuality of obligation' which is undermined by the ambiguous language.",

                "original_text": "Any notice required under this Agreement to be given by either Party to the other Party shall be in writing in the English language. Any required notice shall be effective two business days after it is sent by a recognized international courier service to the address of the other Party stated in this Agreement, or such other address as shall be notified to the other Party in writing, and any receipt issued by the courier service shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and date of sending of any such notice.",
                "changed_text": "Any notice under this Agreement should preferably be in writing in the English language. A notice might be considered effective a few days after dispatch via a potentially reliable delivery method to the other Party's indicated address, or a reasonably updated address, with delivery confirmation serving as possible evidence of transmission.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear requirement for written notice via international courier, with a specified timeframe for effectiveness and conclusive evidence of sending. The modified text weakens this by using 'should preferably be,' 'might be considered,' 'potentially reliable,' 'reasonably updated,' and 'possible evidence.' This introduces ambiguity around the form, delivery method, effectiveness, and proof of sending. This contradicts the legal requirements for providing notice in many jurisdictions, where specificity is often necessary for legal validity.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear and unambiguous terms for notice provisions; potentially contradicts laws regarding proper notification in legal proceedings which often require specific methods and proof of delivery.",

                "original_text": "The prevailing Party in any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing Party in connection with such arbitration (including any actions to enforce any award(s) or any of the provisions of this Section 5). If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s).",
                "changed_text": "The apparently prevailing Party in any arbitration relating to this Agreement may seek to recover some fees, costs, and expenses from the other Party, possibly including enforcement actions. If a Party seems to have partially prevailed, they might recover a somewhat fair amount of fees, costs, and expenses, subject to the arbitrator's interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the prevailing party is 'entitled to recover' reasonable fees. The modified text changes this to 'may seek to recover,' 'some fees,' and 'possibly including.' It also replaces 'equitable amount' with 'somewhat fair amount' and adds 'subject to the arbitrator's interpretation,' making the right to recover fees uncertain and dependent on subjective interpretation. This could be problematic in jurisdictions where clear fee-shifting provisions are standard, as it introduces significant ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear and unambiguous terms; undermines the principle of fee-shifting where statutes or agreements explicitly award attorney's fees to the prevailing party.",

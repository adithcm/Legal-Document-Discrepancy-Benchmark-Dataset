                "original_text": "5.1 Without derogating from CBC's representations and warranties herein, CBC and MediWound shall work together in order to enable the CBC facility to accomplish all required standards, related to the manufacturing, packaging and delivering of Bromelain SP in accordance with the Specifications, GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice) and cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, ISO 22000 and all other applicable laws and regulations. For such purpose, and without derogating from other terms herein, CBC shall permit MediWound, and/or a consultant on MediWound's behalf, to access and inspect the CBC facility and advise MediWound and/or CBC on such actions to be taken for accomplishing such compliance. Such mutual regulatory preparations shall begin no later than the finalization of MediWound's current phase III clinical trial.\n\nCBC warrants and represents that all Bromelain SP shall be manufactured and supplied in compliance with the Specifications, quality control methods and test methods, all applicable SOP's and all applicable laws, and in accordance with GACP, cGMP, including the relevant guidelines, policies, codes, requirements, regulations, approvals and/or standards from time to time promulgated or issued by any relevant governmental and/or regulatory authority which relate to the manufacture of the Bromelain SP to be used for the production of a pharmaceutical agent as the Product.\n\nCBC warrants further that CBC has, and will for the duration of this Agreement retain, all applicable regulatory approvals required for the carrying out of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation the manufacturing, packaging and supply of the Bromelain SP.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Without derogating from CBC's representations and warranties herein, CBC and MediWound may collaborate to enable the CBC facility to generally align with the required standards, related to the manufacturing, packaging, and delivering of Bromelain SP, acknowledging GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice) and cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, ISO 22000, and other applicable laws and regulations. For such purpose, CBC may allow MediWound, and/or a consultant on MediWound's behalf, access to generally inspect the CBC facility and provide suggestions on actions for accomplishing compliance. Such regulatory preparations will begin sometime after MediWound's current phase III clinical trial.\n\nCBC represents that all Bromelain SP will be manufactured and supplied generally in line with the Specifications, quality control methods, and test methods, and other applicable laws, acknowledging GACP and cGMP, including guidelines issued by any relevant governmental and/or regulatory authority which relate to the manufacture of the Bromelain SP to be used for the production of a pharmaceutical agent as the Product.\n\nCBC represents further that CBC has, and will make reasonable efforts for the duration of this Agreement to retain, applicable regulatory approvals required for the carrying out of its obligations hereunder, including the manufacturing, packaging and supply of the Bromelain SP.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguities by replacing definitive obligations with vague terms. 'Shall work together' becomes 'may collaborate,' implying optional cooperation. 'In accordance with' becomes 'generally align with,' weakening the compliance standard. 'Shall permit' becomes 'may allow', which creates optionality. 'All applicable regulatory approvals' becomes 'applicable regulatory approvals' and includes 'reasonable efforts'. These changes make CBC's responsibilities less strict and harder to enforce.",

If CBC wishes to make changes to the Specifications, the production and/or packaging batch records, the SOPs related to the Bromelain SP, or the design of the manufacturing process or any other change during production which would effect the quality of the Bromelain SP or of the Product and/or otherwise would effect the Bromelain SP in any way or which might effect the regulatory approvals of the Product, then CBC shall (i) notify MediWound in writing at least 6 months in advance regarding such proposed changes, and (ii) represent that such change will not adversely effect the quality of the Bromelain SP or of the Product in any way, and (iii) not make such changes without MediWound's prior written approval, and (iv) will assure that such change will not delay or in any way effect any open orders for Bromelain SP.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Manufacturing, packaging, and labeling activities done at CBC will generally follow the pre-approved batch records. If CBC considers making changes to the Specifications, the production and/or packaging batch records, the SOPs related to the Bromelain SP, or the design of the manufacturing process or any other change during production which might potentially affect the quality of the Bromelain SP or of the Product or the regulatory approvals of the Product, then CBC will endeavor to (i) notify MediWound in writing sometime in advance regarding such proposed changes, and (ii) indicate whether such change is likely to adversely affect the quality of the Bromelain SP or of the Product in any way, and (iii) aim not to make such changes without MediWound's written approval, and (iv) try to assure that such change will not delay or in any way affect any open orders for Bromelain SP.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will be performed according to' with 'will generally follow,' loosening the requirement for adherence to pre-approved batch records. 'If CBC wishes to make changes' is replaced with 'If CBC considers making changes' making the change discretionary. 'Shall notify' is replaced with 'will endeavor to notify', 'represent' is replaced with 'indicate whether such change is likely', 'not make such changes' with 'aim not to make such changes', and 'will assure' with 'try to assure'. This reduces the obligation of CBC to adhere to strict change control procedures and introduces subjectivity.",

Such records shall include, but not be limited to, all records required by applicable laws and regulations, of the territories in which the Product is marketed and sold. MediWound (itself or through anyone on its behalf) or any relevant regulatory authority shall have the right to audit any such records and/or the relevant facilities of CBC (or any facilities of any CBC third party or subcontractor involved in the manufacture, quality control and/or supply of the Bromelain SP) with reasonable prior notice, during regular business hours, including the right to ask CBC to provide any relevant documents.

CBC will try to inform MediWound of announced regulatory inspections that directly involve the Bromelain SP or the Product soon after the notification to CBC of such an inspection.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces ambiguity by changing 'undertakes to keep all records reasonably required by MediWound' to 'will endeavor to keep records ... as deemed reasonably necessary by CBC', shifting the determination of necessary records from MediWound to CBC. 'Shall have the right to audit' becomes 'may request to audit', weakening MediWound's oversight. 'Shall inform' becomes 'will try to inform', making the notification of inspections non-mandatory and discretionary.",

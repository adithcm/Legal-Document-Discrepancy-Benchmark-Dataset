                "original_text": "5.1 Without derogating from CBC's representations and warranties herein, CBC and MediWound shall work together in order to enable the CBC facility to accomplish all required standards, related to the manufacturing, packaging and delivering of Bromelain SP in accordance with the Specifications, GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice) and cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, ISO 22000 and all other applicable laws and regulations. For such purpose, and without derogating from other terms herein, CBC shall permit MediWound, and/or a consultant on MediWound's behalf, to access and inspect the CBC facility and advise MediWound and/or CBC on such actions to be taken for accomplishing such compliance. Such mutual regulatory preparations shall begin no later than the finalization of MediWound's current phase III clinical trial. CBC warrants and represents that all Bromelain SP shall be manufactured and supplied in compliance with the Specifications, quality control methods and test methods, all applicable SOP's and all applicable laws, and in accordance with GACP, cGMP, including the relevant guidelines, policies, codes, requirements, regulations, approvals and/or standards from time to time promulgated or issued by any relevant governmental and/or regulatory authority which relate to the manufacture of the Bromelain SP to be used for the production of a pharmaceutical agent as the Product. CBC warrants further that CBC has, and will for the duration of this Agreement retain, all applicable regulatory approvals required for the carrying out of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation the manufacturing, packaging and supply of the Bromelain SP.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Without derogating from CBC's representations and warranties herein, CBC and MediWound should attempt to work together to enable the CBC facility to generally align with required standards related to manufacturing, packaging, and delivering Bromelain SP. These standards include Specifications, GACP, cGMP standards, ISO 22000, and other applicable laws and regulations. CBC will allow MediWound, or a consultant on their behalf, to access and inspect the facility to advise on actions that may be taken. Mutual regulatory preparations may begin around the finalization of MediWound's current phase III clinical trial. CBC aims to manufacture and supply Bromelain SP in general alignment with the Specifications, quality control methods, test methods, applicable SOP's, and applicable laws. CBC intends to retain all generally applicable regulatory approvals required to carry out its obligations.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the legal obligation to meet specific standards. Replacing 'shall work together' with 'should attempt to work together', 'in accordance with' to 'generally align with', and the addition of 'aims to' and 'intends to' makes compliance discretionary and vague, rather than mandatory. The removal of the explicit warranty that all Bromelain SP will be manufactured in compliance, replaces it with a weaker intention to align, which creates significant ambiguity. This could lead to disputes regarding whether CBC has met its obligations.",

                "original_text": "5.4 CBC undertakes to keep all records reasonably required by MediWound relating to the manufacture, quality control and testing of Bromelain SP. Such records shall include, but not be limited to, all records required by applicable laws and regulations, of the territories in which the Product is marketed and sold. MediWound (itself or through anyone on its behalf) or any relevant regulatory authority shall have the right to audit any such records and/or the relevant facilities of CBC (or any facilities of any CBC third party or subcontractor involved in the manufacture, quality control and/or supply of the Bromelain SP) with reasonable prior notice, during regular business hours, including the right to ask CBC to provide any relevant documents. CBC shall inform MediWound of any announced regulatory inspections that directly involve the Bromelain SP or the Product within 48 hours of the notification to CBC of such an inspection.",
                "changed_text": "5.4 CBC will endeavor to maintain records relating to the manufacture, quality control, and testing of Bromelain SP as it deems appropriate. MediWound or a relevant regulatory authority may request an audit of such records and/or the facilities of CBC with what CBC considers reasonable prior notice, during business hours that CBC finds convenient, including the opportunity to request documents CBC is willing to share. CBC will try to inform MediWound of regulatory inspections involving Bromelain SP as soon as practically possible.",
                "explanation": "The modified wording introduces significant ambiguity and discretion for CBC in record keeping, auditing, and communication of regulatory inspections. 'Endeavor to maintain records' reduces the obligation to maintain records, 'as it deems appropriate' allows CBC to decide what is necessary, and replacing 'reasonable prior notice' with 'what CBC considers reasonable prior notice', as well as ‘try to inform MediWound’ makes it much more subjective.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 11 (Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures) requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to maintain accurate and complete records and data, as well as to provide audit trails.",

In such event MediWound shall, at MediWound's sole discretion, determine whether to recall or withdraw the Product from the market.",
                "changed_text": "5.8.2 If CBC has a general sense that the Bromelain SP or one or more Products might need recall, CBC should consider notifying MediWound. MediWound retains the option to decide whether a recall is necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'has any reason to believe' with 'has a general sense', 'shall immediately notify' with 'should consider notifying', removes the obligation to immediately report a recall, and makes it more vague. This change introduces ambiguity regarding the circumstances under which CBC must notify MediWound of potential recalls, creating uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 7 (Enforcement Policy) requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to promptly report potential safety issues and recalls to the FDA.",

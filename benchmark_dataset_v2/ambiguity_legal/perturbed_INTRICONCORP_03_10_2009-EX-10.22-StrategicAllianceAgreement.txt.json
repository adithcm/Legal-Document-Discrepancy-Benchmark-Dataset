                "original_text": "Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost:\n(a) obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise, and comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the exercise of, its license rights under this Agreement; and\n(b) comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times with any technical standards as may reasonably be required by law, and any licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Patent Partnership (HIMPP), it being acknowledged that Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.",
                "changed_text": "Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost:\n(a) use reasonable efforts to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals; and\n(b) make an attempt to comply with technical standards and licensing requirements, but Dynamic Hearing offers no guarantees for compliance. Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals' to 'use reasonable efforts to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals' and 'comply, and ensure that all Products comply' to 'make an attempt to comply with technical standards and licensing requirements, but Dynamic Hearing offers no guarantees for compliance'. The terms 'reasonable efforts' and 'make an attempt' are vague and do not clearly define the level of effort required, contradicting the original obligation to ensure full compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Failure to obtain and maintain all necessary governmental and regulatory approvals and ensure full compliance with technical standards and licensing requirements could result in violations of Australian Consumer Law and Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 if products are sold in Australia, as well as other applicable international regulations depending on where the products are sold.",

                "original_text": "IntriCon must keep accurate and complete records of orders received, Base Product Units / DSP Features/Modules Sold and returned and all other records reasonably necessary to substantiate all Royalty Payments to be made to Dynamic Hearing under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "IntriCon will keep records of orders received, Base Product Units / DSP Features/Modules Sold and returned, and other records as they deem necessary to track Royalty Payments made to Dynamic Hearing under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'accurate and complete records of orders received...and all other records reasonably necessary to substantiate all Royalty Payments' with 'records of orders received...and other records as they deem necessary to track Royalty Payments,' the obligation to maintain comprehensive and verifiable records is weakened. The term 'as they deem necessary' introduces subjectivity, potentially leading to incomplete or inadequate record-keeping. The change is ambiguous and contradicts the need for a transparent and auditable system for royalty calculations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could lead to a breach of general accounting principles and potentially violate contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing, as it allows IntriCon to unilaterally decide what records are sufficient, which can unfairly impact Dynamic Hearing's ability to verify royalty payments.",

                "original_text": "Each party must not disclose any part of this Agreement to any person without the prior written consent of the other party.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should endeavor not to disclose any part of this Agreement to any person without the prior written consent of the other party.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'must not disclose' to 'should endeavor not to disclose' significantly weakens the confidentiality obligation. 'Should endeavor' implies a non-binding recommendation rather than a strict prohibition. This creates ambiguity regarding the enforceability of the confidentiality clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Weakening the confidentiality clause could undermine trade secret protection and contractual obligations related to confidential information. Depending on the specific information disclosed, this could potentially violate laws regarding the protection of proprietary information. This change undermines the legal protection afforded to confidential information under contract and intellectual property law.",

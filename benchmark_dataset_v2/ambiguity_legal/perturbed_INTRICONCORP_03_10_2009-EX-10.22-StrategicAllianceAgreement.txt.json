                "changed_text": "IntriCon will consider, at its discretion, whether to comply with the request for HIMPP compliance.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will use its best efforts' to 'will consider, at its discretion' introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation non-mandatory. This weakens the commitment to HIMPP (Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association) compliance, potentially leading to non-compliance and disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Failure to comply with HIMPP standards could hinder market access in regions where such compliance is a regulatory requirement, conflicting with trade regulations.",

                "changed_text": "IntriCon will, based on available resources:\n\n       (a)    endeavor to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals deemed necessary for it to exercise, and attempt to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the exercise of its license rights under this Agreement; and\n\n       (b)    strive to ensure that Products meet technical standards possibly required by law, and licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Patent Partnership (HIMPP).",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'will endeavor/strive to' and adding qualifiers like 'deemed necessary' and 'possibly required' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. This can be interpreted as IntriCon having the discretion to decide which approvals and standards are necessary, conflicting with mandatory regulatory requirements. Additionally, removing 'at its cost' introduces further ambiguity regarding who bears the cost of compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals directly violates mandatory compliance requirements in various jurisdictions, contravening regulations like those set by the FDA (in the US) or the TGA (in Australia) for medical devices.",

                "changed_text": "IntriCon should maintain records of orders received, Base Product Units / DSP Features/Modules Sold and returned as generally understood to be relevant for Royalty Payments to Dynamic Hearing under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must keep accurate and complete records' to 'should maintain records...as generally understood to be relevant' weakens the obligation, introducing subjectivity. The term 'generally understood' is vague and does not provide a clear standard for record-keeping, opening it up to interpretation and potential disputes. This is contradictory to standard accounting practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "This undermines the precise accounting required for royalty payments, potentially violating laws related to accurate financial reporting and contract enforcement.",

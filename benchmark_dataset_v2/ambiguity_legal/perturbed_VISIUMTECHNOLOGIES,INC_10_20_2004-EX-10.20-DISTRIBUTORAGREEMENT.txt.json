                "explanation": "By changing 'must provide' to 'will endeavor to provide,' the obligation becomes discretionary. The replacement of 'weekly' with 'periodic' and removing 'every' introduces ambiguity regarding the frequency and completeness of the reports.

Power2Ship is required to keep all the WLI Unit activations on every wireless network on a separate account from any other vendor's brand used by Power2Ship. Every such monthly invoice (one per operator) must be submitted to WLI within 7 days from the date it is received by Power2Ship and the invoice must include all pages listed on the invoice (example 7of 7 pages).

The invoice should generally be submitted within a reasonable timeframe. Power2Ship’s officers will attempt to confirm the account numbers.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must provide' to 'should attempt to provide' makes providing the airtime bill optional, and replacing 'is required to' with 'may' makes keeping the activations on a separate account discretionary. Replacing 'must be submitted within 7 days' with 'should generally be submitted within a reasonable timeframe' makes the submission deadline vague. This contradicts standard accounting practices and the need for accurate billing, making audits challenging and creating financial discrepancies. Similarly, changing ‘must confirm’ to ‘will attempt to confirm’ weakens the obligation of officers.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use its reasonable efforts' to 'may attempt to' weakens the obligation to deliver on time. Replacing 'will use its reasonable efforts to notify' with 'might notify' makes the notification of delays discretionary. This introduces uncertainty about WLI's commitment to timely delivery and communication, potentially violating basic contract law principles regarding delivery obligations. Also, changing the sentence to include `around` creates an ambiguity in the agreement regarding the date that delivery can happen.",

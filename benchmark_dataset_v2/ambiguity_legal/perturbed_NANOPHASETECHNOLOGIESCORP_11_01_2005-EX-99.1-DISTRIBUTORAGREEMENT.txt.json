                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "ALFA AESAR hereby accepts such right and agrees to use its reasonable efforts to promote the marketing, sale and distribution of Research Quantities of the Products throughout the Territory in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement using normal and standard practices.",
                "changed_text": "ALFA AESAR hereby accepts such right and agrees to attempt to promote the marketing, sale, and distribution of Research Quantities of the Products throughout the Territory, as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'attempt to promote...as it deems appropriate' introduces significant ambiguity regarding the level of effort required by ALFA AESAR. This contradicts the initial agreement to use 'reasonable efforts' and removes the requirement to adhere to 'normal and standard practices,' making their promotional obligations vague and discretionary. This ambiguity creates uncertainty regarding the distributor's actual commitment to marketing the products.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms in agreements. The ambiguity introduced could render the obligation unenforceable due to lack of clarity, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing often applied in commercial contracts.",

                "changed_text": "ALFA AESAR may buy the Products in quantities it considers necessary and repackage them as it sees fit for distribution and sale, with a general understanding of safety.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a relatively defined obligation with a vague and discretionary one. 'May buy the Products in quantities it considers necessary' removes the requirement to adhere to Schedule A. 'Repackage them as it sees fit' removes the 'as it deems reasonable and appropriate' and creates a complete ambiguity and introduces uncertainty, and 'general understanding of safety' is also an ambiguity, replacing 'shall comply with applicable safety laws and regulations.' This contradicts requirements for proper labeling, handling, and safety data sheets mandated by regulations like OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200).",
                "contradicted_law": "OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) and related state-level 'Right to Know' laws, which mandate specific requirements for labeling, safety data sheets (SDS), and training for hazardous chemicals.",

                "original_text": "ALFA AESAR agrees not to manufacture, buy, sell, distribute, deal in or be the agent for any products with the specifications of any of the Products, excluding any preexisting ALFA AESAR products.",
                "changed_text": "ALFA AESAR will generally avoid manufacturing, buying, selling, distributing, dealing in, or acting as an agent for products similar to the Products, except for its existing product lines.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the non-compete clause by replacing 'agrees not to' with 'will generally avoid,' making the restriction discretionary. The term 'similar to' is also vague compared to 'with the specifications of,' creating a loophole for ALFA AESAR to engage in activities that directly compete with NTC's products. This ambiguity undermines the purpose of the non-compete clause, potentially allowing ALFA AESAR to market competing products under the guise of 'not being exactly the same' as NTC's. This shift could contradict the principle of clear and enforceable non-compete agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Enforceability standards for non-compete agreements, which require them to be clearly defined and not overly broad. The added ambiguity may make this clause more difficult to enforce under state laws governing non-compete agreements, such as those requiring reasonable restrictions on scope and duration.",

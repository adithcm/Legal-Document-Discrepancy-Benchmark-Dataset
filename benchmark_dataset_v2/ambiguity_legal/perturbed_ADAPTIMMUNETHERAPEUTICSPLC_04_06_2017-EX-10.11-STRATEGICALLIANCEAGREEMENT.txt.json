                "original_text": "MD Anderson shall and will ensure that each Principal Investigator shall conduct a Study in accordance with (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Study Order, (b) the provisions of the Protocol or workscope, as applicable, (c) applicable Good Clinical Practice requirements as incorporated by FDA regulations (\"GCP\"), (d) the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as applicable, and (e) any and all applicable orders and mandates of relevant authorities (including the FDA) and IRB, and applicable MD Anderson policies.",
                "changed_text": "MD Anderson should endeavor to ensure that each Principal Investigator conducts a Study in general alignment with (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Study Order, (b) the provisions of the Protocol or workscope, as applicable, (c) Good Clinical Practice considerations as generally understood, (d) broad ethical principles, and (e) relevant guidance from authorities and IRB, and applicable MD Anderson practices.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation from a strict 'shall' to a discretionary 'should endeavor' and replaces 'in accordance with' to 'in general alignment'. The removal of 'applicable' before Good Clinical Practice and changing 'requirements' to 'considerations', replaces 'ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as applicable' with 'broad ethical principles' creates ambiguity, undermining the enforceability of these standards. This introduces ambiguity and makes compliance less certain, as precise compliance with regulatory standards is no longer explicitly required.",

                "original_text": "Prior to participation of each subject in a Clinical Study, MD Anderson will ensure that (a) it has obtained a signed written informed consent document from the subject (\"Consent\") and (b) it has obtained a signed, written, HIPAA authorization that adequately discloses the circumstances under which the subject's personal data might be disclosed, as applicable, and documents the subject's express written authorization for use and disclosure of the subject's PHI for Study purposes, as applicable, pursuant to the HIPAA regulations (\"Authorization\"). MD Anderson will agree to the contents of any Consent or Authorization provided to any Study patient or prospective Study patient with Adaptimmune prior to use in any Clinical Study.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to participation of each subject in a Clinical Study, MD Anderson will attempt to obtain a consent document from the subject (\"Consent\") and may also seek a HIPAA authorization that discusses the circumstances under which the subject's personal data might be disclosed. MD Anderson will generally align with the spirit of any Consent or Authorization discussed with Adaptimmune prior to use in any Clinical Study.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will ensure that' to 'will attempt to obtain' regarding informed consent, makes obtaining consent discretionary rather than mandatory. Removing the 'written' requirement makes it unclear what format consent should take. Replacing 'HIPAA authorization that adequately discloses' to 'HIPAA authorization that discusses', weakens the requirement to fully and transparently disclose PHI usage. Also the term 'express written authorization for use and disclosure of the subject's PHI for Study purposes' removed and replaced with 'documents the subject's express written authorization for use and disclosure of the subject's PHI for Study purposes, as applicable'. Also the term 'agree to contents' replaces with 'generally align with the spirit of'. This significantly weakens the legal obligation for obtaining proper informed consent and HIPAA authorization, creating potential for unauthorized use and disclosure of protected health information.",

In relation to Pre-Clinical Studies, oral reports or interim written status reports of the progress of the Studies will be provided by the Principal Investigator to Adaptimmune on a regular basis and at least once every *** (***) months during the course of a Study. Significant developments arising out of Studies will be communicated promptly to Adaptimmune. In the context of any Clinical Study, MD Anderson shall timely prepare and submit to Adaptimmune (a) case report forms, as soon as reasonably possible but in any event within *** (***) business days following completion of any Study patient visit; and (b) responses to data resolution queries as soon as reasonably possible and in any event within *** (***) business days following receipt of such query.",
                "changed_text": "In relation to Clinical Studies, MD Anderson will attempt to keep Adaptimmune generally updated on the Study progress and may respond to queries of Adaptimmune related to the Study. In relation to Pre-Clinical Studies, the Principal Investigator may provide oral reports or informal status updates to Adaptimmune as deemed appropriate, but not necessarily at regular intervals. Important developments may be communicated. In any Clinical Study, MD Anderson will endeavor to submit case report forms and data query responses when practical.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the mandatory nature of reporting study progress and submitting data. Changing 'will keep reasonably informed' to 'will attempt to keep generally updated' introduces ambiguity, and removing 'promptly' weakens the timeliness requirement. Also changing the statement of 'will be provided by the principal investigator' to 'may provide...as deemed appropriate' provides a non-binding and vague structure for the agreement. Removing the specific timelines for case report forms and data query responses, and replacing them with 'endeavor to submit...when practical', makes it unclear when these should be submitted. This hinders effective monitoring of the study and may violate data integrity requirements.",

                "original_text": "MD Anderson shall and will ensure that each Principal Investigator shall conduct a Study in accordance with (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Study Order, (b) the provisions of the Protocol or workscope, as applicable, (c) applicable Good Clinical Practice requirements as incorporated by FDA regulations (\"GCP\"), (d) the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as applicable, and (e) any and all applicable orders and mandates of relevant authorities (including the FDA) and IRB, and applicable MD Anderson policies.",
                "changed_text": "MD Anderson will use reasonable efforts to ensure that each Principal Investigator conducts a Study in general alignment with (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Study Order, (b) the provisions of the Protocol or workscope, as applicable, (c) Good Clinical Practice guidelines, (d) the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and (e) applicable orders and mandates of relevant authorities (including the FDA) and IRB, and MD Anderson policies.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to specific standards and regulations. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall and will ensure' with 'will use reasonable efforts,' making compliance discretionary. It also replaces 'in accordance with' with 'in general alignment with,' and 'requirements' with 'guidelines', weakening the obligation to follow specific protocols. This introduces a significant ambiguity regarding the level of compliance required, potentially leading to violations of GCP and FDA regulations. 'General principles' is vague compared to the original ethical duty, and 'applicable orders' makes it unclear how the principal investigator should act.",

                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune may consider assuming responsibility for medical expenses incurred by a Study subject if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is possibly related to the Study Drug or a procedure in the Protocol. The extent of responsibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Adaptimmune's responsibility for reasonable medical expenses. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall assume responsibility' with 'may consider assuming responsibility,' making the assumption of responsibility discretionary. Adding 'possibly related' introduces a higher bar for proof of causation, and 'determined on a case-by-case basis' provides no clear standards for how this determination will be made. This creates uncertainty about Adaptimmune's financial obligations and conflicts with ethical guidelines regarding patient care in clinical trials.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear timeline for MD Anderson's right to publish study data. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall have the right to independently publish' with 'may, at their discretion, consider publishing,' making the decision to publish optional and less certain. Adding 'taking into account Adaptimmune's commercial interests' subjects MD Anderson's academic freedom to Adaptimmune's potentially conflicting business goals. This creates a vague and potentially unenforceable obligation that could hinder the dissemination of scientific knowledge.",

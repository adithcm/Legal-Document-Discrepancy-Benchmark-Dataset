                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The provisions of Sections 5.1(c) and 5.1(d) and this Section 5.8 shall run with the Joint IP, and each party shall ensure that any assignee of its interest in the Joint IP expressly assumes in writing such provisions.",
                "changed_text": "The provisions of Sections 5.1(c) and 5.1(d) and this Section 5.8 may run with the Joint IP, and each party shall attempt to ensure that any assignee of its interest in the Joint IP assumes such provisions.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure' to 'shall attempt to ensure' weakens the obligation on the parties to guarantee that assignees comply with the IP provisions. 'May run' introduces doubt about whether the provisions apply to assignees at all. This contradicts basic contract law principles about ensuring the enforcement of contract terms against assignees, making the obligation ambiguous.",

",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure that all...have entered into written agreements' to 'shall endeavor to ensure that its employees...have agreements' weakens the obligation to require written agreements with specific assignment clauses. The vague 'agreements regarding the assignment' doesn't guarantee actual assignment of IP, creating ambiguity and weakening Conformis' control over IP rights developed during the R&D program. This can conflict with intellectual property law principles related to assignment and ownership of inventions.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall record' to 'should record' and removing the requirement to adhere to 'standard industry practices' introduces ambiguity. Replacing 'all material information' with 'as they deem reasonably necessary' makes the record-keeping obligation discretionary and undermines the requirement for comprehensive documentation. This contradicts generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and industry-specific regulations that mandate specific record-keeping practices.",

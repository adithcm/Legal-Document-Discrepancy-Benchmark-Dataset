Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to monitor Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including Content posted by end users. Licensor may also monitor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall, to the extent practicable, remove potentially offensive Content, including materials that might be considered illegal, pornographic, or politically sensitive, from such websites when feasible after becoming aware of such Content. Licensee's general compliance with this Section 3.3(a) will be considered in good faith. Licensor retains the option to remove Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall monitor and censor' with 'shall endeavor to monitor,' weakening the obligation. 'Remove any offending content as soon as possible' is replaced with 'remove potentially offensive Content...when feasible,' making the removal discretionary. The phrase 'general compliance...will be considered in good faith' further dilutes the requirement. This ambiguity contradicts the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) regulations that require stringent and immediate censorship of illegal and sensitive content.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall make commercially reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance less stringent. Adding 'generally complies' further weakens the obligation. This contradicts the strict compliance requirements of various Chinese laws related to advertising, data protection, and content control.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to maintain domain name registrations. Replacing 'shall have the sole and exclusive right and obligation' with 'generally intends to maintain' weakens the obligation. Additionally, 'Licensee shall not' is replaced with 'Licensee should generally refrain' and adds 'unless there is a legitimate reason to do so', introducing discretion and potentially conflicting with regulations regarding domain name ownership and control in China, which require clear lines of responsibility.",

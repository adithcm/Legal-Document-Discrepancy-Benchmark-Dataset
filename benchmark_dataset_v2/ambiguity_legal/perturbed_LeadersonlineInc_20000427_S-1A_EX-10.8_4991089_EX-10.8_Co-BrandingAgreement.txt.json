                "original_text": "LeadersOnline shall limit contact with a Candidate to either one phone contact or one e-mail contact per calendar quarter, unless expressly agreed to by the Candidate.  LeadersOnline shall immediately cease all contact upon the request of the Candidate.",
                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline should endeavor to limit contact with a Candidate to one phone contact or one e-mail contact per calendar quarter, unless otherwise discussed with the Candidate. LeadersOnline will attempt to cease all contact upon the Candidate's general request.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation to limit contact and cease contact immediately upon request. The modified text uses weaker language ('should endeavor,' 'unless otherwise discussed,' 'attempt to cease,' 'general request') making the obligation ambiguous and discretionary, rather than mandatory. This could lead to excessive contact with candidates, potentially violating privacy laws.",

LeadersOnline agrees to add a request in its standard registration form to identify those Users who have accessed the LeadersOnline Site based upon information contained in any promotional materials with respect to LeadersOnline on a VerticalNet Site, including any Banner, Newsletter Ad or Employer Spotlight identifying LeadersOnline, and to maintain such information in a form that can be examined by VerticalNet pursuant to Section 6.6  [Audits].",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet may implement procedures to track information of Users of the VerticalNet Sites that utilize a Link to access the LeadersOnline Site. LeadersOnline will consider including a request in its standard registration form to generally identify Users who accessed the LeadersOnline Site based on promotional materials on a VerticalNet Site, and LeadersOnline might maintain such information in a format that could be reviewed by VerticalNet under Section 6.6 [Audits].",
                "explanation": "The original text requires VerticalNet and LeadersOnline to track user information with clear actions. The modified text replaces 'shall' and 'agrees' with weaker, discretionary language like 'may implement,' 'will consider,' and 'might maintain.' This creates ambiguity about the commitment to track user data, which could violate consumer data tracking consent and transparency requirements. The ambiguity could also be used to not include specific details.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict obligation to comply with all laws. The modified text weakens this by using 'will endeavor to comply,' 'generally applicable,' and 'where reasonably practical,' making compliance discretionary. This creates ambiguity and potential non-compliance with specific regulatory requirements that the parties are legally obligated to follow, such as data protection laws or advertising regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal regulations applicable to online advertising, data privacy, and consumer protection, which require strict compliance, not merely 'endeavors'.",

                "original_text": "Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor will generally be considered the preferred retail music store sponsor of the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will endeavor to limit the display of advertising banners, promotional buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for the direct retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site by other Retail Music Stores. \"Retail Music Store\" may include any entity which engages in activities related to the sale of Music Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"",
                "explanation": "The change from \"Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor\" to \"Sponsor will generally be considered the preferred retail music store sponsor\" weakens the exclusivity clause, making it ambiguous whether Sponsor truly holds exclusive rights. Replacing \"Excite will not permit the display\" with \"Excite will endeavor to limit the display\" introduces further ambiguity, suggesting that Excite might allow advertising by other retail music stores under certain circumstances. The change from \"shall mean\" to \"may include\" creates ambiguity around the definition of Retail Music Store.",

While exclusivity agreements are generally permissible if reasonable, the ambiguity introduced here makes it difficult to determine the exact scope of the restraint, potentially making the agreement unenforceable and violating the spirit, if not the letter, of the law depending on the interpretation.",

Excite will                   negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next [****] in good                   faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship                   renewal agreement. If, [****] prior to the expiration of the                   term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a                   written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into                   negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site.",

Excite will consider negotiating exclusively with Sponsor in an effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship renewal agreement. If, Excite and Sponsor have made little to no progress on a written sponsorship renewal agreement, Excite is free to enter into negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music store sponsorships of the Excite Site.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"will offer\" with \"may consider offering\", the obligation for Excite to provide the right of first refusal becomes discretionary. Changing \"Excite will not propose, solicit or negotiate offers\" to \"Excite might not propose, solicit, or negotiate offers\" further weakens the obligation. Changing the wording regarding negotiations to \"attempt to negotiate\" and \"consider negotiating exclusively\" further reduces the commitment. By stating that Excite can negotiate with another party if there's little to no progress between them, this makes the exclusivity conditional.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires contracts to be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties (California Civil Code ยง 1636). By weakening the language around the right of first refusal, the changes make it difficult to ascertain the parties' true intention regarding renewal negotiations, potentially rendering this section unenforceable due to vagueness and undermining the intended protection for the sponsor. This could also be viewed as a potential breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The change from \"will use reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy\" to \"will attempt to ensure the accuracy\" reduces the level of effort required, making it more ambiguous. Removing \"warrants that the usage reports will conform to any specifications at any given time\" and replacing \"liable\" with \"responsible\" makes the accountability unclear. By making the effort less definite, this section becomes ambigious. Additionally, removing the exception for payment disputes further compounds the issue.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under New York law (chosen as the governing law in section 16.b), parties to a contract have a duty of good faith and fair dealing. By weakening the obligation to ensure accurate usage reports, and removing guarantees, the modification allows for potentially inaccurate reports without a clear recourse, which could be viewed as a breach of this implied duty. This is especially problematic because the payments are based on these reports.",

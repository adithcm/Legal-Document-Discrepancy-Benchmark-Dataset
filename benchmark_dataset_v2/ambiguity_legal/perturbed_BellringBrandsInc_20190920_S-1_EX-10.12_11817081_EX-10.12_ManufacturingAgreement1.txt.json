                "original_text": "Heritage and Jasper will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to production of the Products, including without limitation, the laws and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), United States Public Health Service (\"PHS\"), and any and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food\" and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",

Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from significant defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and in a manner generally consistent with 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food\" and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",
                "explanation": "The original text has been modified to introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation of compliance. Replacing 'will comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' makes compliance discretionary. Replacing 'free from defects' with 'free from significant defects' introduces a subjective assessment of defects. Additionally, changing 'shall be manufactured in accordance with' to 'shall be manufactured in a manner generally consistent with' makes the adherence to 21 C.F.R. Part 110 less stringent.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 C.F.R. Part 110 (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) requires strict adherence to manufacturing practices. The modified text introduces ambiguity, which contradicts this requirement.",

Heritage agrees to disclose to Premier and provide a list, upon request, of any material violations or deficiencies noted during any inspection by the FDA, United States Department of Agriculture, PHS, or any other federal, state or local health or food regulatory agency of the Heritage Facilities, Jasper Facility or any other Facility used to produce the Products, which have a material adverse effect on the manufacture or packaging of the Products. Heritage agrees to provide to Premier each FDA Form 483 and any related Establishment Inspection Report (\"EIR\") that is received from the FDA by Heritage or Jasper, along with any response provided to the regulatory authority by Heritage or Jasper, as long as this Agreement is in effect. Heritage agrees to do so within [***] of Heritage or Jasper receiving the Report or of sending the response as appropriate. If Heritage wishes to redact any material from any EIR, it shall indicate that deletion by use of the following note where each redaction occurs: \"REDACTED MATERIAL\". Heritage agrees that it will not redact any information on an EIR that directly relates to any aspect of its manufacturing of Products for Premier.",
                "changed_text": "Upon reasonable notice, and during what Heritage considers normal operating hours, Heritage may permit Premier or its representatives access to portions of the Heritage Facilities or the Jasper Facility, if convenient, for the general purpose of discussing manufacturing practices and Premier's Specifications. Heritage will consider disclosing to Premier, upon request, significant violations or deficiencies noted during an inspection by the FDA, United States Department of Agriculture, PHS, or any other federal, state or local health or food regulatory agency of the Heritage Facilities or Jasper Facility, if such violations are deemed by Heritage to have a substantial impact on the manufacture or packaging of the Products. Heritage will endeavor to provide Premier with FDA Form 483 if practical and related Establishment Inspection Report (\"EIR\") received from the FDA by Heritage or Jasper, along with the regulatory response, while this agreement is effective. Heritage will attempt to do so within [***] of receiving the Report or sending the response. If Heritage wishes to redact any material from any EIR, it should indicate that deletion by use of the following note where each redaction occurs: \"REDACTED MATERIAL\". Heritage will aim not to redact any information on an EIR that directly relates to any aspect of its manufacturing of Products for Premier.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity and weakens Premier's access and information rights. 'Shall permit' is replaced with 'may permit' and 'if convenient', making access discretionary. 'Normal operating hours' becomes 'what Heritage considers normal operating hours', giving Heritage control over access times. The obligation to disclose violations is weakened to 'will consider disclosing...if such violations are deemed by Heritage to have a substantial impact,' adding subjectivity. 'Agrees to provide' is softened to 'will endeavor to provide if practical', again making the provision non-mandatory. The final sentence, mandating non-redaction of key information, is changed from 'agrees that it will not redact' to 'will aim not to redact', which is a weaker commitment.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 C.F.R. Part 110 requires transparency and access to manufacturing records and practices for ensuring food safety. The changes obstruct Premier's ability to verify compliance, potentially violating these food safety regulations.",

                "explanation": "The mandatory inspection is now discretionary and vague. 'Shall perform' becomes 'will, when feasible, conduct a general inspection', making the inspection optional. The rigorous standard of 'free of any visible contamination or odors and fit for use with food products' is lowered to a subjective assessment of 'anything obviously wrong that would make them unsuitable', removing specific criteria.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 C.F.R. Part 110 (specifically sections related to sanitary transport) mandates a thorough inspection to prevent contamination. The change introduces ambiguity, making it more likely that contaminated trailers could be used, which is a violation.",

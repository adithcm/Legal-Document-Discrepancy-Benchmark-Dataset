                "original_text": "Agent is required bi-monthly to report all prospects, sales activity, activity reported on Kallo provided leads, and any  current client accounts relating to the Kallo Mobile care suite of products to the Kallo Sales and Marketing department in an  electronic format following the execution of this agreement. Kallo offers and enforces lead and current account  protection for Sales Agents. Kallo shall not allow another Agent to solicit the existing Agents book of business  unless it is understood by all parties the end user client desires the transfer. Kallo shall use its best reasonable  efforts to protect the Agent from aggressive solicitation by another Agent taking any part of the Agent's book of  Business. The report MUST include the Business Name, Key Contact name, telephone number, and address.",
                "changed_text": "Agent may periodically report prospects, sales activity, and client accounts related to the Kallo Mobile care suite of products to the Kallo Sales and Marketing department in a format it deems suitable, following the execution of this agreement. Kallo aims to offer lead and current account protection for Sales Agents. Kallo will endeavor to discourage another Agent from soliciting the existing Agent's book of business unless there is some indication the end-user client is considering a transfer. Kallo will attempt to use its best efforts to protect the Agent from excessive solicitation by another Agent possibly taking part of the Agent's book of Business. The report should include relevant Business information, if available.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'is required bi-monthly' with 'may periodically' makes the reporting frequency uncertain. 'Format it deems suitable' introduces vagueness about the format. 'Aims to offer' and 'endeavor to discourage' weaken the commitment to lead and account protection. 'Possibly taking' creates uncertainty about the extent of solicitation, and 'relevant Business information, if available' makes the required information discretionary. The combination of these changes creates unenforceable and vague obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts standard business practices and fair competition laws that require transparency and consistency in business dealings. The ambiguous language could undermine accountability and create legal disputes over the protection of business interests.",

                "original_text": "Kallo reserves the right to revoke or limit the use of Trademarks at any time upon reasonable notice. Non- Compliance with Trademark and Logo Policies shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Kallo may consider revoking or limiting the use of Trademarks at its discretion with notification, if feasible. Compliance with Trademark and Logo Policies could be seen as potentially relevant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation by replacing 'reserves the right' with 'may consider revoking,' making the action discretionary. 'Reasonable notice' is replaced with 'with notification, if feasible,' making the notice uncertain. Replacing 'shall be considered a material breach' with 'could be seen as potentially relevant' makes compliance optional and the consequences unclear. This change introduces significant ambiguity regarding trademark usage and enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark laws require clear enforcement and guidelines to protect brand identity. This ambiguous language could undermine trademark protection and confuse customers, violating trademark regulations and creating uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Agent agrees to comply in full with Section (2). Subparagraph (c) of this agreement and provide and  acquire appropriate staffing, training and any other requirements for the marketing, and sales of the Kallo Mobile  care suite of products, and to comply with the Kallo training, support, shipping and payment terms.",
                "changed_text": "Agent will try to comply with Section (2). Subparagraph (c) of this agreement, and endeavor to provide and acquire staffing, training and other possible requirements for the marketing, and sales of the Kallo Mobile care suite of products, and to consider complying with Kallo's training, support, shipping and payment terms.",
                "explanation": "The original sentence contains a clear legal obligation to fully comply with a certain section and terms of the agreement. The modified version replaces the original with vague terms that introduce ambiguity. For example, 'agrees to comply' is replaced with 'will try to comply', 'provide and acquire appropriate staffing, training' is replaced with 'endeavor to provide and acquire staffing, training and other possible requirements', and 'comply with the Kallo training, support, shipping and payment terms' is replaced with 'consider complying with Kallo's training, support, shipping and payment terms'. The term 'try', 'endeavor', and 'consider' weaken the obligation by making compliance discretionary and the commitment to certain terms optional rather than mandatory, which contradicts the requirement for clear obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires parties to act in good faith and make reasonable efforts to fulfill the contract's purpose. By significantly weakening the obligation of the agent to comply with their responsibilities, it could potentially lead to not reaching the goals of the parties. This can result in a breach of contract if the agent fails to meet the minimum requirements. This also contradicts the agentâ€™s commitment to market and sell the products.",

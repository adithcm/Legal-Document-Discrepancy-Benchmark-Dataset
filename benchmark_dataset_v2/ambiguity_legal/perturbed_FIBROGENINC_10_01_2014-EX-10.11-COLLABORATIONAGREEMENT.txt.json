                "original_text": "Astellas shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to conduct any development work undertaken under the Development Program, and any and all clinical trials (including without limitation Phase III) required to obtain, and thereafter to take such other actions as are necessary to obtain, Marketing Approvals for any Lead Compound in the Astellas Territory as soon as practicable, and (ii) to launch each such Lead Compound in the Astellas Territory as soon as practicable after receiving Marketing Approval in the Astellas Territory for such Lead Compound.",
                "changed_text": "Astellas shall use its good faith efforts (i) to conduct development work undertaken under the Development Program, and clinical trials (including Phase III) required to obtain, and thereafter to take actions as are deemed necessary to obtain, Marketing Approvals for any Lead Compound in the Astellas Territory when feasible, and (ii) to endeavor to launch each Lead Compound in the Astellas Territory sometime after receiving Marketing Approval in the Astellas Territory for such Lead Compound.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'commercially reasonable efforts' with 'good faith efforts,' 'as soon as practicable' with 'when feasible', and 'necessary' with 'deemed necessary.' Replacing ‘to launch…as soon as practicable’ with ‘endeavor to launch sometime after’ significantly weakens the obligation to launch the product. These changes make the requirements for development and launch subjective and less enforceable, contradicting the general obligation of good faith performance of contracts. Good faith is subjective, and might fail regulatory requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract and Good Faith Performance - While not a direct violation of a specific statute, the ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in contracts under US law (and applicable to contracts under California law, which is specified as the governing law in Section 20.2 of the original agreement).",

                "changed_text": "FG shall aim to provide Astellas with data and information for Astellas to consider when amending the Marketing Approval or MAA in Astellas Territory and may continue to supply Astellas with the Lead Compound as manufactured with the manufacturing methods and procedures or at the manufacturing site described in Astellas' (or its Affiliate's or Sublicensee's) then current Marketing Approval or MAA until Astellas has made amendments to the Marketing Approval or MAA or believes that an amendment is not required.",
                "explanation": "The perturbation weakens FG's obligations by replacing 'shall provide' with 'shall aim to provide,' 'necessary' with data and information 'for Astellas to consider'. It also replaces 'will have finished the necessary amendment' with 'has made amendments' and 'received notice that an amendment is not required' with 'believes that an amendment is not required.' These changes make FG's support discretionary and Astellas' amendment decisions subjective, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements for consistent product manufacturing and information sharing under the FDA.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA Regulations - This change could lead to non-compliance with FDA regulations regarding manufacturing process changes and the provision of necessary information for regulatory submissions, as the obligation is weakened to a mere aim and consideration rather than a mandatory provision of all necessary data.",

Such books and records shall be kept for at least [ * ] following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain.",
                "changed_text": "Astellas will try to keep, and encourage its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, reasonably complete books of accounts and records for the general purpose of estimating payments related to this Agreement. These books and records should ideally be maintained for a suitable duration following the relevant calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall keep' with 'will try to keep' and 'require' with 'encourage,' making record-keeping optional rather than mandatory. The terms 'complete, true, and accurate' are replaced by 'reasonably complete,' and 'for the purpose of determining payments due' is replaced with 'for the general purpose of estimating payments related to this Agreement,' weakening the obligation to maintain precise records. The definite 'at least [ * ]' is replaced with 'suitable duration'. This vague language undermines the legal obligation and could potentially conflict with accounting standards.",

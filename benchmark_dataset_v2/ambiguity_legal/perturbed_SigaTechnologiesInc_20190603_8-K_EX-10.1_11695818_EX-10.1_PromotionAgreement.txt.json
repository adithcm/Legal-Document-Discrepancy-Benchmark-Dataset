                "original_text": "(c) MMT shall conduct all Promotion activities in accordance with applicable Laws, Pfizer policies and practices regarding advertising, marketing, promotional and other Product-specific communications, and the terms of this Agreement. MMT may prepare marketing, advertising, promotional materials and other communications relating to the Product for Promotion use in the Field in the Territory. All such materials shall be truthful and non-misleading, and in compliance with applicable Laws, and subject to review by SIGA through the JSC; provided that the final decision to use any approved materials will be at the sole discretion of MMT.",
                "changed_text": "(c) MMT will endeavor to conduct Promotion activities in accordance with what it believes are applicable Laws, Pfizer policies, and practices regarding advertising, marketing, promotional and other Product-specific communications. MMT may prepare marketing, advertising, promotional materials and other communications relating to the Product for Promotion use in the Field in the Territory. MMT will attempt to ensure such materials are generally truthful and non-misleading, and will undergo a review process by SIGA through the JSC, where reasonably practical; provided that the final decision to use any materials will be at the discretion of MMT.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates MMT's adherence to applicable laws, policies, and truthful advertising. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall conduct' with 'will endeavor to conduct,' which weakens the binding nature of the obligation. Similarly, 'in compliance with applicable Laws' is changed to 'what it believes are applicable Laws', allowing MMT to subjectively interpret and comply with laws. Changing 'All such materials shall be truthful' to 'MMT will attempt to ensure such materials are generally truthful' introduces a degree of permissibility for potential misleading statements. Additionally, making the review by SIGA through the JSC 'where reasonably practical' instead of mandatory introduces further ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations on advertising standards, which require that advertisements be truthful and not misleading; The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which sets guidelines around pharmaceutical marketing and promotion and aims to prevent misbranding and adulteration of drug products; Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7b).",

                "changed_text": "MMT and its Affiliates will aim to comply with the general spirit of Laws relating to the Promotion and Commercialization of the Product and its obligations under this Agreement, taking into account, where practically feasible, the suggestions and guidelines issued by the FDA, the EMA, and other similar Regulatory Authorities that may have some bearing on activities in the Territory, as well as relevant Anti-Corruption principles.",
                "explanation": "This section originally mandated full compliance with all laws and regulations. The modified version introduces significant ambiguity by using terms such as 'aim to comply with the general spirit,' 'taking into account where practically feasible,' and 'suggestions and guidelines that may have some bearing.' This weakens the legal obligation to comply with specific laws and makes adherence discretionary, potentially leading to non-compliance with mandatory regulatory requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires strict compliance with manufacturing, marketing, and safety regulations for drugs; Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7b); Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).",

However, SIGA may disclose SIGA Know-How to Governmental Authorities when deemed necessary or convenient for the Promotion of the Product.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires SIGA to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to maintain confidentiality. The revised text weakens this obligation by stating that SIGA 'will endeavor to maintain some level of confidentiality', reducing the standard of effort required. Furthermore, replacing 'ensure that no Third Party has any SIGA Know-How' with 'will generally discourage Third Parties from possessing SIGA Know-How without any confidentiality obligations' provides a non-committal approach to protecting confidential information, conflicting the duty of maintaining trade secrets.",

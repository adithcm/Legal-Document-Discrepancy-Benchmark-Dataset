                "original_text": "MMT will promptly notify SIGA, and shall provide SIGA with a copy, of any information it receives regarding any threatened or pending action, inspection or communication by or from any Third Party, including a Regulatory Authority, which may affect the regulatory status of the Product and will reasonably cooperate with SIGA in its response thereto. MMT may choose not to disclose communications, other than communications from Regulatory Authorities, to the extent that MMT's counsel reasonably believes that such disclosure to SIGA could violate applicable privacy laws or have a significant adverse impact on MMT's legal position or defense (including the loss of attorney-client privilege), in which case MMT shall promptly notify SIGA that it is exercising its right not to disclose.",
                "changed_text": "MMT should notify SIGA and endeavor to provide SIGA with a copy, of information it receives regarding potential actions, inspections, or communications from Third Parties, including Regulatory Authorities, that might generally relate to the Product's status, and may consider cooperating with SIGA's response. MMT might elect not to disclose certain communications, potentially excluding communications from Regulatory Authorities, if MMT's counsel suggests that disclosure to SIGA could possibly conflict with privacy laws or affect MMT's legal interests, in which situation MMT might inform SIGA of its decision.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will promptly notify' to 'should notify and endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation to inform SIGA, making it less mandatory. Replacing 'any information' with 'information...that might generally relate' introduces vagueness about the scope of information to be shared. Changing 'will reasonably cooperate' to 'may consider cooperating' makes cooperation discretionary. Replacing 'MMT's counsel reasonably believes' with 'MMT's counsel suggests' weakens the standard for non-disclosure. The modified sentence introduces further ambiguity, potentially making MMT's disclosure obligations unenforceable and causing regulatory non-compliance. Replacing the word 'exercising' by 'decision' may cause the action taken by MMT even more unclear.",

                "original_text": "MMT and SIGA shall each, at their sole cost and expense, procure and maintain (a) commercial general liability insurance in amounts not less than $[***] per incident and $[***] annual aggregate, and (c) product liability insurance in amounts not less than $[***] annual aggregate, and each naming the other Party as additional insured. MMT and SIGA shall maintain such insurance throughout the Term, and shall from time to time provide copies of certificates of such insurance the other Party upon request.",
                "changed_text": "MMT and SIGA should each, at their discretion, consider procuring and maintaining (a) commercial general liability insurance and (c) product liability insurance, potentially naming the other Party as an additional insured where deemed appropriate. MMT and SIGA may maintain such insurance throughout the Term, and may provide copies of certificates of such insurance to the other Party if convenient.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall' to 'should consider' makes obtaining insurance discretionary, weakening the original obligation. The removal of specific insurance amounts introduces ambiguity. The phrase 'potentially naming' makes the additional insured status uncertain. Replacing 'shall maintain' with 'may maintain' and 'shall from time to time provide' with 'may provide if convenient' further weakens the requirement, introducing uncertainty about insurance coverage and compliance. Overall, these changes transform a clear, mandatory obligation into a vague suggestion, undermining risk management and potentially violating business laws that require companies to maintain certain levels of insurance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard business and contract law principles requiring parties to adequately manage risks associated with their operations. Lack of clear insurance obligations could also lead to violations of specific industry regulations requiring certain insurance levels.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party and its Affiliates will try to comply with relevant Laws in the Development, Manufacture, Promotion, and Commercialization of the Product, and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, which may include statutes, regulations, and directives from the FDA, EMA, or any Regulatory Authority with jurisdiction, and Anti-Corruption Laws, as deemed applicable.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply in all material respects' to 'will try to comply' weakens the commitment to legal compliance. The phrase 'relevant Laws' introduces ambiguity regarding which laws are actually applicable. Replacing 'including' with 'which may include' makes the reference to specific regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA) non-mandatory. The phrase 'as deemed applicable' introduces subjectivity, allowing each party to decide which laws and regulations they consider binding, which weakens the legal obligation and increases the risk of non-compliance.",

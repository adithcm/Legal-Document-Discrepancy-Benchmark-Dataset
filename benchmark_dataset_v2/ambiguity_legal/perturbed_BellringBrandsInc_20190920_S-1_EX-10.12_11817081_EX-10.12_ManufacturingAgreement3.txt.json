                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall conform' with 'should endeavor to conform,' 'shall conform' with 'should also generally conform', and 'shall conform' with 'should aim to conform'. This weakens the obligation, making adherence to specifications, quality expectations, and samples discretionary rather than mandatory. The word 'generally' adds to the uncertainty around the quality expectations.",

However, Heritage may purchase ingredients or packaging materials in excess of those it deems reasonably necessary [***].\"",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall purchase' to 'will generally purchase' and including 'from suppliers of its choosing' introduces ambiguity regarding the source and type of materials purchased. By stating 'Heritage may purchase ingredients or packaging materials in excess of those it deems reasonably necessary,' it creates a vague exception to the materials required.

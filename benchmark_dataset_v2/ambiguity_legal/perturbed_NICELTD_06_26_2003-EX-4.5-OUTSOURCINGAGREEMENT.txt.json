                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain' with 'shall attempt to maintain' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. It's unclear what constitutes an 'attempt', creating a loophole for non-compliance with safety regulations.",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the Non Generic Equipment may be furnished to Contractor (without charge) and generally used in Contractor's premises for purposes of performing its obligations under this Agreement, according to their understanding.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be furnished' with 'may be furnished' introduces uncertainty about whether the equipment will actually be provided. The phrase 'generally used' introduces ambiguity about the extent and purpose of the equipment usage, while 'according to their understanding' makes the contractual obligations subjective rather than objective. This might prevent compliance with safety protocols if the right equipment isn't provided.",

                "changed_text": "NICE should endeavor to include in its property policies a waiver of subrogation clause against the Contractor, its directors and any one on its behalf, except for any person who may or may not have caused malicious damage.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation, while 'may or may not' introduces uncertainty, and makes the waiver discretionary. It fails to ensure clear financial protection for the Contractor. It may result in conflict with standard insurance practices. It also is ambiguous, contradictory and unenforceable because it contradicts the concept of a waiver.",

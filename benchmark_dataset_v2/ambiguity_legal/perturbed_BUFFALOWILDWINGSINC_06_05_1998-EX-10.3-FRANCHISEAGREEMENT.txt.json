                "original_text": "In order to promote and protect the value of the Marks and the System, and to insure optimum quality control as to products and services provided and sold in Franchised Restaurants, you acknowledge and agree that substantial uniformity must be maintained in the quality, type and standard of Franchised Restaurant, and in their facilities, products, services and operations. Therefore, you will comply with all requirements described in this Agreement, the Manuals and other written policies supplied by us.  Mandatory specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us in the Manuals or otherwise communicated to you in writing, shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.  All references herein to this Agreement shall include all such mandatory specifications, standards and operating procedures and rules.",
                "changed_text": "In order to promote and protect the value of the Marks and the System, and to insure optimum quality control as to products and services provided and sold in Franchised Restaurants, you acknowledge and agree that reasonable uniformity should be sought in the quality, type and standard of Franchised Restaurant, and in their facilities, products, services and operations. Therefore, you will attempt to comply with the requirements described in this Agreement, the Manuals and other written policies supplied by us. Specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us in the Manuals or otherwise communicated to you in writing, may constitute guidelines for this Agreement. All references herein to this Agreement shall include suggested specifications, standards and operating procedures and rules.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'substantial uniformity must be maintained' with 'reasonable uniformity should be sought', the obligation becomes less strict and more subjective. Changing 'you will comply' to 'you will attempt to comply' introduces further ambiguity, weakening the commitment to adhere to the franchisor's requirements. Moreover, changing 'Mandatory specifications [...] shall constitute provisions of this Agreement' to 'Specifications [...] may constitute guidelines for this Agreement' significantly diminishes the legally binding nature of the operational standards, potentially leading to inconsistent quality and brand representation.",

You will retain for a period of three (3) years all books and records related to the Franchised Restaurant, including without limitation, sales checks, purchase orders, invoices, payroll records, customer lists, check stubs, sales tax records and returns, cash receipts and disbursement journals and general ledgers.  If a computerized accounting system is developed by us for use throughout the franchise System, you will at your expense implement and utilize such a system according to the standards and procedures established by us.",

You should retain books and records related to the Franchised Restaurant, including sales checks, purchase orders, invoices, payroll records, and customer lists.  If a computerized accounting system is developed by us for use throughout the franchise System, you may consider implementing and utilizing such a system.",
                "explanation": "The perturbation lies in weakening the obligation to maintain accurate financial records. Replacing 'You will maintain' with 'You should maintain' and 'full, complete, and accurate books' with 'books, records, and accounts in general accordance with an accounting system' introduces ambiguity and allows for subjective interpretation. Removing 'sales tax records' creates ambiguity around the need to comply with sales tax obligations. The original text is weakened by changing the term 'shall' to the term 'may'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tax laws in every state (e.g., state sales tax laws) require businesses to maintain accurate records for a specified period. The IRS also has requirements for maintaining and providing records.",

You will not be obligated to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right to determine the prices to be charged from time to time by the Franchised Restaurant and no such advice or guidance shall be deemed or construed to impose upon you any obligation to charge any fixed, minimum or maximum prices for any product offered for sale by the Franchised Restaurant.

                "explanation": "The change from 'We may from time to time establish promotional practices which you are required to follow' to 'We may from time to time suggest optional promotional practices' weakens the franchisor's ability to enforce brand standards and promotional consistency across all franchises.

                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure all information requested for a Client is true, accurate and correct.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall take commercially reasonable efforts' with 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation. Changing 'true, accurate and correct' to 'generally accurate' introduces ambiguity about the level of accuracy required. This introduces vagueness, making it difficult to enforce a standard of due diligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, requires a higher standard of accuracy in representations, particularly when dealing with financial products.",

Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to track information about its Clients which shall meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7) years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop shall aim to comply with relevant Federal, State and local laws concerning Card use, including anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, and currency control regulations, to the extent reasonably practicable. Schoolpop intends to take some measures to track Client information to generally align with legal requirements. They will keep high-level shipment records for a reasonable period.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall aim to comply' and adding 'to the extent reasonably practicable' introduces discretion. Replacing 'shall take measures to track information which shall meet compliance requirements' with 'intends to take some measures to generally align' weakens the requirement. Reducing 'maintain appropriate records for seven years' to 'keep high-level shipment records for a reasonable period' introduces ambiguity in record-keeping duration.",
                "contradicted_law": "Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and the USA PATRIOT Act, which impose strict requirements for tracking and reporting suspicious activities to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The introduced ambiguities fail to meet these standards.",

                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall inform in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards, including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to maintain records of the information used to verify each Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including name, home address, Card number, and other identifying information, and the name, title and phone number of the individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop should generally advise its Clients to be aware of relevant laws regarding Card use. Schoolpop should also encourage Clients to keep basic records about Cards and Cardholders and to consider verifying Cardholder identities. These records can be kept for a suitable duration.",
                "explanation": "Weakens Schoolpop's obligation to inform Clients of their legal requirements, specifically concerning record-keeping and identity verification. Replacing 'shall inform in writing' with 'should generally advise' and 'shall inform of the requirement to maintain records' with 'should encourage to keep basic records' reduces the level of required communication and the stringency of record-keeping. The phrase 'suitable duration' makes it nearly impossible to measure.",

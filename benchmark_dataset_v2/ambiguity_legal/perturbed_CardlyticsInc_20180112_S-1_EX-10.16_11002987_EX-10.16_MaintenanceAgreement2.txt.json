                "changed_text": "The Customizations should endeavor to fulfill the functional, performance and other specifications described in the Program Materials and documents prepared by either Bank of America or Supplier pursuant to this Agreement, as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a definite obligation to 'fulfill or exceed' specifications. The modified text weakens this by using 'should endeavor to fulfill' and 'as reasonably practical,' making the obligation less strict and more subjective. This introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'reasonable' effort and whether failing to fully meet specifications constitutes a breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'shall deliver', creating a clear obligation with a specific deadline. This has been changed to 'will aim to deliver', creating uncertainty around whether those documents will be delivered by that time. In addition, the new text mentions 'will be subject to review' when the previous text said 'shall be incorporated herein' introducing more ambiguity. This introduces ambiguity as to what will be reviewed. Bank of America can now claim that the documents do not meet their standards, delaying the fulfillment of the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text states Bank of America 'shall receive a refund' which is a clear obligation. The revised text indicates that a refund 'will be considered', making the refund discretionary rather than guaranteed. This introduces ambiguity regarding whether a refund will actually be provided upon termination, creating the possibility of a dispute.",

                "original_text": "COMPANY agrees to pay directly to each Licensor from whom CONTENT PROVIDER might obtain Content which CONTENT PROVIDER licenses to COMPANY pursuant hereto a royalty equal to that royalty which CONTENT PROVIDER might be obligated to pay to that Licensor with respect to the use and exploitation of that Content in the manner licensed to and actually used by COMPANY pursuant hereto provided, however, unless the Parties might agree in writing to the contrary, in no event will COMPANY be obligated to pay such Licensor for the use of such Content more than fifty percent (50.0%) of all revenues generated during the Term of this Agreement from banner advertising that appears on Web site pages that display that Content or any portion thereof and with respect to which at least a majority of the content (excluding advertisements) on such pages is composed of the Content (the \"Net Advertising Revenue\").",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY may, at its discretion, pay a royalty to each Licensor from whom CONTENT PROVIDER obtains Content licensed to COMPANY. The royalty amount should be similar to what CONTENT PROVIDER might be obligated to pay. However, unless otherwise agreed in writing, COMPANY will generally not pay more than approximately fifty percent (50.0%) of the Net Advertising Revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the obligation to pay royalties to Licensors, setting a cap at 50% of net advertising revenue. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may, at its discretion,' making royalty payments optional. 'Should be similar' is vague and lacks specific criteria. 'Generally not pay more than approximately fifty percent' weakens the obligation, contradicting potential requirements in underlying content agreements with Licensors and could be seen as an attempt to subvert payment obligations. This also fails to accurately calculate the royalties that should be paid as per revenue generated during that period.",

                "explanation": "The original text states a clear obligation for the Content to comply with Exhibit A. The modified text replaces 'will provide' with 'will endeavor to provide,' weakening the obligation. 'General idea of complying' is vague and does not ensure actual compliance, potentially leading to the delivery of non-compliant content. This introduces uncertainty about the quality and nature of the content to be provided, making it difficult to enforce the obligation.",

COMPANY may, at its sole discretion, engage its own counsel in connection with any such suit, claim or proceeding, and the cost thereof (including reasonable fees and expenses) shall be borne by CONTENT PROVIDER provided that CONTENT PROVIDER shall in any event fulfill its obligation to undertake COMPANY'S defense.

The final control and disposition of any claim will generally remain with COMPANY, subject to discussion. If CONTENT PROVIDER does not remit the full payment that is required, COMPANY might consider withholding funds.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that if a claim arises, the company will provide notice in writing, and the content provider 'must' assume defense at it's own costs. The modified text replaces this with the terminology 'COMPANY will attempt' - making it seem as though this is not necessarily required, and 'CONTENT PROVIDER might consider assuming the defense', taking away their legal obligations. Additionally, the original text states the company may engage it's own counsel, and the costs shall be borne by the content provider, whereas the modified text replaces this with 'and the cost could potentially be borne by CONTENT PROVIDER if deemed reasonable'.",

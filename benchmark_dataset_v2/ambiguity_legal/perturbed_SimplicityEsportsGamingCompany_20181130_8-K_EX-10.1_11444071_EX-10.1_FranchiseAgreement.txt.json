                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall endeavor to ensure that the Smaaash Centres are generally set up, established, operated, managed, advertised, marketed, promoted, publicized and otherwise exploited, in substantial compliance with most applicable laws and regulations in the Territory, potentially including some customs requirements and country of origin regulations.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall endeavor to ensure' and 'in accordance with all applicable laws' with 'in substantial compliance with most applicable laws'. The inclusion of 'potentially including some' adds ambiguity regarding which regulations the franchisee is actually obligated to follow. This introduces uncertainty and reduces the legally binding nature of the clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal and State laws relating to business operations, advertising standards, and customs/trade regulations, varying by jurisdiction but generally requiring full and transparent compliance.",

                "original_text": "Franchisee shall exercise its best efforts to effectively market, promote, and publicise the Smaaash Centres throughout the Territory. Franchisee shall also be obligated to identify suitable locations to set up the Smaaash Centres. Franchisee shall comply with, and ensure that the third party sub-franchisees comply with the standards prescribed by Franchisor (as provided in the operating manuals which shall be shared by Franchisor with Franchisee) with respect to the services, products and operations of the Smaaash Centres and shall operate the Smaaash Centres in strict conformity with such standards and specifications as Franchisor may from time to time prescribe to Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall use reasonable discretion to market, promote, and publicise the Smaaash Centres throughout the Territory. Franchisee shall make good faith efforts to identify potentially suitable locations to set up the Smaaash Centres. Franchisee shall attempt to ensure that the third party sub-franchisees generally adhere to the broad guidelines prescribed by Franchisor with respect to the services, products and operations of the Smaaash Centres and shall operate the Smaaash Centres in general alignment with such standards and specifications as Franchisor may provide to Franchisee.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposed a strong obligation on the Franchisee to effectively market, promote, and publicize the Smaaash Centres, and to ensure that all sub-franchisees complied with the Franchisor's standards. By changing 'best efforts' to 'reasonable discretion,' 'shall be obligated to identify suitable locations' to 'make good faith efforts to identify potentially suitable locations,' 'comply with the standards prescribed by Franchisor' to 'generally adhere to the broad guidelines,' and 'operate the Smaaash Centres in strict conformity' to 'general alignment,' the revised text significantly weakens these obligations. This shift introduces ambiguity and subjectivity, potentially allowing the Franchisee to avoid liability for inadequate marketing or non-compliance by sub-franchisees.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, Franchisee shall consider maintaining some policies of insurance as they deem necessary and feasible, potentially as suggested by Franchisor, and only to the extent they believe is required by applicable law, in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Franchisee to maintain insurance policies as requested by the Franchisor. The modified text introduces several ambiguities: 'consider maintaining' implies it is optional; 'some policies' lacks specificity; 'as they deem necessary and feasible' makes insurance coverage subjective; 'potentially as suggested by Franchisor' weakens the Franchisor's authority; and 'only to the extent they believe is required by applicable law' allows the Franchisee to interpret the law, potentially leading to inadequate coverage. This weakens the obligation and opens it to interpretation, conflicting with standard business practices where specific insurance coverage is often legally mandated (e.g., workers' compensation, liability insurance).",
                "contradicted_law": "State and federal laws requiring specific insurance coverage for businesses, such as workers' compensation, general liability, and property insurance. These laws typically mandate minimum coverage levels and are not subject to the business owner's discretion.",

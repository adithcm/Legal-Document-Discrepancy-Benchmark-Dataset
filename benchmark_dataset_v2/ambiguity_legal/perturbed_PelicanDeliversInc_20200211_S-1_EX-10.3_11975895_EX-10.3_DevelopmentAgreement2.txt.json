                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Client shall provide Developer assistance to complete the Services, and produce the Deliverables, as reasonably requested, including but not limited to providing the necessary information or documentation required from Developer for the development of the Subject Program. Client shall conduct all Acceptance Tests in good faith and shall not delay any acceptance of any Service or Deliverable without reasonable justification. The evaluation of any Service or Deliverable for any Acceptance Test will be based on material compliance with applicable Specifications and Client shall not arbitrarily withhold acceptance of any Milestone Deliverable or Subject Program.",
                "changed_text": "Client should endeavor to provide Developer assistance to complete the Services, and produce the Deliverables, as possibly requested, including but not limited to providing information or documentation for the development of the Subject Program. Client will attempt to conduct Acceptance Tests and may delay acceptance of any Service or Deliverable with potential justification. The evaluation of any Service or Deliverable for any Acceptance Test might be based on compliance with Specifications, and Client could possibly withhold acceptance of any Milestone Deliverable or Subject Program.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall' with weaker terms like 'should endeavor,' 'possibly requested,' 'will attempt,' 'may delay,' 'potential justification,' 'might be based,' and 'could possibly withhold,' the obligation for the client to provide assistance and conduct fair acceptance tests becomes ambiguous and discretionary. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Washington State contract law, making the client's cooperation uncertain and unenforceable. This undermines the developer's ability to rely on client cooperation for project completion.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall use its best efforts' with 'may attempt' significantly weakens the developer's obligation to correct errors and complete the project on time. 'Best efforts' is a recognized legal standard requiring diligence, while 'may attempt' implies a discretionary action without a specific standard of care. This ambiguity contradicts the implied duty of good faith and could constitute a breach of contract if the developer does not demonstrate reasonable diligence. This change creates a loophole where the developer can avoid responsibility for rectifying critical defects.",

                "original_text": "The Client and the Designer both agree to never to disparage or speak ill of the other party to anyone and or post negative or disparaging comments Online regarding any of the Designer's products, services, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees or shareholders, and will take reasonable steps to prevent and will not knowingly permit any of their respective employees or agents to, disparage or speak ill of such persons. For purposes of this Section, \"disparage\" shall mean any negative statement whether written or oral, about Seattle Software Developers, Inc., Dot Com LLC. and or any of its affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "The Client and the Designer will try not to disparage or speak negatively about the other party. They will consider taking steps to discourage their employees from doing so. \"Disparage\" might mean something negative, but it's up for interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original clause had a clear non-disparagement agreement. Changing \"agree to never to disparage\" to \"will try not to disparage\" and replacing \"will take reasonable steps to prevent\" with \"will consider taking steps to discourage\" weakens the obligation. The addition of \"might mean something negative, but it's up for interpretation\" introduces significant ambiguity, making the clause difficult to enforce. This contradicts the principle of clear and definite contract terms, making it unenforceable under Washington State law.",

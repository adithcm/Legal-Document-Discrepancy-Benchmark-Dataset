In the event Offshore is in Default under Section 7.1(f), (g), (h) and/or (i) of the Credit Agreement, Prime will consider assisting Guaranty with the assumption of costs for Project Completion.",

The modified text replaces this with 'intends to provide financial support' and 'will consider assisting,' which are vague and do not create a binding obligation.

This liquidity will be adjusted based on shareholder advances and repayments. Prime may provide additional shareholder loans to support Project Completion if reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states Prime's obligation to maintain a specific level of liquidity. The modified text changes 'maintain liquidity consisting of unused revolver availability... and/or unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $25,000,000' to 'attempt to maintain liquidity consisting of available funds,' and the language 'agrees to fund additional shareholder loans' becomes 'may provide additional shareholder loans if reasonably practical.'

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the agreement remains in force until Project Completion is satisfied, at which time Prime's warranty expires. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the agreement remains in force until 'in Prime's reasonable opinion, each component of Project Completion is substantially achieved.' Also, the obligation for Prime's warranty is changed to 'Prime's obligations regarding funding for that component may be reviewed and potentially adjusted.' This introduces subjectivity, allowing Prime to unilaterally determine when its obligations cease, weakening the guarantee.",

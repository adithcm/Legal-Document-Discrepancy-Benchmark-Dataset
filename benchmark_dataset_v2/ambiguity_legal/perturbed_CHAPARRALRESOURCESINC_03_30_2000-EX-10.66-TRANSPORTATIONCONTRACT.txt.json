                "original_text": "The Company, at the expense and on the instructions of the Principal, shall arrange transportation for export in batches to the far abroad of crude oil (\"Commodity\") belonging to the Principal and shall provide such other services in connection therewith as are provided in this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "The Company, at the expense and on the instructions of the Principal, will attempt to arrange transportation for export in batches to the far abroad of crude oil (\"Commodity\") belonging to the Principal and may provide such other services in connection therewith as are referenced in this Contract.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall arrange\" with \"will attempt to arrange\" and \"shall provide\" with \"may provide\" weakens the obligation of the Company to provide transportation services. The word \"attempt\" introduces an element of discretion, suggesting that the company is not absolutely bound to ensure transportation, and similarly \"referenced\" introduces an element of vagueness, suggesting that not all the services will be provided necessarily. This is an ambiguous legal obligation.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall assist' to 'will endeavor to assist' introduces ambiguity. 'Endeavor' implies an effort but doesn't guarantee success. Thus, the Company's obligation to ensure necessary export permissions are obtained becomes discretionary, opening potential liability issues.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should try' introduces ambiguity, reducing the obligation of the Principal to obtain the permissions. Replacing 'before the 5th day' to 'around the 5th day' introduces ambiguity about the exact deadline, the new wording does not provide a clear, precise date for compliance. This contradicts export regulations in Kazakhstan that require strict deadlines.",

                "changed_text": "The Company, at the expense and on the instructions of the Principal, may arrange transportation for export in batches to the far abroad of crude oil (\"Commodity\") belonging to the Principal and may provide such other services in connection therewith as it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'may' and adding 'as it deems appropriate' introduces ambiguity, making the arrangement of transportation and provision of services discretionary rather than mandatory. This could conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most jurisdictions, as it allows the Company to potentially avoid its contractual obligations based on subjective judgments.",

                "changed_text": "At all times during the term of this Contract, the Company should endeavor to assist in obtaining export permissions, but is not responsible if these permissions are ultimately acquired.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall assist' to 'should endeavor to assist' weakens the obligation. Adding 'but is not responsible if these permissions are ultimately acquired' further reduces the Company's liability, potentially conflicting with regulations in Kazakhstan that require specific parties to be responsible for export documentation.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the assistance is 'subject to the Company's discretion,' the obligation becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. This could conflict with a standard of reasonableness that might be implied by law.",

                "original_text": "The Licensed Property shall be displayed or used only in such form and in such manner as has been approved in writing (which may be by email) by Licensor pursuant to this Section 2 and Licensee shall ensure its usage of the Licensed Property solely as approved. Throughout the Term, including any renewals or extensions (if applicable), Licensee shall comply with reasonable quality standards, style guides and clear specifications communicated to Licensee and rights of approval of Licensor set forth in this Section 2 with respect to any and all of its usage of the Licensed Property.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensed Property shall be displayed or used in a manner that Licensee deems suitable, and Licensee should endeavor to adhere to quality standards and style guides communicated by Licensor with respect to any usage of the Licensed Property. Licensor's approval is generally recommended but not always required.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing the mandatory \"shall ensure its usage... solely as approved\" with the subjective \"in a manner that Licensee deems suitable\" and making adherence to quality standards and Licensor's approval non-obligatory. This contradicts the original intent of strict brand control.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law, where consistent brand usage is crucial to protecting the value of the mark. Disregarding consistent standards can create scenarios of brand dilution and infringement.",

                "changed_text": "Zynga will use reasonable efforts to inform WPT of potential jurisdictions where advertising Zynga's Licensed Property may present challenges under local laws or regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause creates an obligation for Zynga to advise WPT about illegal advertising jurisdictions 'to Zynga's knowledge.' The modified clause weakens this obligation by changing 'shall advise' to 'will use reasonable efforts to inform,' making the advisory role discretionary rather than mandatory. The term 'potential challenges' also softens the original statement's impact regarding illegal advertising.",
                "contradicted_law": "Advertising standards and regulations vary greatly by jurisdiction; this change can lead to breaches of advertising law, creating a risk of legal repercussions for WPT as they may not be fully informed of the applicable jurisdictions' rules.",

                "changed_text": "Each party is encouraged to maintain liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a definite obligation ('agrees to carry') with a mere suggestion ('is encouraged to maintain'). This weakens the enforceability of ensuring adequate risk coverage, turning a contractual duty into a non-binding recommendation.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law, as the original provides a definite and measurable obligation that can be enforced, while the modified language makes it difficult to determine whether the party is fulfilling any obligation at all. It also opens the possibility that one party would not be able to cover damages, thus making a mockery of indemnity provisions.",

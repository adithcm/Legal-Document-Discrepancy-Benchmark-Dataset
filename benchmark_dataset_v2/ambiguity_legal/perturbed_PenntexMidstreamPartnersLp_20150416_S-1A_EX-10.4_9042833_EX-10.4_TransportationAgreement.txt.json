                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Transporter will receive Customer Gas at the prevailing pressure at which such Customer Gas is delivered to the applicable Point of Receipt by the operator of the applicable Plant.",
                "changed_text": "Transporter will endeavor to receive Customer Gas at the prevailing pressure at which such Customer Gas is delivered to the applicable Point of Receipt by the operator of the applicable Plant.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will receive' to 'will endeavor to receive' weakens the obligation on the Transporter to receive the gas at the specified pressure. This creates uncertainty regarding the Transporter's commitment and allows for discretionary non-compliance. This could contradict Louisiana regulations concerning pipeline safety and operational standards, as consistent pressure management is crucial for safe gas transportation.",

                "changed_text": "Each Measurement Facility should generally be constructed, installed, owned, operated and maintained by Transporter.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall' to 'should generally' introduces ambiguity. This weakens the previously clear obligation for Transporter to handle all aspects of the measurement facility. The added word 'generally' provides an opportunity for Transporter to not maintain the measurement facilities, which contradicts standards of measurement accuracy and reliability in gas transportation under Louisiana law, potentially leading to inaccurate billing and disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 30. Minerals, Oil, and Gas ยง 571 et seq. relating to accurate measurement and reporting of natural gas volumes.",

                "changed_text": "Customer shall pay Transporter a transportation fee, ideally $0.04 per MMBtu.",
                "explanation": "The addition of the word 'ideally' makes the fixed transportation fee of $0.04 per MMBtu ambiguous. This could be interpreted to mean that the fee is not guaranteed, which opens it to dispute. Having a transportation fee that is inconsistent, vague, and open to debate might violate Louisiana's established contract law.",

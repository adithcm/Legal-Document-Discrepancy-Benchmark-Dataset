                "explanation": "The original text mandates \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" for commercialization. The modified text weakens this commitment by using terms such as \"should endeavor\", \"aims to\", \"consider\", \"attempts\", and \"try to\", making the obligation vague and discretionary. This reduces the enforceability of the commercialization obligations and allows for multiple interpretations of Licensee's responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The original text states 'Each Party shall reasonably coordinate...' and 'each Party shall provide a copy of all...'. The modified text replaces these phrases with weaker and more ambiguous language such as 'Each Party may coordinate', 'may keep the other party informed about some regulatory developments,' 'might provide a copy of some,' and 'might consider some of the other Party's comments.' This creates uncertainty regarding the level and consistency of coordination required, making it difficult to enforce meaningful collaboration in regulatory activities.

                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for Bioeq to maintain the [***] Agreement. The modified text introduces several ambiguities: 'should try to keep somewhat in effect,' 'will attempt not to significantly breach,' 'might attempt to resolve the issue,' and 'could notify Licensee if Bioeq thinks there's a potential problem.' These changes make Bioeq's obligation discretionary and vague, undermining the assurance that the [***] Agreement, critical for the overall arrangement, will be upheld.

This duty requires parties to act honestly and not frustrate the purpose of the contract.

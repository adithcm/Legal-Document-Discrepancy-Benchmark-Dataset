                "explanation": "Replaced 'will use all commercially reasonable efforts' with 'may attempt to increase promotion', weakening the obligation to a discretionary action. Also, 'increases to levels above' changed to 'approaches levels above' which is ambiguous as it does not guarantee achievement of those levels. This creates uncertainty regarding the required promotional efforts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principle of 'good faith and fair dealing' is undermined. The original clause creates a clear obligation that MediaLinx must actively work to correct low traffic. The modified version is vague enough to allow MediaLinx to do little or nothing to increase traffic, which could be seen as a breach of good faith.",

                "changed_text": "ensure that all agreements with the third parties shall encourage such third\nparty to be generally responsible for products and transactions that\nmay occur on the Co-Branded Site, that such transactions should generally be in accordance with applicable Canadian and US laws and regulations, including privacy\nlaws and including adherence to MediaLinx's standards and guidelines,\nand ensure that such third party",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be wholly responsible' to 'encourage such third party to be generally responsible' dilutes the responsibility. Similarly, 'shall comply' becomes 'should generally be in accordance with' and 'including compliance' becomes 'including adherence'. These changes weaken the binding nature of the requirements for third parties, making compliance uncertain.",
                "contradicted_law": "By weakening the obligation for third parties to comply with Canadian and US laws, especially privacy laws, the clause now contradicts both Canadian privacy laws like PIPEDA and U.S. laws such as HIPAA or COPPA, which require strict compliance and accountability for data handling and transaction security.",

                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'HCI shall ensure' with 'HCI should endeavor,' making the obligation discretionary. 'Maintained at such levels as is found' is changed to 'similar to the levels found,' which is vague. Also, 'in accordance with' becomes 'generally consistent with,' further reducing the strictness of the requirement. This introduces substantial ambiguity in how much Canadian content is required.",
                "contradicted_law": "By weakening the requirement for Canadian content, this clause may conflict with regulations promoting Canadian cultural content online, potentially undermining policies aimed at supporting Canadian content creators and ensuring Canadian cultural representation. While there isn't one single law mandating specific content percentages on websites, the spirit and intent of broadcasting and cultural policies in Canada is undermined.",

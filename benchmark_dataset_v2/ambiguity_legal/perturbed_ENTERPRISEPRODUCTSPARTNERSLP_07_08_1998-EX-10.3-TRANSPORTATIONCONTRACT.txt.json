                "changed_text": "Shipper should attempt to load each shipment to a capacity it believes is reasonable, considering applicable regulations.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall exert its best efforts' to 'should attempt' weakens the obligation. Introducing 'a capacity it believes is reasonable' makes it subjective and open to interpretation. This contradicts DOT regulations that require strict adherence to lawful capacity limits.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall procure and maintain' to 'shall endeavor to obtain' weakens the obligation. Adding 'as understood by the Carrier' introduces subjective interpretation, potentially conflicting with strict compliance requirements of transportation laws. This might not cover all regulatory bases.",

Under no circumstances shall Carrier be obligated to effect delivery of any shipment at a specified time or on a specified day. In consideration of the convenience of the Consignee, Carrier will accept orders calling for preferred delivery periods of either morning (a.m.) or afternoon (p.m.) and will make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, subject to the understanding that failure to arrive during such preferred delivery period will not relieve the Consignee of the responsibility to accept delivery of the shipment tendered during its Normal Business Hours.",
                "changed_text": "Carrier may attempt to handle shipments with what it considers appropriate dispatch and may attempt to deliver shipments during normal business hours when feasible. Carrier's ultimate delivery obligations will depend on various logistical factors and its internal scheduling.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall handle...with reasonable dispatch' with 'may attempt to handle with what it considers appropriate dispatch' introduces subjectivity. The added language about 'various logistical factors' and 'internal scheduling' creates ambiguity that undermines the initial obligation to provide timely delivery, potentially violating contract carriage duties.",

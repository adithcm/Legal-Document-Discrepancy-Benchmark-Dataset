                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Aduro shall pay Consultant for the Services at the rate of €500 per hour. On a monthly basis, Consultant shall submit to Aduro an invoice for the hours worked along with itemized documentation and receipts and other information for pre-approved travel and/or out-of- pocket expenses as Aduro reasonably requests at the time reimbursement is requested. Consultant will not incur any travel and/or other out-of-pocket expenses of more than €5,000 individually or €20,000 in the aggregate without the prior written consent of Aduro. Aduro shall pay Consultant any amounts due that are not reasonably disputed by Aduro, by check or direct bank deposit, within thirty days after receiving the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Aduro will endeavor to pay Consultant for Services at an hourly rate. Consultant should periodically submit invoices for work performed and documentation for expenses when practical. Consultant should attempt to seek prior approval for substantial travel and out-of-pocket expenses. Aduro will remit payment for undisputed amounts in a reasonable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity in the payment terms. Replacing 'shall pay' with 'will endeavor to pay' makes the obligation to pay less definitive. Similarly, replacing 'shall submit' with 'should periodically submit' makes invoicing discretionary. Removing specific limits creates ambiguity on expense reimbursement. Finally, replacing 'within thirty days after receiving the invoice' with 'in a reasonable timeframe' creates uncertainty regarding payment deadlines. This is in conflict with California's prompt payment laws, such as those related to contractor payments.",

                "original_text": "Consultant shall keep all Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant shall not disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except to perform the Services. If Consultant is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant shall promptly notify Aduro to allow Aduro a reasonable time to oppose such process and Consultant shall reasonably cooperate in Aduro's efforts.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant will endeavor to keep Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant should generally avoid disclosing such information except when performing Services. If legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant will attempt to notify Aduro as soon as feasible, and may offer cooperation to the extent possible.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality. Changing 'shall keep' to 'will endeavor to keep' and 'shall not disclose' to 'should generally avoid disclosing' makes the confidentiality obligation less stringent. Furthermore, replacing 'shall promptly notify' with 'will attempt to notify as soon as feasible' and 'shall reasonably cooperate' with 'may offer cooperation to the extent possible' makes the notification and cooperation requirements discretionary. This can create non-compliance with trade secret protection laws in California and also the Defend Trade Secrets Act.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law' to 'Consultant will make good-faith attempts to perform the Services in compliance with applicable laws' weakens the obligation to comply with laws. 'Good-faith attempts' introduces ambiguity and does not guarantee actual compliance, which may contradict various California state and federal laws relevant to consulting services, such as those related to data privacy or non-discrimination.",

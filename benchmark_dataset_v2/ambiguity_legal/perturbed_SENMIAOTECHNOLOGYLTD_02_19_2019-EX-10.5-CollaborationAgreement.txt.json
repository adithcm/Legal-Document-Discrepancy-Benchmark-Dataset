                "original_text": "Party B shall guarantee the authenticity, legality, completeness, accuracy and validity of any materials and information provided by it to Party A, and guarantee that such materials and information are in compliance with this Agreement and the Platform Rules during the Period of Cooperation; and shall guarantee the validity and security of the email address, telephone number, address, postal code, etc., provided by it to Party A, and the successful contact by Party A or the Driver Users with Party B through the aforementioned contact information. In case such materials or information or contact information is changed or invalid, Party B shall notify Party A of the changed information or the invalidity at least 3 working days in advance.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall endeavor to ensure the authenticity, legality, completeness, accuracy, and validity of any materials and information provided by it to Party A, and endeavor to ensure that such materials and information are in general compliance with this Agreement and the Platform Rules during the Period of Cooperation; and shall try to ensure the validity and security of the email address, telephone number, address, postal code, etc., provided by it to Party A, and to facilitate contact by Party A or the Driver Users with Party B through the aforementioned contact information. In case such materials or information or contact information is changed or invalid, Party B should consider notifying Party A of the changed information or the invalidity when practical.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall guarantee' with 'shall endeavor to ensure' and 'try to ensure,' and 'shall notify' with 'should consider notifying when practical.' This weakens Party B's obligation to provide accurate information and maintain valid contact details, and to provide updates within 3 days of changes. By adding the qualifier 'endeavor' makes it uncertain if Party B will deliver this outcome.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 4 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China requires parties to act in good faith, implying a stronger obligation than 'endeavoring to ensure' or 'considering notifying.' The ambiguity introduced weakens this good faith obligation.",

                "original_text": "Party B shall be obliged to verify the actual use of the leased vehicles, assist and ensure that the Driver User purchases corresponding insurance according to the actual use of the leased vehicles; if the leased vehicle is used for online Ride- hailing operation, in case that the provisions of the local Laws on online Ride-hailing insurance are changed within the term of cooperation or the provisions of the local Laws on online Ride-hailing are officially implemented within the term of cooperation, Party B shall inform the Driver User within 3 working days after the change of local Laws and regulations on Ride-hailing or the effective implementation thereof, assist the Driver User and ensure that the insurance of the leased vehicle shall be changed in accordance with the provisions of local Laws on ride-hailing to make the insurance of the leased vehicle comply with the provisions of relevant Laws and regulations on Ride-hailing at that time.",
                "changed_text": "Party B will make reasonable attempts to verify the actual use of the leased vehicles and assist the Driver User in understanding the need to purchase what Party B considers appropriate insurance according to the use of the leased vehicles; if the leased vehicle is used for online Ride- hailing operation, Party B will endeavor to inform the Driver User in a timely manner of any significant changes to local laws on online Ride-hailing insurance and may offer assistance to ensure insurance adjustments, however, responsibility for compliance rests with the Driver User.",
                "explanation": "This section is altered to lessen Party B's responsibility by replacing 'shall be obliged to verify' with 'will make reasonable attempts to verify,' 'assist and ensure' with 'assist the Driver User in understanding the need,' and removing the strict 3-day notification requirement. The phrase 'what Party B considers appropriate insurance' introduces subjectivity. 'Endeavor to inform' and 'may offer assistance' further weaken the obligation, shifting compliance responsibility to the Driver User. The terms 'reasonable' and 'endeavor' are not well defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 64 of the Tort Law of the People's Republic of China assigns liability to the lessor if a vehicle is leased without adequate insurance, leading to damages. By weakening Party B's obligation to ensure proper insurance, this modification could conflict with the Tort Law.",

If the Driver User has paid the maintenance fee and personal injury compensation for the leased vehicle caused by traffic accident or other safety accident, Party B shall pay full insurance premium after deducting the expenses that the Driver User shall pay to Party B (if any) to the Driver User within 1 working day after receiving the insurance compensation.",
                "changed_text": "Where a traffic accident or other safety accident occurs in a leased vehicle, Party B will consider assisting in dealing with relevant matters and may assist in settling insurance claims. If the Driver User has paid the maintenance fee and personal injury compensation for the leased vehicle caused by traffic accident or other safety accident, Party B will aim to remit insurance funds, as it deems feasible, after appropriate deductions, to the Driver User within a reasonable timeframe following the collection of such insurance funds.",
                "explanation": "The changes dilute Party B's obligations by replacing 'shall actively deal' with 'will consider assisting,' and 'shall pay' with 'will aim to remit' and 'deems feasible'. Introducing the terms 'reasonable timeframe' introduces more vagueness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Article 1213 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China implies a duty of care in contractual performance. Reducing the obligation to 'consider assisting' and introducing subjective assessment of 'feasibility' weakens this duty of care.",

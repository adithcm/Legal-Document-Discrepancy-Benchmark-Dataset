                "original_text": "Party B shall guarantee the authenticity, legality, completeness, accuracy and validity of any materials and information provided by it to Party A, and guarantee that such materials and information are in compliance with this Agreement and the Platform Rules during the Period of Cooperation; and shall guarantee the validity and security of the email address, telephone number, address, postal code, etc., provided by it to Party A, and the successful contact by Party A or the Driver Users with Party B through the aforementioned contact information. In case such materials or information or contact information is changed or invalid, Party B shall notify Party A of the changed information or the invalidity at least 3 working days in advance.",
                "changed_text": "Party B should endeavor to ensure the authenticity, legality, completeness, accuracy, and validity of any materials and information provided to Party A, affirming that such materials and information generally comply with this Agreement and the Platform Rules during the Period of Cooperation. Party B should also strive to maintain the validity and security of the provided email address, telephone number, address, postal code, etc., and facilitate contact by Party A or Driver Users where practical. If materials, information, or contact information changes or becomes invalid, Party B may notify Party A of such changes or invalidity when feasible.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the original obligation by changing 'shall guarantee' to 'should endeavor to ensure,' which makes the guarantee less strict. 'Generally comply' introduces ambiguity about the level of compliance required. Replacing 'shall notify' with 'may notify...when feasible' makes the notification of changes discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates ambiguity around Party B's responsibilities for maintaining accurate and valid information. This shift undermines the clear obligation for data accuracy, potentially conflicting with Chinese regulations regarding the accuracy of business information and consumer protection laws that require businesses to provide truthful information.",

                "changed_text": "Party B will use reasonable efforts to verify the actual use of the leased vehicles and assist the Driver User in obtaining appropriate insurance. If the leased vehicle is used for online Ride-hailing operation, and local Laws regarding Ride-hailing insurance change during the term of cooperation or are implemented, Party B will endeavor to inform the Driver User and assist them in adjusting the insurance coverage as they deem appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation makes the obligation to verify vehicle use and ensure appropriate insurance less stringent. Replacing 'shall be obliged to verify' with 'will use reasonable efforts to verify' introduces ambiguity. Furthermore, 'assist the Driver User in obtaining appropriate insurance' is less forceful than 'ensure that the Driver User purchases corresponding insurance.' Changing 'shall inform the Driver User within 3 working days' to 'will endeavor to inform the Driver User' makes the timely notification discretionary. This weakens Party B's responsibility to ensure compliance with local Ride-hailing insurance laws. The phrase 'as they deem appropriate' places the responsibility of what is considered compliant with local laws on the driver user, despite the contract stating that Party B has more expertise.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict performance of the Financial Leasing Agreement, providing a clear and enforceable obligation. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that Party B 'will generally aim to adhere to' the agreement, which suggests a weaker commitment than strict performance. The added phrase 'recognizing that unforeseen circumstances may occasionally arise' further dilutes the obligation, creating potential loopholes for non-compliance. This ambiguity directly undermines the contractual certainty required to enforce the agreement, potentially violating contract law principles that require clear and unambiguous terms for enforceability.",

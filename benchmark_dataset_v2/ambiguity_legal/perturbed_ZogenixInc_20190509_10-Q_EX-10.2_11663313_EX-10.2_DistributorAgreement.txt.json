                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",

                "changed_text": "In the performance of its obligations hereunder, such Party should try to comply and encourage its Affiliates' employees and contractors to comply with Applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'should try to comply' and 'cause to comply' with 'encourage to comply' weakens the obligation, making it suggestive rather than mandatory. This contradicts the strict compliance requirements of various laws like the FCPA and local Japanese regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "FCPA, Japanese anti-corruption laws, general contract law principles requiring good faith and diligent performance.",

This system may provide signal management as well as the collection, identification, evaluation, and management of individual case safety reports and cumulative reports.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall maintain' to 'will endeavor to maintain' and 'will provide' to 'may provide' introduces ambiguity, weakening the commitment to a fully functional risk management system. This contradicts regulatory expectations (including those of the PMDA in Japan and FDA in the US) for consistent and comprehensive pharmacovigilance.",

                "changed_text": "The MAH Party should endeavor to maintain Regulatory Approval for the Product in the Field in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the term 'shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts' with 'should endeavor' weakens the legal obligation. The original clause sets a standard for performance that is measurable, whereas the revised clause introduces discretion. This contradicts the regulatory requirement of maintaining valid and current regulatory approval as required by PMDA.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Reseller shall comply with all applicable export and import control and other relevant laws of any applicable jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller should endeavor to comply with export and import control and other relevant laws of any applicable jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'should endeavor to comply,' the obligation becomes vague and non-mandatory. It's unclear what level of effort constitutes 'endeavoring,' creating ambiguity. This weakens the legal obligation and potentially allows the reseller to avoid strict compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Export and import control laws like the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) in the United States (if applicable due to international commerce aspects) require strict adherence, not just an endeavor to comply.",

                "original_text": "Diversinet shall diligently defend, indemnify and hold Reseller harmless, at its own expense, any action, loss, cost or expense brought against Reseller to the extent that it is based upon a claim that Reseller's use of the unmodified Products as permitted herein infringes upon a third party's intellectual property rights, and will pay the resulting costs, damages and legal fees finally awarded against Reseller through settlement, judgment, arbitration, mediation or otherwise in such action that are attributable to such claim",
                "changed_text": "Diversinet shall, to the extent reasonably practical, defend, indemnify and hold Reseller harmless, at an expense deemed reasonable by Diversinet, any action, loss, cost or expense brought against Reseller to the extent that it is based upon a claim that Reseller's use of the unmodified Products as permitted herein infringes upon a third party's intellectual property rights, and will pay the resulting costs, damages and legal fees finally awarded against Reseller through settlement, judgment, arbitration, mediation or otherwise in such action that are demonstrably attributable to such claim.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall diligently defend' to 'shall, to the extent reasonably practical, defend' and 'at its own expense' to 'at an expense deemed reasonable by Diversinet' introduces ambiguity and discretion for Diversinet. Also, making the damages 'demonstrably attributable' adds a high burden of proof. This weakens the indemnification obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles typically require indemnification clauses to be clear and enforceable. These changes make the clause less certain, which is less compatible with a standard indemnification obligation.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Parties agree to execute an escrow agreement, within 90 days of the Effective Date, with a nationally recognized escrow agent with respect to the source code for the Products and name Reseller as a beneficiary. Diversinet will then immediately send a copy of the escrow agreement to Reseller for its counter-signature. Diversinet shall, at least annually, deposit the source code in the escrow account.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties should consider executing an escrow agreement, within a reasonable timeframe of the Effective Date, with an escrow service. Diversinet will then send a copy of the agreement to Reseller. Diversinet will periodically deposit the source code in an account.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'agree to execute' to 'should consider executing' makes the escrow agreement optional. The change from '90 days' to 'reasonable timeframe' is vague. Changing 'nationally recognized escrow agent' to 'escrow service' broadens the scope and decreases the quality. Changing 'at least annually' to 'periodically' reduces the frequency and makes it ambiguous. These changes create uncertainty about whether an escrow agreement will actually be in place and when the source code will be deposited.",
                "contradicted_law": "In software licensing, escrow agreements are designed to provide assurance of business continuity in case the licensor fails. This change weakens this assurance by making the escrow agreement's existence and terms uncertain.",

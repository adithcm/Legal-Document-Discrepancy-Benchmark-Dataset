                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation, making compliance subject to interpretation and effort rather than strict adherence. This introduces ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'professional and good judgement' to 'attempt to exercise reasonable judgement' weakens the commitment to a defined standard of care. 'Reasonable' is subjective and less stringent than 'professional and good', creating ambiguity. Also changing 'shall exercise' to 'shall attempt to exercise', weakens the legal obligation. ",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires a clear standard of performance, and this change could allow Diversinet to perform its obligations with less than optimal judgment, potentially breaching implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'meet or exceed industry standards' with 'believes are generally consistent with prevailing practices' introduces ambiguity. Prevailing practices is vague and does not necessarily equate to industry standards, which are more concrete and defined. 'Believes' adds a subjective element. This creates a weaker and less enforceable obligation.",

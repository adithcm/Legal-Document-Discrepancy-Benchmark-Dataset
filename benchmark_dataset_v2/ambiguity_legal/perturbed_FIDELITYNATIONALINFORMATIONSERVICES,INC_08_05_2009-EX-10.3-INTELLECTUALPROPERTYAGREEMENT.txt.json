                "original_text": "(b) Each party shall, and shall ensure that each member of its Group shall, (i) receive and hold the Company Information of the other Group in trust and in strictest confidence; (ii) protect such Company Information from disclosure and in no event take any action causing, or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent, any such Company Information to lose its character as Company Information; (iii) exercise at a minimum the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information; and (iv) not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Company Information of the other Group, (A) except as authorized pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (B) except pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure; provided, however, with respect to disclosures pursuant to (B) above, the receiving party must first give written notice of such required disclosure to the disclosing party, take reasonable steps to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed, make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Company Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which disclosure is required, and shall disclose only that part of the Company Information 24 which, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. In no event shall the receiving party exercise less than a reasonable standard of care to keep confidential the Company Information. Any and all reproductions of such Company Information must prominently contain a confidential legend.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Each party will endeavor to ensure that each member of its Group (i) attempts to hold the Company Information of the other Group in confidence; (ii) considers protecting such Company Information from disclosure and may take action to prevent, any such Company Information to lose its character as Company Information; (iii) consider to exercise the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information; and (iv) consider not to use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Company Information of the other Group, (A) except as authorized pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (B) except pursuant to a possible requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure; provided, however, with respect to disclosures pursuant to (B) above, the receiving party should first give reasonable notice of such possible disclosure to the disclosing party, attempts to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed, attempts to make reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Company Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which disclosure is required, and may disclose any part of the Company Information 24 which, in its opinion, it is required to disclose. In no event shall the receiving party exercise a reasonable standard of care to keep confidential the Company Information. Any and all reproductions of such Company Information must prominently contain a confidential legend.",
                "explanation": "The modifications significantly weaken the obligations to protect confidential information. Replacing 'shall' with terms like 'will endeavor,' 'attempts to,' 'considers,' and 'should' makes the actions discretionary rather than mandatory. Also the clause \"reasonable notice of such possible disclosure to the disclosing party\" is more vague than the original's \"give written notice of such required disclosure to the disclosing party\". This creates ambiguity around whether a party is truly obligated to protect confidential information, leading to potential disputes over compliance. Also the clause \"receiving party may disclose any part of the Company Information 24 which, in its opinion, it is required to disclose.\" is problematic as it allows the party to disclose confidential information without having legal counsel.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) establishes federal protections for trade secrets. By weakening the obligation to protect confidential information, the modified clause could be interpreted as a failure to take reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, potentially violating the DTSA if the information qualifies as a trade secret.",

                "original_text": "From time to time, at Certegy's request and without further consideration, Equifax shall, and shall cause each member of the Equifax Group, as applicable, to execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents, instruments or assurances and take such other action as Certegy may reasonably request to more effectively assign, convey and transfer any of the Transferred Equifax Assets and the Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements.",
                "changed_text": "From time to time, upon request of Certegy and without further consideration, Equifax will consider executing, acknowledging, and delivering documents, instruments, or assurances, and may take other actions as Certegy deems appropriate to assign, convey, and transfer the Transferred Equifax Assets and Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'will consider' and 'may take,' the obligation of Equifax to execute documents for the transfer of assets becomes discretionary. Replacing 'Certegy may reasonably request' with 'Certegy deems appropriate' also shifts the power balance, potentially allowing Certegy to demand actions beyond what is reasonable or legally required. This weakens the legal enforceability of the asset transfer.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires parties to fulfill their contractual obligations in good faith. By making the asset transfer process discretionary, the modified clause may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing if Equifax unreasonably refuses to cooperate in the transfer of assets, especially those that are legally required.",

                "original_text": "Upon written request, Equifax and Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of its Group to, use reasonable efforts to cooperate in the evaluation and defense of third party Actions arising out of the business of the other party or of any member of the other party's Group prior to the Distribution Date in which the requesting party or any member of its Group may from time to time be involved, at the cost and expense of the requesting party. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, making its Representatives available as witnesses or consultants to the extent that such persons may reasonably be required in connection with such third party Actions.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written request, Equifax and Certegy may use efforts to cooperate in the evaluation and defense of third-party Actions that relate to the business of the other party prior to the Distribution Date. The requesting party will cover the costs and expenses of such cooperation. Such cooperation might include making Representatives available as witnesses or consultants if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall' with 'may use efforts,' the obligation to cooperate in defending third-party actions becomes optional. Removing 'reasonable' and replacing it with 'might include' further weakens the requirement. The phrase 'if deemed appropriate' gives each party unilateral discretion over whether to assist, making the legal obligation uncertain and difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "While there is no direct violation of a specific law, the weakened cooperation clause could hinder the ability of one party to adequately defend itself in litigation. This could create non-compliance issues with court orders related to discovery or witness testimony if a party is unable to compel cooperation from the other party as originally intended.",

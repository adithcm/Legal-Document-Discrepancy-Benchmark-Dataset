                "original_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall, and as the case may be, shall cause the member of its respective Group which is the holder of such Transferred Asset or Transferred Third Party Agreement prior to transfer, to use all reasonable efforts to provide to the applicable member of the other Group all the rights and benefits under such Transferred Asset or Transferred Third Party Agreement and to cause such holder to enforce such Transferred Asset or Transferred Third Party Agreement for the benefit of such member of the other Group; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation shall not, in any way, require Equifax, Certegy or any member of a respective Group to breach any Transferred Third Party Agreement or incur or suffer any liability with respect to any Transferred Third Party Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Equifax and Certegy should, as they deem appropriate, encourage the member of its respective Group which is the holder of such Transferred Asset or Transferred Third Party Agreement prior to transfer, to try and provide the applicable member of the other Group some of the rights and benefits under such Transferred Asset or Transferred Third Party Agreement. However, this encouragement does not mandate any specific action.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a clear obligation to 'use all reasonable efforts' to provide rights and benefits under transferred assets. The modified version introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'should encourage,' making the action non-mandatory and discretionary. The phrase 'try and provide some of the rights and benefits' further weakens the obligation, and the final sentence explicitly states no specific action is mandated, contradicting the intent of a legally binding transfer.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - By creating a discretionary rather than mandatory obligation for transferring asset rights, the modification introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the contract, potentially leading to a breach if asset transfer is not effectively executed. According to contract law principles, valid contracts must have clear and definite terms. Ambiguity in key terms can render a contract unenforceable. This violates general contract law principles.",

                "original_text": "Certegy will terminate the use of such Equifax Marks as soon as commercially practical but in any event within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.",
                "changed_text": "Certegy will consider terminating the use of such Equifax Marks when it is somewhat feasible, potentially within roughly twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates termination of Equifax Marks within a defined timeframe. The modified version introduces ambiguity by changing 'will terminate' to 'will consider terminating,' making the action discretionary. The phrases 'when it is somewhat feasible' and 'potentially within roughly twelve (12) months' further weaken the obligation, contradicting the original definitive timeline and the need for clear contractual terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark Law - Continuing to use Equifax marks beyond a reasonable transition period, especially if done in a way that confuses consumers, could infringe on Equifax's trademark rights. Ambiguity about when the marks must be terminated creates uncertainty that could facilitate trademark infringement. This violates basic principles of trademark law, which seek to prevent consumer confusion and protect brand identity.",

                "original_text": "Each party shall, and shall ensure that each member of its Group shall, (i) receive and hold the Company Information of the other Group in trust and in strictest confidence; (ii) protect such Company Information from disclosure and in no event take any action causing, or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent, any such Company Information to lose its character as Company Information; (iii) exercise at a minimum the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information; and (iv) not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Company Information of the other Group, (A) except as authorized pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (B) except pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure; provided, however, with respect to disclosures pursuant to (B) above, the receiving party must first give written notice of such required disclosure to the disclosing party, take reasonable steps to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed, make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Company Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which disclosure is required, and shall disclose only that part of the Company Information which, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. In no event shall the receiving party exercise less than a reasonable standard of care to keep confidential the Company Information. Any and all reproductions of such Company Information must prominently contain a confidential legend.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should, as they deem appropriate, try to receive and hold the Company Information of the other Group with some level of confidentiality. Parties may take actions to protect Company Information, but are not strictly obligated to prevent its loss of confidentiality. Parties should exercise a level of care when protecting the information. Parties might use Company Information, reproduce, distribute, or disclose it if authorized by this Agreement or required by law. In such cases, providing notice to the disclosing party is optional, and the receiving party may disclose information as they see fit.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a strong confidentiality clause that provides clear obligations for protecting Company Information. The modified text weakens this clause by replacing 'shall' with 'should try', and removing many of the specific actions that are needed to protect the confidentiality of the said information. It also makes any notice requirement optional, making the confidentiality clauses ambiguous and discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Law - By weakening the confidentiality obligations, the modified language fails to provide the level of protection required to maintain trade secret status for confidential information. Under trade secret law, reasonable efforts must be made to maintain secrecy. This violates basic principles of trade secret law.",

                "original_text": "The Company will make Updates to the Service in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Specifications at no charge for the entire term of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Service shall be updated from time to time during the term of this Agreement to include accurate and current (i) Listings and (ii) pricing and service descriptions for each carrier supported by the Manifest, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Company of such Listings, pricing and service descriptions.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to provide Updates to the Service, potentially aligning with the Specifications, at no charge for the duration of this Agreement. The Service may be updated periodically during the term of this Agreement to include reasonably accurate and current (i) Listings and (ii) pricing and service descriptions for each carrier supported by the Manifest, possibly within a reasonable timeframe following the Company's awareness of such Listings, pricing, and service descriptions.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'will make Updates' with 'will endeavor to provide Updates,' weakening the obligation. 'In accordance with the requirements' is changed to 'potentially aligning with,' which creates ambiguity about whether the specifications will be strictly followed. The phrase 'shall be updated' is replaced with 'may be updated periodically,' making updates discretionary. Finally, 'as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Company' is changed to 'possibly within a reasonable timeframe following the Company's awareness of such Listings,' which introduces vagueness regarding the timeliness of updates. This could conflict with consumer protection laws and regulations governing fair and accurate pricing, particularly if outdated pricing information leads to consumer harm in California where MBE is incorporated.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'shall supply and regularly update' to 'should attempt to supply and update' makes MBE's obligation to provide accurate listing data optional. The change from 'shall include' to 'may include' makes the inclusion of listings discretionary, and 'shall use' to 'might use' weakens the obligation to include the listings on third party websites. This could contradict the **California Franchise Relations Act** if a failure to properly list MBE locations leads to a disadvantage for franchisees and affects the franchise agreement's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use at least the same degree of care which it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party under this Agreement. Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any actual or suspected misuse or unauthorized disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should aim to treat as confidential the Confidential Information of the other party, and will generally not use such Confidential Information except as outlined in this Agreement. Each party should endeavor to use reasonable, but not necessarily consistent, efforts to avoid disclosing such Confidential Information to third parties. While each party should strive to promptly notify the other party of actual misuse of Confidential Information, notification of merely suspected misuse remains discretionary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall treat' with 'should aim to treat' and 'shall not use' with 'will generally not use' weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality. The original 'use at least the same degree of care' is removed entirely, significantly reducing the standard of care. The change from 'shall promptly notify' to 'should strive to promptly notify' makes reporting of misuse of information discretionary, all of which could contradict the **California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA)**, which requires a reasonable and consistent effort to maintain secrecy. Making the reporting of *suspected* misuse discretionary directly conflicts with obligations of due diligence in trade secret protection.",

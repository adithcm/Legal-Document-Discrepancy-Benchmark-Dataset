The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies.",

The trading staff may place orders electronically or contact brokers to place orders, find liquidity, and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group attempts to work with the broker and the account custodian to facilitate the exchange of securities and monies.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'execute' to 'may execute' and 'works with' to 'attempts to work with', the obligation to execute trades and ensure accurate exchange of securities becomes discretionary, rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity about the standard of care required in trade execution and settlement.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires investment advisers to act in the best interest of their clients. This ambiguity undermines this fiduciary duty by allowing for potential negligence in trade execution and settlement, potentially violating Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.",

                "original_text": "The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser.",
                "changed_text": "The equity investment analysts may provide research and analysis of companies within a sector. Analysis might include a review of published reports, occasional interviews of company management, possible on-site observation of company operations, or the use of financial models. Analysts could read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and consider trends within the sector and industry. The analyst may make recommendations to the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken the mandatory nature of the research and analysis process. Replacing 'provide independent research and analysis' with 'may provide research and analysis' and changing mandatory activities (e.g., 'analysis includes review') to optional activities (e.g., 'analysis might include a review') introduces ambiguity about the quality and thoroughness of the research, potentially compromising its independence and reliability.",

By reducing the rigor and independence of research, the Adviser may not fulfill its fiduciary duty, potentially violating the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.",

To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Quantitative analysts may develop and apply financial models that could enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, possibly assess relative risk and perhaps enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers. To the extent that such services are provided, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above might be considered \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'develop and apply' with 'may develop and apply', 'designed to enable' with 'that could enable', 'assess' with 'possibly assess' and 'shall be treated' with 'might be considered' weakens the requirements. The modifications make the application of quantitative analysis discretionary and the categorization of services as 'investment advisory services' uncertain, creating ambiguity around the scope of services and their associated regulatory obligations.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Wildform shall perform the Transition Services for which it is responsible hereunder following commonly accepted standards of care in the industry and exercising the same degree of care as it exercises in performing the same or similar services for its own business as of the date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Wildform should endeavor to perform the Transition Services for which it is responsible hereunder, attempting to meet industry standards of care, and generally trying to exercise a similar level of care as it applies to its own business as of this Agreement's date.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall perform' with 'should endeavor to perform,' 'following commonly accepted standards' with 'attempting to meet industry standards,' and 'exercising the same degree of care' with 'generally trying to exercise a similar level of care.' This weakens the obligation, making it aspirational rather than mandatory and introducing subjectivity.",

                "original_text": "During the first twelve (12) months of the Term, Wildform shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Program Errors within the response times set forth below. For purposes of the response times set forth below a \"Serious\" Program Error shall be defined as a Program Error that (a) causes the Deliverables to crash (malfunction), or (b) substantially degrades the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables. A \"Minor\" Program Error shall be defined as a bug that causes a less than substantial degradation in the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables.",
                "changed_text": "During the first twelve (12) months of the Term, Wildform will consider correcting Program Errors, possibly within the general response times outlined below. The definition of a 'Serious' or 'Minor' Program Error will be based on Wildform's subjective determination of the impact on Deliverables.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will consider correcting Program Errors, possibly within the general response times outlined below', making correction discretionary. Defining errors based on Wildform's 'subjective determination' removes objectivity and contradicts the intent of a clear service level agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; failure to meet the implied standard of good faith and fair dealing, especially with respect to providing necessary support services.",

                "changed_text": "Wildform may, at its discretion, offer assistance to On2 and its designees, with On2 covering related expenses, to aid in the perfecting, securing, and protection of On2's intellectual property and other rights. Wildform's level of engagement will be dependent on its current resources and priorities.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'agrees to give' with 'may, at its discretion, offer' and adding 'Wildform's level of engagement will be dependent on its current resources and priorities', the obligation for assistance becomes optional and subject to Wildform's internal constraints. This creates significant ambiguity, undermining On2's ability to rely on Wildform for IP protection support.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract; Failure to provide necessary assistance for IP protection, making it difficult to prove what 'reasonable assistance' entails, undermining the original intent.",

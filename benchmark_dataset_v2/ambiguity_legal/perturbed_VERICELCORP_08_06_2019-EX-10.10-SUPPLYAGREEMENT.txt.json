                "original_text": "MediWound shall purchase at its cost and expense all Materials required for Manufacture by MediWound of the Product for supply to Vericel for the Territory pursuant to this Agreement. Any and all forecasts and purchase orders for such Materials shall be placed at MediWound's sole expense and under its sole responsibility. MediWound shall place such purchase orders on a timely basis in order to avoid any undue delay, interruption or other discontinuance in the Manufacture or delivery of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound will endeavor to purchase Materials required for Manufacture of the Product. Any and all forecasts and purchase orders for such Materials may be placed at MediWound's discretion. MediWound will make reasonable efforts to place purchase orders to avoid undue delays.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for MediWound to purchase all necessary materials on a timely basis. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'endeavor to,' 'may be placed at MediWound's discretion,' and 'reasonable efforts,' weakening the obligation. This could lead to MediWound not prioritizing material procurement, potentially causing supply chain disruptions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - This modification introduces uncertainty regarding the enforceability of material procurement, potentially leading to disputes over MediWound's commitment to supply the product as agreed upon in the contract.",

MediWound agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit one or more Vericel representatives to be present for all or part of such visit or inspection if Vericel so requests.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound will attempt to advise Vericel regarding regulatory visits or inspections. MediWound may try to allow Vericel representatives to be present during inspections, should Vericel make a request.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear timeframe ([***]) for MediWound to notify Vericel of regulatory inspections and commits MediWound to use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to allow Vericel representatives to be present. The modified text replaces 'shall advise promptly' with 'will attempt to advise', making the notification discretionary. Replacing 'agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'may try to allow' further weakens the obligation. This could result in Vericel not receiving timely notifications or not being able to participate in crucial regulatory inspections.",

MediWound and Vericel shall, at Vericel's expense (unless the result is due to a material breach of MediWound of any of its obligations under this Agreement), (a) cooperate to determine the cause for any identified issues, (b) work together in good faith to develop a corrective action, and (c) endeavor to implement such corrective action within a mutually agreed time period thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "Observations from Vericel's audits may be shared with MediWound. MediWound and Vericel might attempt to cooperate on addressing identified issues, possibly working together to develop a corrective action, and may consider implementing such corrective action within a time period they find agreeable.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains mandatory language that promotes collaboration to find the root causes and correct the issues. The changes promote the notion that these observations might be shared, and that there could be a coorperative attempt to correct the issues. This does not bind Mediwound into the obligation to fix the issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 211 - This undermines the cGMP requirements for transparency and collaboration between manufacturer and client during quality audits, especially concerning drug manufacturing. And introduces ambiguity, which is illegal.",

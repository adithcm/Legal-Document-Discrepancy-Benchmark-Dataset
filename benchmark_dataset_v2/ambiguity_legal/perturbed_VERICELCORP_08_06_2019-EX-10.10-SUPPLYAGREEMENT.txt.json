                "original_text": "MediWound shall advise Vericel promptly, but in any event within [***] on becoming aware of an authorized agent of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder and in connection with the Manufacturing of the Products. MediWound agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit one or more Vericel representatives to be present for all or part of such visit or inspection if Vericel so requests.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound should endeavor to advise Vericel in a timely fashion on becoming aware of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel for the Territory. MediWound may allow Vericel representatives to be present for such visit or inspection if mutually convenient.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall advise promptly, but in any event within [***]' to 'should endeavor to advise in a timely fashion' introduces ambiguity regarding the exact timeframe for notification. Replacing 'agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit' with 'may allow if mutually convenient' makes Vericel's presence at the inspection discretionary. This contradicts FDA regulations, which mandate clear and timely communication during regulatory inspections, potentially hindering Vericel's ability to ensure compliance and address issues promptly.",

                "original_text": "MediWound shall use reasonable commercial efforts to furnish to Vericel a copy of all material information supplied and/or issued by any Regulatory Authority to the extent that such report relates to the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, or the ability of MediWound or the Suppliers to so Manufacture or supply hereunder, within [***] of its receipt of such information.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound will attempt to furnish Vericel with information supplied by any Regulatory Authority to the extent such report relates to the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, or the ability of MediWound or the Suppliers to so Manufacture or supply hereunder.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'reasonable commercial efforts' and 'within [***] of its receipt of such information' weakens the obligation to provide timely and complete information. The changed text doesn't specify a deadline, and the degree of effort is vaguely 'attempt to', making it hard to enforce timely disclosure of crucial regulatory information. This could breach FDA's requirements for prompt reporting of regulatory concerns which are usually under set timelines, which are now made ambigious.",

                "changed_text": "MediWound should aim to provide regulatory correspondence related to the Product in a timely manner.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the definitive timeframe 'as soon as possible but in no event less than [***]' with the vague term 'in a timely manner' creates ambiguity. This introduces uncertainty about the required speed of information transfer, hindering Vericel's capability to react appropriately to regulatory demands. Therefore, this goes against transparency protocols and established federal standards regarding communication.",

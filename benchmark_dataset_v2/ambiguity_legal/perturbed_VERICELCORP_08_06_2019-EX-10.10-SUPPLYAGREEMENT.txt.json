                "original_text": "MediWound shall advise Vericel promptly, but in any event within [***] on becoming aware of an authorized agent of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder and in connection with the Manufacturing of the Products. MediWound agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit one or more Vericel representatives to be present for all or part of such visit or inspection if Vericel so requests.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound should endeavor to advise Vericel in a timely manner on becoming aware of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel. MediWound may consider allowing Vericel representatives to be present for such visit or inspection if deemed appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates MediWound to advise Vericel promptly about regulatory inspections and to use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to allow Vericel representatives to be present. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'shall advise' to 'should endeavor to advise,' making the notification less mandatory. Similarly, 'agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit' is replaced with 'may consider allowing if deemed appropriate,' making Vericel's presence discretionary rather than an obligation. This creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce Vericel's right to be informed and present during inspections.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 211 (CGMP regulations) requires manufacturers to maintain thorough documentation of regulatory inspections and to ensure that quality control procedures are followed. By making the notification and Vericel's presence discretionary, the modified text conflicts with the spirit of transparency and cooperation expected under CGMP regulations.",

                "original_text": "MediWound shall maintain and shall cause each Supplier to maintain all Manufacturing records, including packaging, analytical and stability records, all records of shipment, and all validation data relating to the Product Manufactured and supplied to Vericel hereunder for the Territory to the extent and for the time periods required by applicable Regulatory Standards with respect to such Product. MediWound shall make such records and data available for Vericel's review on Vericel's reasonable request as mutually agreed by the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound will attempt to maintain Manufacturing records, including packaging, analytical, and shipment records, and validation data relating to the Product supplied to Vericel for the Territory, as deemed reasonably necessary. MediWound will consider making such records available for Vericel's review if mutually convenient.",
                "explanation": "The original text firmly requires MediWound and its suppliers to maintain manufacturing records to the extent and for the time periods required by applicable Regulatory Standards and to make these records available for Vericel's review upon reasonable request. The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall maintain' to 'will attempt to maintain', replacing 'required by applicable Regulatory Standards' with 'as deemed reasonably necessary', and changing 'shall make such records and data available' to 'will consider making such records available if mutually convenient.' This weakens the obligation to maintain and provide records, making compliance discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 211 (CGMP regulations) mandates strict record-keeping requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing. By making record maintenance and access discretionary, the modified text conflicts with the detailed and mandatory record-keeping requirements under CGMP.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall perform the duties required of it pursuant to a quality agreement to be entered into by the Parties within [***] of the execution of this Agreement (the \"Quality Agreement\"). To the extent the Quality Agreement either conflicts with this Agreement or is silent on an issue addressed, this Agreement shall control, except to the extent the matter is strictly a quality matter, in which event the Quality Agreement shall supersede this Agreement solely with respect to such quality matter.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will consider performing the duties outlined in a quality agreement to be discussed by the Parties. If the Quality Agreement is in conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement will generally control, unless both parties agree that the Quality Agreement should take precedence.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes the performance of duties under the Quality Agreement mandatory. It also establishes a clear hierarchy between the Supply Agreement and the Quality Agreement in case of conflict, giving precedence to the Quality Agreement in strictly quality matters. The modified text changes 'shall perform' to 'will consider performing,' making the adherence to duties discretionary. The language 'unless both parties agree that the Quality Agreement should take precedence' introduces further ambiguity and shifts the decision-making process from a defined rule to a mutual agreement, weakening the enforcement of quality standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "21 CFR Part 211.22 mandates that there shall be a quality control unit(s) with the responsibility and authority to approve or reject all components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, packaging material, labeling, and drug products, and the authority to review production records to assure that no errors have occurred or, if errors have occurred, that they have been fully investigated. By weakening the obligation to adhere to a Quality Agreement and making quality control decisions subject to mutual agreement rather than established quality standards, the modified text undermines the independence and authority of the quality control unit, potentially conflicting with FDA regulations.",

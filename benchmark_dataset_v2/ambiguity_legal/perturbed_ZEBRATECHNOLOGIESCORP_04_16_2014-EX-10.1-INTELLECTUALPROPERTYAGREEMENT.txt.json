                "original_text": "Purchaser will cause each Purchaser Licensee, following the Initial Closing Date, to include appropriate Trademark notices as required by applicable Law in connection with each of their respective uses of the Licensed Trademarks. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all use of the Licensed Trademarks by the Purchaser Licensees following the Initial Closing Date and all goodwill associated therewith shall inure to the benefit of the Seller.",

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the goodwill associated with the Licensed Trademarks should generally benefit the Seller.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'cause each Purchaser Licensee to include appropriate Trademark notices as required by applicable Law' with 'encourage each Purchaser Licensee to include Trademark notices.' This weakens the obligation to comply with applicable trademark law, making it discretionary rather than mandatory. Additionally, changing 'all goodwill associated therewith shall inure to the benefit of the Seller' to 'the goodwill associated with the Licensed Trademarks should generally benefit the Seller' introduces vagueness regarding the actual beneficiary of the goodwill, potentially contradicting trademark law requirements for maintaining trademark rights. 'Should generally' is subjective and open to interpretation.",

Purchaser will (and will cause each Purchaser Licensee to) reasonably cooperate with Seller in facilitating Seller's control of such quality, permit reasonable inspection of the Purchaser Licensees' operations (upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours) solely with respect to their respective use of the Licensed Trademarks (if any), and supply Seller with specimens of any of their respective uses of the Licensed Trademarks (if any), including such specimens that are advertising or marketing materials, upon Seller's reasonable request, at Seller's expense.",
                "changed_text": "Purchaser anticipates that the quality of products and services marketed or sold by the Purchaser Licensees under the Licensed Trademarks will generally align with the level of quality of the Enterprise Products. Purchaser will cooperate with Seller as needed to discuss quality control measures, and may consider allowing inspection of the Purchaser Licensees' operations with respect to their use of the Licensed Trademarks, if deemed necessary, and may provide specimens of uses of Licensed Trademarks if easily accessible.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear obligation for the Purchaser to ensure the quality of products and services marketed under the licensed trademarks. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'agrees that the quality...will conform to at least the level of quality' with 'anticipates that the quality...will generally align with the level of quality.' This makes the quality standard less stringent and more subjective. Additionally, changing 'Purchaser will (and will cause each Purchaser Licensee to) reasonably cooperate...permit reasonable inspection...and supply Seller with specimens' to 'Purchaser will cooperate...as needed to discuss quality control measures, and may consider allowing inspection...and may provide specimens if easily accessible' makes the cooperation, inspection, and supply of specimens discretionary rather than mandatory. These changes introduce ambiguity and weaken the Purchaser's commitment to maintaining the quality of products and services under the licensed trademarks, potentially conflicting with trademark law requirements for maintaining trademark rights.",

To the extent that such materials, Software, information, tangible embodiments, and other tangible things constitute, comprise or relate to any Intellectual Property licensed to Seller under Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d) or the Licensed IP, the Seller shall be permitted to retain a reasonable number of copies of such documents, materials, Software, information, tangible embodiments, and other tangible things.

The Purchaser should make diligent efforts to independently locate and obtain the required information.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines the Seller's obligation to provide materials related to the IP. The revised text replaces the obligatory 'the Seller shall...use Reasonable Efforts to provide' with the permissive 'the Seller may, if reasonably practical and without undue burden, attempt to provide'. This significantly weakens the obligation, making it optional rather than required. Also, by adding 'subject to existing resource availability and internal priorities,' it gives the Seller wide discretion to avoid providing the materials. Shifting the responsibility to the Purchaser with, \"The Purchaser should make diligent efforts to independently locate and obtain the required information,\" further diminishes the seller's obligation. This contradicts requirements for full disclosure and transfer of necessary resources in IP agreements.",

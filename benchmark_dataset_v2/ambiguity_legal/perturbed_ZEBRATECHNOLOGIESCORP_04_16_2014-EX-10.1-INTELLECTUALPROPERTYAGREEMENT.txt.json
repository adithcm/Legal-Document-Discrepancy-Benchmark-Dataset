                "original_text": "Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred IP is free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and obligations under applicable SDO agreements with SDOs listed on Schedule 3.8 of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule) and, as of the Initial Closing Date, will be fully transferable, alienable, and licensable by the Purchaser Assignees and Acquired Companies without restriction and without payment to any Person and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(b) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, no Person has an option to take an assignment or license of any Transferred IP.",
                "changed_text": "Except as generally indicated on Schedule 3.2(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred IP should be largely free and clear of significant Encumbrances (excluding Permitted Encumbrances and obligations under possible SDO agreements with SDOs perhaps listed on Schedule 3.8 of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule) and, as of the Initial Closing Date, should generally be transferable, alienable, and licensable by the Purchaser Assignees and Acquired Companies, potentially with some restrictions and payments to certain Persons and, except as noted on Schedule 3.2(b) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule, no Person may have an option to perhaps take an assignment or license of some Transferred IP.",
                "explanation": "This introduces significant ambiguity regarding the encumbrances on the transferred IP. Changing 'is free and clear' to 'should be largely free and clear' and 'will be fully transferable' to 'should generally be transferable' makes the obligation vague. Adding qualifiers such as 'potentially,' 'perhaps,' and 'some' further weakens the assurance of clear title. The language suggests that the transferability may not be guaranteed and could be subject to undisclosed restrictions or payments. This contradicts standard commercial law practices that require clear and definite terms for asset transfers, making this section unenforceable under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - Article 2 regarding the sale of goods requires clear and definite terms for the transfer of title. Ambiguous language regarding encumbrances and transferability creates uncertainty and potential legal disputes.",

                "changed_text": "Purchaser generally agrees that the quality of most Seller Excluded Products and certain other products and services marketed or sold by the Purchaser Licensees under the Licensed Trademarks should endeavor to conform to approximately the level of quality of the Enterprise Products as previously provided by the Seller Entities around the Initial Closing Date.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation to maintain product quality. Changing 'agrees' to 'generally agrees' introduces doubt about the commitment. 'Will conform to at least the level of quality' becomes 'should endeavor to conform to approximately the level of quality,' making the standard subjective and difficult to enforce. The phrase 'as previously provided by the Seller Entities around the Initial Closing Date' also adds ambiguity because it is not clear when the products were exactly sold for comparison. This ambiguity could make it unenforceable to the original expectation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires clear and definite terms. The ambiguous language weakens the assurance of quality control, leading to unenforceability of quality standard.",

                "original_text": "The Seller shall provide (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to provide) to Purchaser within ninety (90) days of the Initial Closing Date, complete and accurate copies of, any IP policies, other licensing commitments, and generally applicable member requirements that are associated with any SDO listed on Schedule 3.8(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule and complete copies of all IP declarations, pledges, commitments, and other statements that any Seller Party has made in association with the Transferred IP, in all cases, with respect to each such copy, to the extent that Purchaser cannot obtain such copy using Reasonable Efforts and Seller is not prohibited from providing such copy to Purchaser).",
                "changed_text": "The Seller may attempt to provide (and may ask the other Seller Parties to provide) to Purchaser within a reasonable timeframe after the Initial Closing Date, ostensibly complete copies of, potentially relevant IP policies, possibly applicable licensing commitments, and purportedly generally applicable member requirements that might be associated with any SDO arguably listed on Schedule 3.8(a) of the Seller IPA Disclosure Schedule and copies of some IP declarations, pledges, soft commitments, and statements that any Seller Party may have vaguely made in connection with the Transferred IP, only if the Purchaser absolutely cannot obtain such copy using Herculean Efforts and Seller is vaguely not prohibited from providing such copy to Purchaser).",
                "explanation": "The language is modified to create several layers of ambiguity. 'Shall provide' is changed to 'may attempt to provide' and 'may ask', indicating a lack of definitive obligation. Terms like 'complete and accurate' are replaced with weaker and more subjective qualifiers like 'ostensibly complete', 'potentially relevant', 'possibly applicable', and 'purportedly generally applicable.' The timeline is shifted from a definite 'ninety (90) days' to a vague 'reasonable timeframe'. Replacing 'Reasonable Efforts' with 'Herculean Efforts' drastically changes the burden of proof.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use its best efforts' to 'shall endeavor' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' is less stringent than 'best efforts,' making it difficult to enforce a specific level of promotion. Also, changing 'shall assist' to 'may assist' makes the assistance optional instead of required. This introduces ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Creates an ambiguous obligation that undermines the original intent of a clear, enforceable promotional commitment; therefore rendering it unenforceable. While not a direct violation of a specific law, it undermines the enforceability of a contract clause, which has broad legal ramifications.",

                "explanation": "This revision introduces vagueness in several ways. Changing 'shall provide' to 'will, when practical' makes the provision of information conditional. Replacing 'as XC shall request' with 'as XC deems necessary' shifts the control over the information provided. Replacing shall indemnify to will attempt to indemnify weakens the legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933 - Specifically, Section 11 regarding liability for false registration statements. By weakening the indemnification clause to 'will attempt to indemnify,' the modified text undermines the protections afforded to investors against material misstatements or omissions in registration statements, potentially conflicting with the requirements for accurate and complete disclosure.",

                "explanation": "The original text had a clear obligation to prevent any adverse impact. The changed text weakens this by using 'will attempt to avoid' (weakens the obligation), 'may conceivably lead' (introduces uncertainty) and 'potential negative effect' (is vague compared to adverse impact).",

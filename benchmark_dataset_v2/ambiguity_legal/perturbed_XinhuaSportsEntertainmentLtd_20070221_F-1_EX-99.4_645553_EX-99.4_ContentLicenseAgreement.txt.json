                "changed_text": "CEIS shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Content is generally available to XFN.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'best endeavours' with 'reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation. 'Generally available' introduces further ambiguity, making continuous, uninterrupted real-time availability uncertain. This contradicts the expected standard of continuous service in financial information agreements.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'complies' to 'believes...generally adheres' significantly weakens the warranty. It introduces a subjective element and does not guarantee actual compliance, creating a loophole for potential violations of laws such as data protection or financial regulations in Hong Kong.",

                "explanation": "Replaced 'agrees' with 'may consider' and changed 'reasonably request' to 'suggests.' This introduces a discretionary element, making any action non-obligatory. The removal of the compliance requirement with 'applicable laws' directly contradicts the intention to adhere to laws in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China, rendering the clause unenforceable.

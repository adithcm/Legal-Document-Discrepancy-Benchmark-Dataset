                "changed_text": "CEIS will attempt to ensure that the Content is made available to XFN.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a strong obligation for continuous real-time delivery. Replacing 'shall use its best endeavours to ensure' with 'will attempt to ensure' weakens this obligation, making the continuous and real-time delivery of content discretionary rather than mandatory. It will create uncertainty regarding the level of effort CEIS must exert to maintain the content feed, potentially leading to disputes over service level agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that XFN has no obligation to review the content for accuracy or compliance. Modifying it to 'XFN may choose to edit' creates ambiguity. While it still doesn't mandate review, it implies a potential responsibility or expectation of doing so. It will allow XFN to claim they are not responsible, or may create confusion on the level of control XFN is doing on the content provided.",

In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree to amend this Agreement as may be necessary to comply with applicable laws, including without limitation the laws of the People's Republic of China.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may consider taking further action and executing documents if deemed beneficial to the transactions contemplated, in their sole discretion. Amendments to comply with applicable laws, including those of the People's Republic of China, might be explored.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the commitment to further action and compliance. Replacing 'agrees...to take' with 'may consider taking' and adding 'in their sole discretion' makes these actions optional rather than obligatory. Similarly, stating that amendments 'might be explored' dilutes the commitment to complying with applicable laws. Making the compliance discretionary will make it open to dispute.",

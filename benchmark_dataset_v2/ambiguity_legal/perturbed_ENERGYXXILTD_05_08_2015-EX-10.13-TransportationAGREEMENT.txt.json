                "original_text": "Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and all applicable Laws, Transporter shall accept and transport Shipper's Crude Petroleum and redeliver the quantity of Crude Petroleum received by Transporter, less applicable Losses as set forth in Section 7.3, at the Delivery Point. Transporter shall be under no obligation to deliver the identical Crude Petroleum received, and reserves the right to make delivery out of its common stock.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Transporter will endeavor to accept and transport Shipper's Crude Petroleum and redeliver a quantity of Crude Petroleum, less potential Losses as generally described in Section 7.3, at the Delivery Point. Transporter shall be under no obligation to deliver the identical Crude Petroleum received, and may attempt to make delivery out of its common stock.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall accept and transport' with 'will endeavor to accept and transport' and 'shall be' with 'may attempt to be,' making the action discretionary rather than mandatory. The wording 'potential losses as generally described' reduces the clarity of the obligation to redeliver. This contradicts the common carrier obligation often imposed on pipelines under state and federal law, requiring them to provide transportation services without undue discrimination.",

                "changed_text": "Shipper, upon request by Transporter, should consider installing, maintaining, and operating, or explore making arrangements with platform owners to install, maintain, and operate equipment to inject corrosion inhibitors, biocides, scale inhibitors, paraffin chemicals, or other chemicals as possibly specified by Transporter.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the binding nature of the obligation by replacing 'shall install, maintain and operate' with 'should consider installing, maintaining and operating' and 'as specified by Transporter' with 'as possibly specified by Transporter'. This introduces ambiguity and makes the requirement to inject chemicals discretionary rather than mandatory which may conflict with regulations related to pipeline integrity and environmental protection.",

The information may include: (i) a rough estimate of when production will start from the acidized well; (ii) a general idea of when production from the acidized well, neutralized to a pH around 4.5, will be injected into the Gathering System; and (iii) a vague timeframe for when fluids from previously acidized wells, neutralized to an approximate pH of 4.5, will be free of neutralized acids.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement to provide information by replacing 'shall furnish' with 'should attempt to furnish' and making the timing and specificity of the information optional. This could contradict requirements related to preventing pollution or damage to the pipeline system from unneutralized acids.",

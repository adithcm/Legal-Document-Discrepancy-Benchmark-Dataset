                "original_text": "4.1 Quality Specifications. Transporter reserves the right to reject any and all shipments of: (i) Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper to Transporter whose gravity, viscosity, and/or other characteristics are such that it is not readily susceptible to transportation through the Transporter's existing facilities and it will damage the quality of other shipments or cause disadvantage to other shippers and/or the Transporter; (ii) Crude Petroleum containing water, sediment and other impurities totaling in excess of one per cent as determined by centrifugal test, or by such other tests as may be agreed upon by the Shipper and Transporter; or (iii) Crude Petroleum where Shipper has failed to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations made by any governmental authorities regarding shipment of Crude Petroleum.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Quality Specifications. Transporter may consider rejecting shipments of: (i) Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper to Transporter if the gravity, viscosity, and/or other characteristics are potentially not suitable for transportation through the Transporter's existing facilities and may affect the quality of other shipments or potentially disadvantage other shippers and/or the Transporter; (ii) Crude Petroleum containing water, sediment and other impurities potentially exceeding one per cent as determined by centrifugal test, or by such other tests as deemed reasonable by the Shipper and Transporter; or (iii) Crude Petroleum where Shipper has made an effort to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations made by any governmental authorities regarding shipment of Crude Petroleum.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the specifications by using vague language, such as 'may consider,' 'potentially not suitable,' 'may affect,' and 'potentially exceeding,' which reduces the binding nature of the requirements. It also uses 'deemed reasonable' for tests which could be open to interpretation. By replacing 'failed to comply' with 'made an effort to comply,' it creates ambiguity, as the law requires full compliance, not merely effort.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Natural Resources Code, which requires strict adherence to quality standards for crude petroleum transportation to prevent environmental damage and ensure fair market practices.",

                "changed_text": "5.2 Shipper, upon request by Transporter, will endeavor to install, maintain and operate, or try to make arrangements with platform owners to install, maintain, and operate equipment to inject corrosion inhibitors, biocides, scale inhibitors, paraffin chemicals, or other chemicals as may be specified by Transporter.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall' to 'will endeavor' and 'try to make arrangements' introduces ambiguity and reduces the obligation's enforceability. This weakens the requirement for Shipper to ensure the equipment's proper installation, maintenance, and operation, contradicting environmental regulations that mandate specific chemical injection systems for offshore oil operations.",

This Agreement is generally subject to, and the Parties should attempt to comply with, most valid present and future laws, regulations, rules and orders of Governmental Authorities believed to have some jurisdiction over the Parties, this Agreement, or the Services performed or the facilities utilized under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall comply' with 'should attempt to comply' and 'all valid' with 'most valid,' the legal obligation is weakened. The phrase 'believed to have some jurisdiction' adds uncertainty about which specific governmental authorities' laws apply. This change undermines the legally binding nature of compliance with applicable laws and regulations.",

                "original_text": "iVillage will deliver approximately [*] new advertising units each during the Promotion Period. For purposes of this Agreement, an advertising unit can include but shall not be limited to banners in the form of rich media, java-based, animated, daughter and/or pull-down banners, or a combination of appropriate technologies, and which shall represent and be defined by industry standards.",
                "changed_text": "iVillage will attempt to deliver approximately [*] new advertising units each during the Promotion Period. For purposes of this Agreement, an advertising unit may include banners in various forms, or other technologies at iVillage's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will deliver' to 'will attempt to deliver,' the obligation becomes less stringent and allows for non-delivery. The modification of 'can include but shall not be limited to' to 'may include' further loosens the definition of advertising units and giving iVillage total discretion, creating ambiguity about the actual deliverables. This contradicts general advertising standards that expect a defined commitment for deliverables.",

                "original_text": "During the Promotion Period, iVillage agrees to provide FMM with biweekly reports in connection with the promotional obligations set forth in this Agreement in addition to semi-annual executive reviews with iVillage management. All traffic reports shall be audited by the third party traffic auditor selected pursuant to Section 2.C.(ii). iVillage shall also provide, on a timely basis, impression tracking reports from a third party tracking system, confirming guaranteed impression delivery.",
                "changed_text": "During the Promotion Period, iVillage will endeavor to provide FMM with reports in connection with the promotional obligations set forth in this Agreement and may conduct executive reviews with iVillage management when feasible. Traffic reports may be subject to audit. iVillage will attempt to provide impression tracking reports.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligation to provide reports. Replacing 'agrees to provide' with 'will endeavor to provide' and 'shall be audited' with 'may be subject to audit' introduce uncertainty. Removing 'biweekly' and 'semi-annual' and 'on a timely basis' makes the reporting schedule unclear and impression delivery confirmations non-binding, creating ambiguity that undermines the purpose of reporting. This could violate basic contract law regarding the necessity of good faith reporting.",

                "explanation": "The original text says that iVillage agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts, while the altered text states that iVillage 'might consider actions it deems appropriate.' This makes the obligation vague and discretionary, which could be viewed as not meeting the requirement of mitigation of damages that could be construed as implicit in New York contract law.",

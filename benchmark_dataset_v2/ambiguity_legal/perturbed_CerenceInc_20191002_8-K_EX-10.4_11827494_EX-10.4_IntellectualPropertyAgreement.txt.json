                "original_text": "In order to carry out the intent of the Parties with respect to the recordation of the transfers of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, to the extent the ownership thereof has transferred from a member of the Nuance Group to a member of the SpinCo Group, or vice versa, pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, the Parties shall execute intellectual property assignments in a form substantially similar to that attached as Exhibit A1 (the \"Patent Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A2 (the \"Trademark Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A3 (the \"Domain Name Assignment Agreement\") and Exhibit A4 (the \"Invention Disclosure Assignment Agreement\") as well as such additional case specific assignments as deemed appropriate or necessary under applicable Laws (collectively, the \"Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements\") for recordation with the appropriate Governmental Authority.",
                "changed_text": "In order to carry out the intent of the Parties with respect to the recordation of the transfers of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP, as applicable, to the extent the ownership thereof has transferred from a member of the Nuance Group to a member of the SpinCo Group, or vice versa, pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, the Parties may execute intellectual property assignments in a form similar to that attached as Exhibit A1 (the \"Patent Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A2 (the \"Trademark Assignment Agreement\"), Exhibit A3 (the \"Domain Name Assignment Agreement\") and Exhibit A4 (the \"Invention Disclosure Assignment Agreement\") as well as additional case specific assignments as they consider suitable under applicable Laws (collectively, the \"Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements\") for recordation with the appropriate Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall execute' to 'may execute' and 'deemed appropriate or necessary' to 'they consider suitable' introduces ambiguity and makes the execution of assignments discretionary, rather than mandatory. This contradicts intellectual property law, which requires proper and timely recordation of IP transfers to ensure enforceability and avoid disputes.",

                "changed_text": "The relevant assignee Party should endeavor, at its own expense, to file the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreements and other relevant forms or documents with the appropriate Governmental Authorities as necessary to record the transfer of any registrations or applications of Nuance IP or SpinCo IP allocated under the Separation Agreement, as applicable; the assignor Party offers its consent to such recordation, if pursued.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall have the sole responsibility' with 'should endeavor,' the obligation to file IP assignment agreements becomes non-compulsory. The addition of 'if pursued' after the assignor's consent further weakens the obligation. This conflicts with the legal requirement to properly record IP transfers, which is essential for maintaining clear ownership and enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "Prior to, on, and after the Distribution Date, each Party will consider cooperating with the other Party, potentially without further consideration but at the expense of the requesting party, to facilitate the release of outstanding Security Interests attached to any Nuance IP or SpinCo IP subject to assignment hereunder, as applicable, and to evaluate the necessity of any actions requested by the other Party to achieve such release.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall cooperate' with 'will consider cooperating', 'at no expense' with 'at the expense of the requesting party', and 'all actions as the other Party may reasonably be requested' with 'necessity of any actions requested by the other Party' introduces ambiguity and reduces the mandatory nature of cooperation in releasing security interests on IP. This can conflict with requirements under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 9, regarding the release of security interests upon satisfaction of the underlying debt or obligation.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements to consummate, and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties should consider using reasonable efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take actions, and to do things, as they deem appropriate, under what they perceive as applicable Laws and agreements to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use reasonable best efforts' to 'should consider using reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation. Replacing 'reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws' with 'as they deem appropriate, under what they perceive as applicable Laws' makes compliance discretionary and subjective. This introduces ambiguity about the required actions and applicable laws.",

                "changed_text": "Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each Party may consider cooperating with the other Party, without any guarantee of further consideration, and potentially at the expense of the requesting Party: (i) to perhaps execute and deliver, or attempt to use efforts to execute and deliver, instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer if the Party feels it is reasonable to be requested by the other Party; (ii) to try to make filings with, and aim to obtain Consents of any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, Contract, indenture or other instrument; and (iii) to consider taking actions that the other Party may request from time to time, if deemed consistent with the overarching ideas of this Agreement, in order to generally align with the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and any transfers of Intellectual Property Rights or assignments and assumptions of Liabilities related thereto as broadly outlined in the Separation Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation to cooperate. Replacing 'shall cooperate' with 'may consider cooperating' and 'use reasonable best efforts' with 'attempt to use efforts' makes cooperation optional and weakens the standard of effort. Adding qualifiers like 'perhaps', 'if the Party feels', 'try to make', 'aim to obtain', 'if deemed consistent', and 'generally align' further reduces the certainty and enforceability of the cooperation requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring good faith and diligent performance, particularly the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, are undermined by the optional and vague language.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that it should generally consider applicable national and international laws and regulations relating to import and/or export control in its country(ies), if such laws are clearly relevant, regarding commodities, software, services or technology somewhat related to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'should generally consider' reduces the obligation to a mere consideration. Adding qualifiers like 'if such laws are clearly relevant' and 'somewhat related to this Agreement' introduces subjectivity and ambiguity about which laws and regulations are applicable, weakening the commitment to full compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Import and export control laws often require strict and mandatory compliance. The ambiguous language could lead to violations of these laws, such as the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which mandate specific compliance measures and do not allow for subjective interpretation.",

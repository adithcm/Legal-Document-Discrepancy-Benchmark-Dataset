                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Includes a 99 percent server uptime guarantee.",
                "changed_text": "Includes a server uptime guarantee that is generally expected to be around 99 percent.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces a clear '99 percent server uptime guarantee' with a vague statement that uptime is 'generally expected to be around 99 percent.' This introduces ambiguity, making the guarantee unenforceable and open to interpretation. It is unclear what recourse AstroNutrition.com would have if the uptime consistently fell below 99 percent, and what defines “generally expected”. This creates an ambiguous legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts Canadian consumer protection laws regarding misleading or deceptive business practices, as the guarantee is no longer clearly defined. Section 74.01 of the Competition Act (Canada) prohibits false or misleading representations.",
                "location": "Paragraph under 'Included Monthly Services'"

                "changed_text": "Reasonable efforts will be made to manage site source code and integrate contributed software updates and bug fixes into zencart.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'Management of site source code and integration… is included' with 'Reasonable efforts will be made,' the obligation becomes less stringent and more ambiguous. 'Reasonable efforts' is subjective and allows deep systems to avoid responsibility for properly managing the source code or integrating updates and bug fixes. This creates uncertainty about the level of service guaranteed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts Canadian contract law, which requires a certain level of diligence and performance in contractual obligations. The clause weakens the standard of care, leading to a possible breach of contract if deep systems fails to perform these tasks adequately. General principles of contract law require parties to act in good faith and with reasonable care. This modification introduces ambiguity that could undermine these principles.",

                "original_text": "Management of SMTP, IMAP, DNS, SQL database and HTTP server software and systems for the AstroNutrition.com domain and web site. This includes regular off-site backups of the website itself and the database.",
                "changed_text": "Management of SMTP, IMAP, DNS, SQL database and HTTP server software and systems for the AstroNutrition.com domain and web site. Efforts will be made to perform backups of the website and database.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'This includes regular off-site backups of the website itself and the database' with 'Efforts will be made to perform backups of the website and database' removes the explicit requirement for 'regular off-site backups,' creating ambiguity about the frequency, location, and method of backups. This weakens the obligation and puts AstroNutrition.com at risk if backups are not consistently performed or stored securely off-site.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts privacy regulations under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) if data is not backed up and secured adequately. Lack of regular off-site backups can lead to data loss, posing a risk to personal information and violating PIPEDA principles concerning data security. Additionally, under the British Columbia Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), organizations must have reasonable security arrangements in place to protect personal information, and this change weakens that requirement.",

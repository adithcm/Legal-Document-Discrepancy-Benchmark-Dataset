                "original_text": "(b) Ono shall ensure that each of its Sublicensees and distributors is bound by a written agreement between Ono and such Sublicensee or distributor that does not conflict with, and contains provisions as protective of the Products and Array, as this Agreement. Without limiting any of Ono's obligations under this Agreement, Ono shall also ensure that each Sublicensee expressly agrees in writing to be bound by all of Ono's obligations under this Agreement to the extent applicable to such Sublicensee, including without limitation, the following provisions of this Agreement (as if such Sublicensee were expressly named in each such provision, to the extent Ono's Sublicensees are not so named therein): Sections 2.6 (Grantback License to Array), 4.7 (Exchange of Data and Know-How); 4.8 (Right of Reference and Access to Data); 7.4 (Records), 8.2 (Exclusivity of Efforts) and 14.2 (transition obligations on termination).",
                "changed_text": "(b) Ono shall endeavor to ensure that each of its Sublicensees and distributors is bound by a written agreement between Ono and such Sublicensee or distributor that does not conflict with this Agreement. Ono shall also encourage each Sublicensee to agree in writing to be bound by Ono's obligations under this Agreement to the extent applicable. ",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligation for Ono to ensure its sublicensees and distributors are bound by agreements as protective as the original agreement, replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall endeavor to ensure' and 'encourage'. This introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation discretionary rather than mandatory. This is non-compliant with general contract law principles that enforce explicit obligations.",

In the event that Array proceeds with a Clinical Study in the Ono Territory without Ono's participation, then the Parties shall enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement pursuant to which Array shall provide Ono with the safety data.",

In the event that Array proceeds with a Clinical Study in the Ono Territory without Ono's participation, then the Parties will attempt to enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement pursuant to which Array will make an effort to provide Ono with the relevant safety data.",
                "explanation": "The modifications replace 'shall' with 'should consider' and 'will attempt' which introduces ambiguity and makes the obligations non-mandatory. The specific term 'relevant' is not defined in the contract, which leads to the introduction of a legal contradiction. This is non-compliant with pharmacovigilance regulations that require explicit safety data sharing agreements.",

                "changed_text": "(b) To the extent practical, Array agrees that neither it, nor any of its Affiliates, will try to avoid selling or providing the Product to any Third Party, if Array or its relevant Affiliate maybe thinks that Products sold or provided to such Third Party might be sold or transferred, in some way, for use in the Ono Territory.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing 'permitted under applicable Law' with 'To the extent practical'. It replace 'knows, or has reason to know' to 'maybe thinks' and 'directly or indirectly' to 'in some way'. This weakens the legal obligation, as it's now based on subjective reasoning and practical constraints, which may lead to non-compliance with regulations preventing the sale of products intended for restricted territories. The regulations require strict adherence, not practical effort.",

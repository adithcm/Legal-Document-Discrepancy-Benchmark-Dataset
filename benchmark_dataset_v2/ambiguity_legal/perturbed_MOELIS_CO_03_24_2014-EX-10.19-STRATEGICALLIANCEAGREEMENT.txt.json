                "original_text": "Each of the parties shall execute and perform this Agreement in compliance with all applicable laws or regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall not be obligated to take any action that violates, infringes or conflicts with or prohibited from taking any action required to be in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the parties shall attempt to execute and perform this Agreement in general accordance with applicable laws or regulations. A party shall not be strictly obligated to take any action that violates, infringes or conflicts with any applicable laws or regulations, but should endeavor to find alternative solutions where feasible.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall execute and perform in compliance' to 'shall attempt to execute and perform in general accordance' weakens the obligation. Adding that a party is not 'strictly obligated' introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intent of strict legal adherence. Including 'endeavor to find alternative solutions where feasible' creates a loophole where parties may not prioritize compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear and unambiguous obligations. This change creates room for interpretation and weakens the legally binding nature of compliance, making enforcement difficult under general contract law principles.",

The parties may enter into additional agreements and/or addenda to this Agreement designed to elaborate upon and clarify the arrangements contemplated by this Section 3.6.",
                "changed_text": "SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings may explore, at their discretion, opportunities to potentially expand the Strategic Alliance to incorporate corporate lending possibilities. Should Moelis Holdings identify potential corporate lending avenues for SMBC/Nikko pertaining to Moelis Holdings' clientele, and subsequently collaborate with SMBC/Nikko to facilitate SMBC/Nikko's clientele and network's utilization of Moelis Holdings' proficiency within pertinent Covered Businesses, the parties might consider supplementary agreements and/or addenda to this Agreement crafted to expound upon and explicate the arrangements envisioned within this Section 3.6.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a commitment to actively seek expansion. By changing 'will continue to work together in good faith to seek ways to expand' to 'may explore, at their discretion, opportunities to potentially expand,' the obligation becomes optional. Changing 'where Moelis Holdings sources corporate lending opportunities' to 'should Moelis Holdings identify potential corporate lending avenues' makes the sourcing of opportunities contingent and not required. This introduces ambiguity as to the level of effort required from each party and what constitutes 'exploring' opportunities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear and unambiguous obligations. By using vague language, the obligation to seek expansion becomes discretionary, conflicting with the intent of a strategic alliance, particularly partnership and good faith.",

                "original_text": "If the indemnification provided for in this Section 13.9 from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or is insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this Section 13.9, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) but also the relative benefit of Moelis Holdings, on the one hand, and each SMBC Unit-Holder, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that in no event shall a SMBC Unit-Holder be required by this Section 13.9(d) to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other selling expenses) received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution.",
                "changed_text": "If the indemnification provided for in this Section 13.9 from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or is deemed insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this Section 13.9, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, may consider contributing to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (i) in a proportion vaguely reflecting the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions that resulted in such Losses, taking into account various equitable factors, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is somehow not fully consistent with applicable law, in a proportion reflecting the vague relationship of the fault referred to in clause (i) and the nebulous benefits of Moelis Holdings, on the one hand, and each SMBC Unit-Holder, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as other undefined equitable considerations; provided, however, that there is no guarantee that a SMBC Unit-Holder will contribute if the aggregate amount were to exceed some dollar amount of proceeds.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will contribute' to 'may consider contributing,' the obligation to contribute becomes discretionary. Phrases like 'vaguely reflecting' and 'nebulous benefits' introduce ambiguity in how relative fault and benefits are assessed, making the contribution calculation subjective. Adding 'there is no guarantee that a SMBC Unit-Holder will contribute' weakens the commitment to contribute. This change could conflict with securities laws requiring clear financial responsibilities in registration statements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933, Section 11(f), regarding contribution among parties liable for false registration statements. The changes introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation to contribute, potentially conflicting with the requirement for a clear allocation of liability.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Beginning on the date on which deliveries of natural gas are                   commenced hereunder, and thereafter for the remaining term of                   this Agreement, Shipper agrees to tender gas to Transporter at                   the Point(s) of Receipt, and Transporter agrees to transport                   and redeliver and Shipper agrees to accept delivery of the                   Equivalent Quantities of gas at the Point(s) of Delivery, all     &bbsp;             in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Beginning on the date on which deliveries of natural gas are commenced hereunder, and thereafter for the remaining term of this Agreement, Shipper should endeavor to tender gas to Transporter at the Point(s) of Receipt, and Transporter will attempt to transport and redeliver and Shipper agrees to consider accepting delivery of the Equivalent Quantities of gas at the Point(s) of Delivery, all in general accordance with the spirit of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for the Shipper and Transporter. The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'agrees to' with 'should endeavor to', 'will attempt to', and 'agrees to consider accepting,' making performance discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'in general accordance with the spirit of this Agreement' further dilutes the obligation, introducing subjectivity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Arkansas contract law requires clear and definite terms for a contract to be enforceable. This modification introduces ambiguity, potentially rendering the obligation unenforceable under Arkansas law.",

Such FTS/ITS Rate Schedule and General Terms and                   Conditions are incorporated by reference and made a part                   hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Shipper will likely pay Transporter for the service hereunder an amount generally aligned with Transporter's FTS/ITS Rate Schedule, and vaguely consistent with the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, all as potentially revised from time to time. Such FTS/ITS Rate Schedule and General Terms and Conditions are referenced and considered a loose guide.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall pay' with 'will likely pay', 'determined in accordance with' with 'generally aligned with', 'consistent with' and 'are incorporated by reference and made a part hereof' with 'referenced and considered a loose guide', the obligation to pay according to the specific rate schedule is weakened. The ambiguity makes it unclear what payment is actually required.",
                "contradicted_law": "FERC regulations require transparency and adherence to filed tariffs. This modification introduces ambiguity regarding the applicable rate, potentially violating FERC requirements for clear and predictable pricing.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'shall execute and deliver' and 'shall do all acts necessary' have been changed to 'should aim to execute and deliver' and 'should attempt to do acts that may be useful'. By changing the wording, there is no longer an obligation to ensure the contract is followed, creating ambiguity and non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Arkansas contract law mandates that parties act in good faith to fulfill their contractual obligations. This clause weakens the obligation and violates that duty of good faith.",

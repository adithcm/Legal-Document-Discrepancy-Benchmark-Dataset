                "original_text": "Prior to first commercial sale of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) as the case may be in any particular country, Company shall establish and maintain, in each country in which Company shall sell LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), product liability or other appropriate insurance coverage appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained.",
                "changed_text": "Prior to first commercial sale of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) as the case may be in any particular country, Company should attempt to establish and maintain, in each country in which Company shall sell LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), product liability or other insurance coverage as it deems appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will endeavor to present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should attempt to' and 'will' to 'will endeavor to' weakens the obligation to establish and maintain appropriate insurance coverage and to provide evidence of this to JHU, making it discretionary instead of mandatory. Also the term 'as it deems appropriate' is open to interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of product liability law in Maryland and most jurisdictions require businesses to maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect against potential liabilities from product defects or services rendered. This change might not violate a specific statute, but it could undermine the principle of ensuring adequate financial protection for potential victims of harm caused by the licensed products or services, increasing legal risks.",

Such books and records shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.",
                "changed_text": "The Company should keep for what it considers a reasonable amount of time records, files and books of account possibly containing data for the computation of sales and other information required in Paragraph 4.4. Such books and records should generally align with accounting principles.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall make and retain for a period of three years' with 'should keep for what it considers a reasonable amount of time' it is vague and discretionary for how long records should be kept. Also changing 'containing all the data reasonably required' to 'possibly containing data' and 'shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied' to 'should generally align with accounting principles' weakens the legal requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "This undermines the intent of maintaining auditable financial records, which is crucial for compliance with tax laws and for verifying royalty payments, violating the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code.",

                "original_text": "Company shall pay to JHU, a running royalty as set forth in Exhibit A, for each LICENSED PRODUCT(S) sold and each LICENSED SERVICE(S) provided, based upon NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES respectively, for the term of this Agreement. Such payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter following first commercial sale of LICENSED PRODUCT or providing LICENSED SERVICES.",
                "changed_text": "Company will make reasonable efforts to pay to JHU, a running royalty as generally outlined in Exhibit A, for LICENSED PRODUCT(S) sold and LICENSED SERVICE(S) provided, broadly based upon NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES for the active term of this Agreement. Such payments will be made at some point after the end of each quarter following first commercial sale of LICENSED PRODUCT or providing LICENSED SERVICES.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall pay' to 'will make reasonable efforts to pay' weakens the payment obligation. Changing 'as set forth in Exhibit A' to 'as generally outlined in Exhibit A' weakens the definition of the royalty percentage. Removing 'respectively' also makes it ambiguous on how NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES are to be calculated. Finally, weakening the payment deadline of 'within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter' to 'at some point after the end of each quarter'.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change introduces significant ambiguity regarding the timeliness and completeness of royalty payments, undermining the financial terms of the agreement, thus potentially violating the Maryland Contract Law, which requires definiteness in the terms of a contract.",

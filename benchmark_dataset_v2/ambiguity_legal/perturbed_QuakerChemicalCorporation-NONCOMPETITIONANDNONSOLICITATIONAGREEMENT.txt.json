If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.",
                "changed_text": "(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller should endeavor to cause its Affiliates to hold, and may use what it considers appropriate efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller believes that such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public through actions not directly caused by the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is acquired by such Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not explicitly prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller subjectively determines is legally required to be disclosed, with efforts made depending on available resources to obtain a protective order or other assurance.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce ambiguity and weaken the obligation to maintain confidentiality. Replacing 'shall' with 'should endeavor,' 'reasonable best efforts' with 'what it considers appropriate efforts,' and 'can show' with 'believes that' introduces subjectivity. Additionally, changing 'not prohibited' to 'not explicitly prohibited' raises the bar for what constitutes a breach. Finally, replacing 'shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order' with 'with efforts made depending on available resources to obtain a protective order' weakens the legal obligation.",

Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it will generally not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which directly and substantially competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is materially engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) suggest any Seller, directly or indirectly, should be restricted from owning, as a passive investor, a small percentage of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) suggest any Seller, directly or indirectly, should be restricted from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and potential extensions thereof, which might include transactions with any entity, and (iii) restrict any business of which a Seller acquires some influence after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive a small amount of its aggregate net sales from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller acknowledges this covenant's reasonableness. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"influence\" means having some say in the direction of the management and policies of a Person.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the non-compete clause through vague and subjective language. Replacing 'shall not' with 'will generally not' makes the prohibition less absolute. Adding 'directly and substantially' and 'materially engaged' introduces ambiguity about what constitutes competition. Using 'small percentage', 'potential extensions', 'might include transactions' and 'some influence', are vague and open to interpretation, making enforcement difficult. By moving the covenant's reasonableness to be acknowledged, and not agreed upon, also weakens it.",

                "original_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former 3 employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Each Seller should consider refraining, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), from, where practical: (i) unduly influencing any employee of the Combined Business to consider terminating his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) actively targeting the employment of specific employees of the Combined Business. Sellers will not be strictly limited from (1) contacting for employment or potentially hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) reasonably prior to any contact by such Seller or (2) generally making public announcements about employment opportunities that happen to reach employees of the Combined Business; however, actual hiring decisions are at the Seller's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the non-solicitation agreement. Changing 'shall not' to 'should consider refraining, where practical' makes compliance discretionary. Using terms like 'unduly influencing' and 'actively targeting' are vague and subjective, rendering them difficult to enforce. Replacing 'at least six months' with 'reasonably prior' removes a clear timeline. The added phrase 'actual hiring decisions are at the Seller's discretion' further erodes the restriction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law regarding non-solicitation agreements requires them to be narrowly tailored and reasonable to protect legitimate business interests. The ambiguity introduced makes it easier for a court to find the agreement unenforceable and overbroad.",

If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.",
                "changed_text": "(a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller should, and should encourage its Affiliates to, hold, and should use its good faith efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller believes that such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no direct action of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is acquired by such Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not explicitly prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller will endeavor to notify Buyer in writing and will disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller subjectively determines is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller may attempt to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the seller to maintain confidentiality, using the term 'shall' and 'reasonable best efforts'. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'should', 'good faith efforts', 'believes that' and 'explicitly prohibited' which introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce the confidentiality provisions. Replacing 'shall promptly notify Buyer' with 'will endeavor to notify Buyer' diminishes the mandatory nature of the notification. The change also replaces 'is advised by its counsel is legally required' with 'subjectively determines', further reducing the legal obligation. The protective order is not guaranteed to be attempted.",

Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Each Seller should endeavor that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it will try not to, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which significantly competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a substantial shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, less than ten (10%) percent of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in substantially similar business as conducted on the Effective Date and arguable extensions thereof, which may include somewhat similar transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller gains influence after the Effective Date if the acquired business did not largely depend on product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller generally agrees that this covenant is reasonably acceptable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common influence with\") vaguely means the indirect possibility to subtly influence the management and policies of a Person, whether through the suggestion of voting securities, by obscure agreement or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'agrees that it shall not' with 'should endeavor that' and 'will try not to' weakens the commitment to the non-compete clause. The addition of 'significantly competes', 'substantial shareholder', 'reasonably acceptable', 'gains influence', 'subtly influence' introduces vagueness into the definition of prohibited activities. Increasing the passive investment threshold to less than 10% further weakens the non-compete clause. The added vagueness and qualifiers make the restrictions on the seller's activities ambiguous and difficult to legally enforce.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Each Seller may endeavor that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller should try not to, directly or indirectly: (i) generally encourage any employee of the Combined Business to consider other employment, or (ii) casually mention employment opportunities to any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers may be permitted from (1) suggesting employment to former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was somehow terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) sometime prior to such solicitation by such Seller or (2) vaguely mentioning employment opportunities of the Combined Business through a generalized posting or standard communication that may or may not target at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall maybe permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "explanation": "The original section clearly prohibits the solicitation of employees. The modified text uses permissive and vague language such as 'may endeavor', 'should try not to', 'generally encourage', 'casually mention', 'somehow terminated', and 'sometime prior'. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the non-solicitation agreement. Using 'vaguely mentioning employment opportunities' is ambiguous, the 'maybe permit' creates further ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall cooperate and use its reasonable efforts in making all notifications to, and seeking all consents of, Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. No Party shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the filing or receipt of such necessary or advisable notifications or consents.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may cooperate and use its good faith efforts in considering making notifications to, and exploring seeking consents of, Governmental Authorities that it subjectively deems necessary or advisable to potentially facilitate the transactions contemplated hereby within a timeframe it finds convenient. No Party shall intentionally take actions that are definitively proven to directly prevent the filing or receipt of notifications or consents.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'shall cooperate and use its reasonable efforts' with 'may cooperate and use its good faith efforts,' making cooperation optional and less rigorous. The subjective qualification of 'subjectively deems' introduces ambiguity, and the relaxed timeline of 'within a timeframe it finds convenient' makes compliance less certain. By saying that Parties will not 'intentionally take actions that are definitively proven to directly prevent the filing or receipt of notifications or consents,' this means the parties can still interfere with the receipt of notifications and consents as long as they claim that they weren't doing it 'intentionally.'",

SPI will also aim to possibly consider the matter of incentives within a timeframe it deems reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original obligation is weakened by adding numerous qualifiers that render it unenforceable. 'Endeavor, to the extent reasonably practicable and subject to internal policy considerations' makes providing incentives discretionary. 'May be generally comparable, subject to subjective interpretation' introduces ambiguity about the standards for comparison. The addition of 'hypothetically available to such employees' further muddles the situation by indicating that this does not need to follow the incentives made available to employees of Acquiror",

                "explanation": "This change makes the limitation of liability entirely discretionary by using 'will be potentially subject to limitations' and 'which may or may not be invoked at the Indemnifying Party's sole discretion.' The vague criteria ('then-current financial situation, market conditions, and other subjective factors it deems relevant') and the individual assessment ('shall be determined on a case-by-case basis') introduce significant ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce any indemnification obligations.",

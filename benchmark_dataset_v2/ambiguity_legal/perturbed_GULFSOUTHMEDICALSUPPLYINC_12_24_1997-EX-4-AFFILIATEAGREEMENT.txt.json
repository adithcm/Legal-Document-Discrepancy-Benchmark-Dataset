                "changed_text": "PSS will endeavor, for a period of three years after the effective date of the Merger, to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as it deems reasonably practicable, so that public information may potentially be available to the undersigned should they consider transferring shares of PSS Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'agrees...to file on a timely basis all reports required' with 'will endeavor...to file reports...as it deems reasonably practicable,' making the obligation to file reports discretionary and weakening the commitment to timely filing. This introduces ambiguity and reduces the certainty of compliance with SEC regulations.",

                "original_text": "If the undersigned desires to sell or otherwise transfer the shares of PSS Common Stock received by him in connection with the Merger at any time during the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d), the undersigned will provide the necessary representation letter to the transfer agent for PSS Common Stock together with such additional information as the transfer agent may reasonably request.  If PSS's counsel concludes that such proposed sale or transfer complies with the requirements of Rule 145(d), PSS shall cause such counsel to provide such opinions as may be necessary to PSS's Transfer Agent so that the undersigned may complete the proposed sale or transfer.",
                "changed_text": "If the undersigned considers selling or transferring shares of PSS Common Stock received in connection with the Merger, the undersigned may provide a representation letter to the transfer agent. PSS's counsel may, if they find it appropriate, provide opinions that they deem necessary to PSS's Transfer Agent to potentially facilitate the proposed sale or transfer.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly outlines the steps to be taken for transferring shares under Rule 145(d). The revised text introduces ambiguity by using 'may' instead of 'will' for the shareholder's actions and by making the counsel's provision of opinions discretionary ('may, if they find it appropriate') rather than obligatory. This weakens the process and does not guarantee the shareholder the necessary support to complete a transfer under Rule 145(d).",

                "original_text": "The undersigned recognizes and agrees that the foregoing provisions also apply to all shares of the capital stock of GSMS and PSS that are deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws, which the undersigned agrees may include, without limitation, shares owned or held in the name of (i) the undersigned's spouse, (ii) any relative of the undersigned or of the undersigned's spouse who has the same home as the undersigned, (iii) any trust or estate in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse, and any such relative collectively own at least a 10% beneficial interest or of which any of the foregoing serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity, and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse and any such relative collectively own at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.  The undersigned further recognizes that, in the event that the undersigned is a director or officer of PSS or becomes a director or officer of PSS upon consummation of the Merger, among other things, any sale of PSS Common Stock by the undersigned within a period of less than six months following the effective time of the Merger may subject the undersigned to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledges that the preceding provisions might apply to shares of GSMS and PSS stock beneficially owned under federal securities laws, potentially including shares held by (i) the undersigned's spouse, (ii) relatives sharing the same home, (iii) trusts where the family has some interest, and (iv) organizations where the family has some ownership. Furthermore, if the undersigned is or becomes an officer or director of PSS, stock sales within six months of the Merger could conceivably lead to liabilities under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'recognizes and agrees that the foregoing provisions also apply to' into 'acknowledges that the preceding provisions might apply to', the obligation becomes uncertain. Using 'potentially including' instead of a definitive list of related parties weakens the scope of beneficial ownership. The use of 'could conceivably lead to' instead of 'may subject the undersigned to liability' reduces the certainty of legal consequences related to Section 16(b). This creates ambiguity about the extent of the affiliate's responsibilities and liabilities.",

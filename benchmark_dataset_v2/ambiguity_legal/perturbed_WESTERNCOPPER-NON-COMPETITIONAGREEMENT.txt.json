                "original_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever,\n\n(a) carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or\n\n(b) advise, lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name to\nbe used by any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities,\n\nin the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "changed_text": "Western Copper will endeavor to avoid direct competition with Glamis for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date. With reasonable effort, it will attempt not to, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person,\n\n(a) substantially engage in Mining Activities, or\n\n(b) potentially advise or support any Person who seems to engage in Mining Activities,\n\nin the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the non-compete clause. Replacing 'covenants and agrees' with 'will endeavor to avoid' makes the obligation less strict. Introducing 'reasonable effort' and 'substantially engage' adds ambiguity, making enforcement difficult. The term 'potentially advise or support any Person who seems to engage in Mining Activities' adds another layer of vagueness. This may contradict standard interpretations of non-compete agreements under British Columbia law, which often require clarity and specificity in defining prohibited activities.",

                "original_text": "Glamis covenants and agrees with Western Copper that if at any time it intends to dispose of a Designated Mineral Property for cash consideration or by abandonment, it will give  Western Copper notice (the ' Disposition Notice\") of the intended disposition. For a period of  30 days from the time of delivery of the Disposition Notice Glamis will, if requested by Western  Silver, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. In  the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash  consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for  the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property. If Glamis and Western Copper  are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property  within the 30 day period, Glamis may thereafter dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it  sees til in its absolute discretion. If Glamis does not dispose of the Designated Mineral Property  within a period of 3 months from the first to occur of the date that Glamis and Western Copper  acknowledge failure to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral  Property and the end of the 30 day period, the provisions of this section 2.2 will once again apply  to any intended disposition of the Designated Mineral Property by Glamis. In the case of a  Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to abandon, Glamis wall, if requested by  Western Copper, transfer such Designated Mineral Property to Western Copper at no cost save  and except for the reasonable costs of transfer incurred by Glamis.",
                "changed_text": "Glamis will attempt to provide Western Copper with notice if it considers disposing of a Designated Mineral Property. For approximately 30 days after delivering said notice, Glamis may consider an offer from Western Copper. In the case of a sale for cash, the parties might attempt to negotiate an agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, Glamis can dispose of the property as it sees fit. If Glamis does not dispose of the property within roughly 3 months, this section 2.2 may or may not reapply to future potential dispositions. In the case of abandonment, Glamis may consider transferring the property to Western Copper, potentially covering reasonable transfer costs.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a 'Right of First Offer.' The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing definitive terms like 'covenants and agrees,' 'will give notice,' and 'will negotiate in good faith' with weaker, less binding language such as 'will attempt to provide,' 'may consider,' 'might attempt,' and 'can dispose.' Quantifiable time periods ('30 days,' '3 months') are replaced with vague approximations ('approximately 30 days', 'roughly 3 months'). The use of 'may or may not reapply' introduces uncertainty regarding the reapplication of the clause, and adding the uncertainty with Glamis 'potentially covering reasonable transfer costs'. These changes significantly weaken Western Copper's right of first offer, creating non-compliance regarding clear contractual requirements. This contradicts the contract law of British Columbia that requires the original clarity for agreements to be deemed legally binding.",

                "explanation": "The original clause enforces that both parties are restricted to the agreement and ensures that restrictions are fully and strictly followed. The new clause introduces uncertainty in how to ensure that all restrictions within the agreement are followed. The text now introduces ambiguity in how valid the restrictions are and defenses to said validity. This weakens the mutual waiver of defenses, potentially undermining the enforceability of the agreement's restrictions. The clause makes the statement of belief rather than in full certainty of what the original text stated. This new clause makes the entire agreement vague on a mutual decision, directly conflicting with the 'Contract Law of British Columbia regarding the enforceability of mutual agreements'.",

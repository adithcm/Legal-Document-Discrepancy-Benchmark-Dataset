                "original_text": "Company will at all times comply with the technical and customer service requirements and Site standards (including, without limitation, user privacy policies and customer guarantees) to be agreed upon by the Parties within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date and attached hereto as Exhibit B.",
                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to comply with the technical and customer service requirements and Site standards (including, without limitation, user privacy policies and customer guarantees) as the Parties find practical within a reasonable timeframe after the Effective Date and attached hereto as Exhibit B.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Company 'will at all times comply,' creating a definitive obligation. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing 'will at all times comply' to 'will endeavor to comply,' making compliance subject to effort rather than a guarantee. Additionally, replacing 'forty-five (45) days' with 'a reasonable timeframe' introduces vagueness regarding the deadline, creating ambiguity about when compliance is actually required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, requires clear and definite standards for ensuring customer service and privacy. By making compliance discretionary and the timeframe vague, the modification introduces uncertainty that could lead to inconsistent application of user privacy policies and customer guarantees, violating the FTC Act.",

                "changed_text": "Company will attempt to comply, and will try to ensure that the Mirror Company Site, the Spoken-Word Audio Products and all other activities undertaken through or in connection with the Mirror Company Site and this Agreement (including, without limitation, the participation of ACSI and its Affiliates as contemplated by this Agreement) are generally compliant with what they understand to be applicable Laws.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Company 'will comply,' a clear legal obligation. The modified text uses 'will attempt to comply' and 'try to ensure' which are ambiguous and weaken the obligation. The phrase 'generally compliant with what they understand to be applicable Laws' introduces further ambiguity, as it makes compliance dependent on the Company's interpretation and effort, rather than strict adherence to all applicable laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to maintain accurate and reliable financial reporting and internal controls. By weakening the compliance language, the modification could allow the Company to justify non-compliance based on their 'understanding' or 'attempt,' thus undermining the stringent compliance standards required for financial accuracy and transparency under SOX.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party will consider protecting the Confidential Information of the other Party from obvious misappropriation and gross unauthorized use or disclosure, and will endeavor to take precautions similar to those they find feasible to protect its own confidential information, provided such effort is commercially reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear minimum standard of care for protecting confidential information. The revised text introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'protect' with 'consider protecting' weakens the obligation. Adding 'obvious misappropriation' and 'gross unauthorized use' narrows the scope of what's protected. The phrase 'endeavor to take precautions similar to those they find feasible' makes the protective measures discretionary. Finally, requiring the effort to be 'commercially reasonable' introduces a subjective assessment that could justify inadequate protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "This potentially violates the Economic Espionage Act (EEA), which criminalizes the theft of trade secrets. By weakening the protection of confidential information and making it subject to feasibility and commercial reasonableness, the modified clause may not meet the standard of care required to prevent trade secret theft, thus conflicting with the EEA.",

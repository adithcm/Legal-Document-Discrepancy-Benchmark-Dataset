                "original_text": "Company will at all times comply with the technical and customer service requirements and Site standards (including, without limitation, user privacy policies and customer guarantees) to be agreed upon by the Parties within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date and attached hereto as Exhibit B.",
                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to comply with the technical and customer service requirements and Site standards (including, without limitation, user privacy policies and customer guarantees) to be generally agreed upon by the Parties sometime after the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'at all times comply' with 'endeavor to comply,' weakening the obligation. The phrase 'generally agreed upon' makes the agreement on requirements less definitive, and removing the 45-day deadline makes compliance open to interpretation, and there should be an exhibit B. This weakens the obligation to follow customer service requirements in the state of Washington.",
                "contradicted_law": "Washington Consumer Protection Act (WCPA) - Requires businesses to maintain certain standards of fair practice and customer service. By weakening the compliance obligation, it can create a legal dispute on whether the company is complying with the CPA.",

                "changed_text": "Company will make reasonable efforts to collect and pay, and attempt to indemnify ACSI and its Affiliates from, most sales, use, excise, import or export, value added or similar tax or duty not based on ACSI's or its Affiliates' net income. These efforts include penalties and interest, and the costs associated with said collection and withholding, but not necessarily attorneys fees in connection therewith, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or Company's advertisement, offer or sale of any products.",
                "explanation": "By changing the terminology, the clause transforms the obligations of the company to be more obscure. Changing 'collect and pay' to 'make reasonable efforts to collect and pay,' and the exclusion of 'attorneys fees' in the obligations when it comes to sales tax could violate Washington state tax compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Washington State sales and use tax laws - Require businesses to collect and remit sales tax on taxable sales. Failure to do so can result in penalties and interest.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'will protect' with 'will endeavor to protect' and removing the 'reasonable care' clause, the obligation is weakened and becomes subjective. This may not meet the standards of trade secret protection under Washington's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) if deemed inadequate.",
                "contradicted_law": "Washington Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) - Requires reasonable measures to protect trade secrets. The amended clause introduces ambiguity regarding what constitutes adequate protection.",

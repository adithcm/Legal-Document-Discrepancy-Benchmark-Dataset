                "original_text": "Agent, as the exclusive agent for Merchant, is authorized to conduct, advertise, post signs, utilize sign-walkers, and otherwise promote the GOB Sale as a \"going out of business\", \"store closing\", \"sale on everything\", \"everything must go\", or similar themed sale, in accordance with the Sale Guidelines (as the same may be modified and approved by the Bankruptcy Court), subject to compliance with the Sale Guidelines, the Approval Order, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including, without limitation, all laws and regulations relating to advertising, privacy, consumer protection, occupational health and safety and the environment, together with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of, and applicable restrictions imposed by, governmental authorities (collectively, the \"Applicable General Laws\"), other than all applicable laws, rules and regulations in respect of \"going out of business\", \"store closing\" or similar-themed sales and permitting (collectively, the \"Liquidation Sale Laws\");",
                "changed_text": "Agent, as the exclusive agent for Merchant, is generally authorized to conduct, advertise, post signs, utilize sign-walkers, and otherwise promote the GOB Sale as a \"going out of business\", \"store closing\", \"sale on everything\", \"everything must go\", or similar themed sale, with consideration given to the Sale Guidelines (as the same may be modified and approved by the Bankruptcy Court). Compliance with the Sale Guidelines, the Approval Order, and applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances will be reasonably pursued. This includes, in general, all laws and regulations relating to advertising, privacy, consumer protection, occupational health and safety and the environment, together with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of, and restrictions imposed by, governmental authorities (collectively, the \"Applicable General Laws\"), other than laws, rules and regulations regarding \"going out of business\", \"store closing\" sales and permitting (the \"Liquidation Sale Laws\");",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'generally authorized,' 'consideration given to,' and 'reasonably pursued' weaken the obligations, making compliance discretionary and subject to interpretation. This creates ambiguity around the extent to which the Agent must adhere to the Sale Guidelines and applicable laws. The original text mandates strict adherence ('is authorized... subject to compliance'), while the revised text suggests a more flexible approach ('generally authorized... with consideration given to').",
                "contradicted_law": "15 U.S. Code ยง 41 - Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), and state-level consumer protection laws, which demand clear and truthful advertising and do not allow for vaguely 'reasonably pursued' compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Merchant should endeavor to prepare and file necessary reports and documents as requested by taxing authorities, and Merchant will attempt to pay Sales Taxes from the Sales Taxes Account when feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall prepare and file' to 'should endeavor to prepare and file' and 'shall promptly pay' to 'will attempt to pay... when feasible' weakens the obligation to comply with tax laws. This ambiguity undermines the strict requirements for sales tax remittance.",

                "changed_text": "Agent may maintain, at Agent's cost (as an Expense) and in amounts Agent considers reasonable, commercial general liability policies. Agent will attempt to include Merchant as an additional insured.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall maintain' with 'may maintain' makes insurance coverage optional, and the attempt to include merchant as an insured may not happen. The lack of a clear obligation to maintain insurance coverage and include the merchant as an additional insured creates ambiguity and reduces liability protection.",

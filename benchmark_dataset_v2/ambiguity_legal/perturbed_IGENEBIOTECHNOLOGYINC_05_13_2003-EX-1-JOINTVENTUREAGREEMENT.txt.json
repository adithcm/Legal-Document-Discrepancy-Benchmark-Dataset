                "original_text": "Each of the Parties hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or proper under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, obtaining consent under the HSR Act (if necessary) and any other relevant governmental consents. The Parties shall share the cost of any filings required under this Article 2.3 equally.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties will endeavor to take actions to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking consent under the HSR Act if they deem it strictly necessary and any other relevant governmental consents as they see fit. The Parties will consider sharing the cost of any filings required under this Article 2.3 equitably.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will endeavor to take actions,' which weakens the commitment. 'If necessary' is changed to 'if they deem it strictly necessary' making the consent discretionary. 'Shall share the cost' is replaced with 'will consider sharing the cost equitably' which introduces further ambiguity and makes cost-sharing non-mandatory. This contradicts the **Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976**, which mandates certain filings and approvals for mergers and acquisitions that meet specific thresholds. The ambiguous language could lead to non-compliance if a party decides not to file or pay their share of the filing costs, delaying or obstructing the merger process.",

                "original_text": "It is the intention of the Parties that any debt incurred by the Joint Venture shall be non-recourse against each Party. Each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Venture to incur long-term indebtedness in an amount that is consistent with the business and cash desires of the Parties and the cash needs of the Joint Venture; provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to contribute any additional capital or guarantee, directly or indirectly, any debt of the Joint Venture including without limitation any leases or other direct or indirect obligations.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties generally intend that any debt incurred by the Joint Venture should ideally be non-recourse against each Party. Each of the Parties may consider influencing the Joint Venture to incur some long-term indebtedness, vaguely aligned with the business and cash desires of the Parties and the approximate cash needs of the Joint Venture; provided, however, that neither Party should feel absolutely compelled to contribute any additional capital or guarantee, directly or indirectly, any debt of the Joint Venture including without limitation any leases or other direct or indirect obligations.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the obligation regarding non-recourse debt and efforts to incur long-term indebtedness vague and discretionary. 'It is the intention' is weakened to 'The Parties generally intend that any debt incurred by the Joint Venture should ideally be non-recourse'. 'Agrees to use its reasonable best efforts' is replaced with 'may consider influencing' and 'vaguely aligned with the business and cash desires'. 'Shall be required' is diluted to 'should feel absolutely compelled.' This introduces significant uncertainty. The ambiguity could violate standard **financial and contractual law** principles that require clear and enforceable debt obligations. Creditors rely on clear terms when extending credit, and this clause weakens the assurance of repayment, opening the debt obligation to dispute and potentially breaching lending agreements.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall produce and submit to the Board, as promptly as possible, a reasonable estimate of their respective income tax liability with respect to the income of the Operating Company computed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph as by a reasonably prudent taxpayer attempting to reduce the income tax payable by such taxpayer to the greatest extent permitted by law (a \"Party Tax Estimate\"). A Party Tax Estimate shall be calculated pursuant to United States and/or United Kingdom law and regulations (and the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction under which the earnings of the Operating Company may be taxable to either Party) as may be applicable to either Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may try to produce and submit to the Board, when convenient, a rough estimate of their respective potential income tax exposure related to the income of the Operating Company, perhaps loosely following some of the provisions of this paragraph and generally considering principles of tax minimization (a \"Party Tax Consideration\"). A Party Tax Consideration might be generally informed by United States and/or United Kingdom law and regulations (and the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction under which the earnings of the Operating Company may be taxable to either Party) as possibly applicable to either Party.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall produce and submit' with 'may try to produce and submit, when convenient' making the obligation discretionary. 'Reasonable estimate' is changed to 'rough estimate', and 'Party Tax Estimate' to 'Party Tax Consideration', weakening the precision and formal nature. 'Might be generally informed by' replaces 'shall be calculated pursuant to', making the application of tax laws optional and vague. This contradicts **US tax law** and **UK tax law**, which require accurate and timely reporting of income and tax liabilities. The ambiguous language could lead to inaccurate tax filings and potential penalties.",

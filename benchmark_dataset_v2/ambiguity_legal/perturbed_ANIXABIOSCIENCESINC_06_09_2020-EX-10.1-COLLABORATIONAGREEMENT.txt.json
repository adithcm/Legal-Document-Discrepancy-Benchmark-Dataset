                "original_text": "Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to maintain records of activities performed under the Research Program and Inventions made. Such records should be generally appropriate. Each Party will consider providing the other Party with access to such records if deemed reasonable. Each Party may retain such records for a suitable period.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by changing 'will maintain complete and accurate records' to 'should endeavor to maintain records,' making the obligation discretionary. 'In sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes' is replaced with 'should be generally appropriate,' creating vagueness about the required quality of records. 'Will provide the other Party with the right to inspect' becomes 'will consider providing,' weakening the access obligation. 'At least three (3) years' is changed to 'a suitable period,' making the retention period unclear.",

Financial reimbursements claimed according to such indemnification shall not exceed payments received by OntoChem under this contract.",
                "changed_text": "OntoChem may consider indemnifying Anixa, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from liabilities arising from third-party claims related to OntoChem's actions under this Agreement. The extent of financial reimbursements, if any, will be subject to negotiation and mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'will indemnify, defend and hold harmless' with 'may consider indemnifying,' making the indemnification obligation optional. The removal of specific causes (breach, negligence, willful misconduct) introduces ambiguity about what triggers potential indemnification. 'Shall not exceed payments received' is replaced by 'subject to negotiation and mutual agreement,' creating uncertainty about the financial limits of indemnification.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding indemnification, which typically require clear and binding obligations for indemnification to be enforceable. The ambiguity weakens the legal protection Anixa should have, particularly concerning liability for third-party claims.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply' to 'should generally adhere' weakens the obligation to a mere suggestion. Adding 'perceived relevant' introduces subjectivity and ambiguity regarding which laws are applicable, potentially conflicting with mandatory legal requirements.",

                "original_text": "Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will attempt to maintain records of activities performed under the Research Program and Inventions made. Records should be detailed and in a generally scientific manner. Each Party will consider providing the other Party access to inspect such records if deemed appropriate, and may provide copies upon request if reasonably convenient. Each Party will try to retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation to maintain records. Replacing 'will maintain complete and accurate records' with 'will attempt to maintain records' introduces ambiguity and reduces accountability. The phrase 'should be detailed and in a generally scientific manner' provides no clear standard for compliance. The clause 'Each Party will consider providing the other Party access to inspect such records if deemed appropriate, and may provide copies upon request if reasonably convenient' weakens the original by making it conditional. The removal of 'such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation' eliminates a requirement that goes against regulations that mandate how long to retain a certain document based on governing law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal regulations like 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA regulations on electronic records and signatures) require complete, accurate, and readily available records for regulated industries. Also, Delaware law requires records to be accurate and updated regularly, the term 'attempt' does not conform.",

                "original_text": "OntoChem may engage one or more subcontractors to perform its activities under the Research Plan with the prior written approval of Anixa and provided that, with respect to any such subcontractor, OntoChem will (a) be responsible and liable for the performance of such subcontractor and (b) enter into a written agreement (i) consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property, and (ii) prohibiting such subcontractor from further subcontracting. For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be purchased are nor regarded as subcontractors.",
                "changed_text": "OntoChem may consider engaging subcontractors for activities under the Research Plan, pending a discussion with Anixa. OntoChem will endeavor to ensure the subcontractor performs reasonably, and will attempt to have a written agreement that generally aligns with this Agreement, including on confidentiality and intellectual property. Vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be purchased are not typically viewed as subcontractors.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'with the prior written approval of Anixa' with 'pending a discussion with Anixa,' making the approval process vague. Replacing 'OntoChem will be responsible and liable' with 'OntoChem will endeavor to ensure the subcontractor performs reasonably' weakens the liability clause. Changing 'enter into a written agreement' to 'attempt to have a written agreement' makes the agreement non-mandatory. By using 'generally aligns' the legal obligation becomes unclear, failing to ensure all the legal requirements are implemented.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles require clear agreement on terms, particularly in subcontracting arrangements. The modified text introduces uncertainty about Anixa's approval and the subcontractor's obligations, potentially violating these principles. Delaware law requires complete accuracy on all documented agreements.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party aims to ensure that Representatives who participate in activities under this Agreement are generally aware of confidentiality obligations and invention assignments. Each Party will make reasonable efforts to comply with relevant laws and regulations during its performance of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation replaces 'will be subject to written obligations' with 'are generally aware of confidentiality obligations,' thus weakening the legal enforceability to a non-binding standard. Substituting 'such Party will comply with applicable laws' with 'make reasonable efforts to comply' transforms a strict requirement into a non-binding duty, leaving room for interpretation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware law requires strict compliance with all aspects of agreements. Using the terms 'aims to ensure' and 'make reasonable efforts to comply' is vague and could lead to non-compliance, since the terms do not provide strict requirements.",

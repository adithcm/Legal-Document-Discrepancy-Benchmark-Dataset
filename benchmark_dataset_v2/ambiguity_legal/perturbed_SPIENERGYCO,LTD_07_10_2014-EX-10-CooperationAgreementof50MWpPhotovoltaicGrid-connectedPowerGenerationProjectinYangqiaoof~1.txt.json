                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Party B will endeavor to ensure that the land nature is not drastically changed for building the PV project; development will be considered in accordance with broad national guidelines; preference will be given to local employees; building materials may be sourced locally where feasible, and expenses will be addressed in a timely fashion.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the original obligations by replacing definitive statements with vague promises. 'Will endeavor to ensure' is less binding than 'promises,' 'broad national guidelines' lacks specificity, 'preference will be given' is weaker than 'will enjoy the priority,' 'may be sourced locally where feasible' introduces uncertainty, and 'expenses will be addressed in a timely fashion' is ambiguous compared to 'expenses will be paid on schedule.' This violates land use regulations and fair labor practices commonly enforced, making the agreement difficult to enforce under PRC law regarding land use and labor.",

                "changed_text": "Party A intends to support the project construction and development of Party B, and will aim to provide preferential policies and general service in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and may coordinate relevant departments and units to assist Party B's project construction progress.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'supports and guarantees' to 'intends to support', 'will provide the most preferential policies and all-round service' to 'will aim to provide preferential policies and general service' and 'actively coordinate' to 'may coordinate,' the legal obligation is significantly weakened. 'Intends', 'aim', and 'may' are non-committal. This contradicts the initial intention of supporting the project and makes it difficult to enforce specific performance should Party A fail to actively assist Party B. This can create non-compliance with regulatory requirements for project development permissions.",

                "changed_text": "Party B should consider registering a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County before implementing the project; Party A will consider offering relevant policies to the company in accordance with its discretion for foreign investment.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'will register' is replaced with 'should consider registering', thus making the act of registering a foreign-funded company optional, not mandatory. Additionally, 'Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction' has been altered to 'Party A will consider offering relevant policies to the company in accordance with its discretion for foreign investment'. The word choice of 'consider' for both parties and 'relevant policies' with 'discretion' makes the legal obligation vague and up to the interpretation of the involved parties. This creates difficulties when ensuring all project development regulations and fiscal levy are followed.",

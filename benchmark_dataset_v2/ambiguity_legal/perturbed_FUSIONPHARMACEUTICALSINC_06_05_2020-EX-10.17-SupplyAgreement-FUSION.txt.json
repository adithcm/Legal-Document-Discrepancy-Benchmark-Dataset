                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "CPDC shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any and all facility or other licenses, permits, registrations, and any regulatory approvals necessary to manufacture, handle, store, label, package and prepare under cGMP conditions Products for shipment, and the packaging, supply and export of Product to FUSION or its designees in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the Clinical Phase. This includes, but is not limited to, the use and handling of radioactive materials. For greater certainty CPDC will abide by all laws, rules and regulations as applicable for radiation safety by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (\"CNSC\") for compliance.",
                "changed_text": "CPDC shall endeavor to obtain and maintain facility licenses, permits, registrations, and regulatory approvals deemed reasonably necessary to manufacture, handle, store, label, package, and prepare Products for shipment under conditions it considers appropriate, and the packaging, supply and export of Product to FUSION or its designees in general accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the Clinical Phase. This includes, in a general sense, the use and handling of radioactive materials. CPDC will attempt to abide by laws, rules and regulations as applicable for radiation safety by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (\"CNSC\") for compliance.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation from 'shall be responsible' to 'shall endeavor,' making the responsibility for licenses and approvals less stringent. Replacing 'necessary' with 'deemed reasonably necessary' and 'cGMP conditions' with 'conditions it considers appropriate' introduces subjectivity, while replacing 'For greater certainty CPDC will abide' to 'CPDC will attempt to abide' weakens the obligation to follow applicable laws and regulation. The change of wording introduces ambiguity, making it difficult to enforce compliance with specific regulations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall pay' to 'shall use its best efforts to pay' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to pay invoices within the specified timeframe. The addition of 'in general accordance' further reduces the stringency of the payment terms. This creates an ambiguous payment obligation that is open to interpretation, potentially conflicting with standard contract law principles that require clear and unambiguous payment terms.",

All such records shall be maintained by CPDC according to that specified within the Quality Agreement. CPDC shall provide to FUSION reasonable access to such records upon request Prior to destruction of any record after such time, CPDC shall give written notice to FUSION.",
                "changed_text": "CPDC shall, to a reasonable extent, maintain records it believes are adequate to evidence compliance with (i) applicable cGMP regulations, Canadian Environmental Health and Safety (\"EHS\") regulations, the requirements of the CNSC, and Canadian and International regulations for the transport of dangerous goods as they generally relate to the supply and manufacture of Products; (ii) the Specifications; and (iii) obligations under this Agreement. Such records shall be maintained by CPDC as it deems appropriate. CPDC shall provide FUSION access to records as it sees fit and reasonable notice before record destruction when practical.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the record-keeping obligation by changing 'shall maintain all records necessary' to 'shall, to a reasonable extent, maintain records it believes are adequate.' Replacing 'in all respects' with 'as they generally relate' introduces ambiguity about the scope of compliance. Furthermore, replacing 'as it sees fit' weakens the requirements on which and how the records should be maintained. Replacing 'reasonable access' with 'access as it sees fit' gives CPDC discretion over providing records, while adding 'when practical' to the destruction notice makes the notification requirement non-mandatory. This alteration creates uncertainty around the obligation to maintain and provide accurate records, potentially conflicting with regulatory requirements for documentation.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Consultant shall keep all Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant shall not disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except to perform the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant shall endeavor to keep Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant should not disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except when deemed necessary to perform the Services.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'endeavor to keep' weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality, making it less strict and more subjective. Furthermore, 'when deemed necessary' introduces ambiguity, allowing the consultant to potentially disclose confidential information based on their own judgment, which could contradict trade secret laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA)",
                "location": "4(b)"

                "changed_text": "Consultant represents as follows: (c) Consultant will make reasonable efforts to perform the Services in accordance with Applicable Law;",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'will make reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation. Applicable Law often requires strict compliance, and 'reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity that could allow non-compliance. This is because some laws require strict compliance and not just 'reasonable efforts'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and California state laws depending on the specific services being provided (e.g., healthcare regulations, environmental regulations, etc.)",
                "location": "8(c)"
            },
            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner of, and Consultant hereby assigns to Aduro, any and all writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\").",
                "changed_text": "Aduro shall generally be considered the owner of, and Consultant intends to assign to Aduro, writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\").",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be the sole and exclusive owner' to 'shall generally be considered the owner' and 'hereby assigns' to 'intends to assign' introduces significant ambiguity regarding ownership of the Work Product. The use of 'generally' implies that Aduro's ownership is not absolute. The statement that the consultant 'intends' to assign does not guarantee that assignment which is a contradiction against intellectual property regulations.",

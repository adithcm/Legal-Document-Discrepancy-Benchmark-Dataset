                "original_text": "Consultant represents as follows: (a) Consultant is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate by signing this Agreement; (b) Consultant has and shall continue to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and required skill to perform, and shall perform, the Services in a professional manner; (c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law; and (d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict.",
                "changed_text": "Consultant represents as follows: (a) Consultant will try not to violate any other agreement by signing this Agreement; (b) Consultant believes they possess the knowledge, experience, qualifications, and skill to perform the Services in a professional manner; (c) Consultant will endeavor to perform the Services in accordance with Applicable Law; and (d) Consultant will attempt to avoid engaging in conflicting consulting services during the term of this Agreement. If a potential conflict of interest arises, Consultant will inform the Company's General Counsel, and the Company and Consultant will consider whether to resolve such conflicts. Consultant might recuse herself from providing Services if requested by the Company's General Counsel.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate' with 'will try not to violate,' 'has and shall continue to have' with 'believes they possess,' 'shall perform...in accordance with all Applicable Law' with 'will endeavor to perform,' and 'will not' with 'will attempt to avoid,' the obligations become significantly weaker and discretionary. The original text creates a firm commitment, while the modified text introduces uncertainty about the Consultant's commitment and adherence to laws and other agreements. The word 'might' in the last sentence further weakens the requirement that Consultant recuse herself from services if there is a conflict.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires parties to fulfill contractual obligations in good faith, and this weakens the Consultant's obligations.",

Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro.",

Consultant should disclose to Aduro information relating to Work Product when feasible as part of the Services and if requested by Aduro.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Aduro shall be the sole and exclusive owner' to 'Aduro shall endeavor to be the owner' introduces ambiguity regarding the ownership of the work product, potentially conflicting with California's intellectual property laws that require a clear assignment of ownership. Additionally, changing 'Consultant shall promptly disclose' to 'Consultant should disclose when feasible' weakens the obligation to disclose information, making it discretionary and not mandatory.",

If Consultant is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant shall promptly notify Aduro to allow Aduro a reasonable time to oppose such process and Consultant shall reasonably cooperate in Aduro's efforts.",

If Consultant is requested by judicial or administrative process to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant will attempt to notify Aduro in a timely manner.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall keep all Confidential Information confidential\" with \"shall make reasonable efforts to keep Confidential Information confidential\" significantly weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality, making it subject to interpretation of what 'reasonable efforts' constitute. Changing \"shall not disclose\" to \"will try not to disclose\" adds more uncertainty. The modified text contradicts the expectation of strict confidentiality expected in business relationships and introduces subjectivity, making it difficult to enforce the confidentiality obligation. The change from 'shall promptly notify' to 'will attempt to notify in a timely manner' weakens the notification requirement, further undermining the ability of Aduro to protect its confidential information through legal means.",

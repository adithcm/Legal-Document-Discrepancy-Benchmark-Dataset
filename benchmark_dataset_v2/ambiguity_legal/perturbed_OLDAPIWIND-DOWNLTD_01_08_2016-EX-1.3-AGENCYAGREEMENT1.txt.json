                "changed_text": "The Corporation represents, warrants, and covenants to the Agents, and acknowledges that the Agents are relying upon such representations, warranties, and covenants, that: (d) the Corporation has endeavored to conduct its business in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including all applicable federal, national, provincial, municipal, and local environmental anti-pollution and licensing laws, regulations, and other lawful requirements of any governmental or regulatory body of each jurisdiction in which its business is carried on and is licensed, registered, or qualified). The Corporation believes it holds the necessary licenses, registrations, and qualifications to enable its business to be carried on as now conducted and its property and assets to be owned, leased, and operated. The validity and subsistence of such licenses, registrations, and qualifications are not guaranteed. The Corporation has not necessarily received a notice of non-compliance, but it may or may not be aware of facts that could give rise to one.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. Replacing 'has conducted its business in compliance, in all material respects' with 'has endeavored to conduct its business in compliance' weakens the obligation. The statement about believing it holds necessary licenses, but not guaranteeing their validity, creates uncertainty. The disclaimer regarding awareness of potential non-compliance is vague and undermines the original warranty. This contradicts environmental regulations that require strict compliance.",

                "changed_text": "(x) Neither the Corporation nor, based on a general understanding, any director, officer, agent, employee, affiliate or other person acting on behalf of the Corporation has knowingly taken any direct action that is definitively proven to result in a clear violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (United States), as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"FCPA\"), and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) (the \"CFPOA\"), including making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer or authorization of the payment of money or property to a foreign official in contravention of the FCPA and the CFPOA. The Corporation intends to generally monitor its businesses for broad compliance and will consider action if significant violations are evident.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several layers of ambiguity that contradict the intent and enforcement of anti-corruption laws. The original text states a clear lack of awareness of any actions violating FCPA/CFPOA. The revised text adds conditions, i.e., 'general understanding', 'knowingly taken', 'definitively proven', 'clear violation', and 'intends to generally monitor', significantly weakening the obligation and making it harder to prove non-compliance. The FCPA and CFPOA require proactive measures and don't require a definitive proven violation; they target intent and potential.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a definitive statement that Equity Financial Trust Company has been duly appointed. The modified clause introduces significant doubt by using phrases like 'It is believed that...may have been considered' and 'no guarantee of their current status or continued service.'

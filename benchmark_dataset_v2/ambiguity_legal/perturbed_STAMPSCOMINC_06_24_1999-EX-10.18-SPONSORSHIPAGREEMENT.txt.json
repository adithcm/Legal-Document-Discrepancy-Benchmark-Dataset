                "explanation": "The original text provides a reasonable standard, requiring client use reasonable efforts to assist in implementation, and requires the parties to recognize that certain things are required to meet the Launch Date. The modified text softens 'will use reasonable efforts' to 'will endeavor, where practical', making the level of effort discretionary. Replacing 'can be met only if' with 'may be met if' significantly lowers the threshold for meeting the Launch Date. The use of 'attempts' with 'reasonably valid' also weakens the requirement for quality. This undermines a material term of the agreement, thus creating non-compliance.",

Client may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Client unless the number of Impressions are determined to have been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Impressions due to Client, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.   In addition, if the audit reveals such shortfall in the number of Impressions generated, Intuit shall continue to display Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links on the Intuit Sites as set forth herein.  The audit rights set forth herein shall continue for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement for any reason.  No such audit may occur more than once a year during the Term.",

The fees charged by the auditor in connection with the inspection will be addressed by the client. If the audit reveals a shortfall in Impressions generated, Intuit may continue to display Client's Advertisements.  The audit rights set forth herein shall continue following the termination of this Agreement.  No such audit may occur more than once a year during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets forth the requirement to maintain 'accurate' records and it also allows client to 'cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records'. It states that 'In addition, if the audit reveals such shortfall in the number of Impressions generated, Intuit shall continue to display Client's Banner Advertisements'. The modified text removes 'accurate', removes the requirement that the auditor be 'independent', as well as the 'all relevant records' and removes the 30 days written notice. The modified text also states that Intuit 'may' instead of 'shall' continue to display the advertisement. This change weakens the auditing powers and creates ambiguity around the procedure, potentially hindering the client's ability to verify impression counts. The removal of '95% of the Impressions due to Client' creates further ambiguity about the trigger point for Intuit to continue displaying ads. The original text provides an recourse. This change introduces ambiguity in the client's ability to get recourse if Intuit has a shortfall on impressions.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains fixed guidelines of the process. The modified text introduces ambiguity into the transaction payments. 'Reasonable timeframe' doesn't stipulate how long Client has to create report. Removing '15 days' adds ambiguity. All of the following phrases add ambiguity and make the text open to interpretation: 'percentage' doesn't state what percentage to pay, 'generally summarize' doesn't provide detail of report, and 'after the report is compiled' doesn't provide how long Client has to pay fees.",

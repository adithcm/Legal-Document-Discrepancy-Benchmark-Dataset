                "original_text": "Intuit will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of Impressions delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Client may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours.",
                "changed_text": "Intuit will endeavor to maintain records with respect to the calculation of Impressions delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Client may, with reasonable notice to Intuit, request an inspection of relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during mutually convenient business hours.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'accurate records,' whereas the modified version weakens this obligation by stating Intuit will 'endeavor to maintain records.' Additionally, 'no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice' is replaced with 'reasonable notice', and 'Client's normal business hours' is changed to 'mutually convenient business hours,' introducing ambiguity about the timing and scope of the audit. This contradicts generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which requires businesses to maintain comprehensive accounting records.",

                "explanation": "The original text is a strict prohibition, while the modified version uses phrases like 'try to avoid' and 'discourage', weakening the obligation. Adding 'directly' also creates a loophole, allowing for indirect promotion of competitors. This introduces ambiguity and might conflict with the spirit, if not the letter, of the exclusivity agreement, potentially harming the client. This may run afoul of California's Unfair Competition Law (Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq.) if it allows Intuit to unfairly compete with Stamps.com.",

                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear duty to defend and indemnify, while the modified version introduces uncertainty with phrases like 'will consider defending,' 'potential breach,' 'arguably infringe,' and 'what Client considers to be reasonable costs'. This makes the obligation subjective and dependent on Client's interpretation, potentially leaving Intuit vulnerable.

                "explanation": "The change from 'covenants that it is and will remain in compliance' to 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the legal obligation, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The change of 'includes' to 'may include' means that the listing of laws is optional.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'will aim to meet' is vague and doesn't guarantee compliance with international standards. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation on the Manufacturer. ",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'covenants that it is and will remain' with 'will use commercially reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of compliance required. 'Could include' makes it so the company does not need to include the following laws.",

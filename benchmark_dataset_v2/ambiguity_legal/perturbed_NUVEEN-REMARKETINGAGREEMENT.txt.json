                "original_text": "The Remarketing Agent may sell VRRM-MFP Shares for its own account outside of a remarketing at a price other than the Purchase Price.",
                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent may consider selling VRRM-MFP Shares for its own account outside of a remarketing at a price that it deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'may sell' with 'may consider selling' and 'a price other than the Purchase Price' with 'a price that it deems appropriate,' the obligation to adhere to a specific price point is removed, introducing ambiguity and making the obligation subjective. This creates uncertainty regarding the transparency and fairness of transactions, potentially conflicting with regulatory expectations for fair dealing in securities markets.",

                "original_text": "The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [‚óè], a report of 6 portfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.",
                "changed_text": "The Fund will endeavor to provide to the Remarketing Agent, within a reasonable timeframe following the end of each calendar month, a report of its portfolio holdings. The Remarketing Agent may, at its discretion, share information from such reports with investors if it considers it suitable.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the obligation. Replacing 'agrees to deliver within fifteen (15) calendar days' with 'will endeavor to provide within a reasonable timeframe' makes the timing and delivery of portfolio reports uncertain. Similarly, changing 'may provide such report...upon the investor's request' to 'may...share information...if it considers it suitable' introduces discretion on whether to share the data, thereby contradicting the requirement to ensure investors have access to material information. The use of 'reasonable timeframe' and 'considers it suitable' are vague and open to interpretation.",

                "original_text": "In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Statement, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents.",
                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent is generally expected to review documents furnished to it, and may rely on them unless explicitly notified otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a safe harbor for the Remarketing Agent, allowing reliance on documents as long as there is no bad faith. The changed text removes the 'conclusively rely' provision and replaces it with a general expectation of review, but introduces ambiguity by not defining the scope or depth of the review. It also replaces the defined condition of 'bad faith' with the ambiguous 'unless explicitly notified otherwise,' creating uncertainty about the agent's responsibility to independently verify information. This weakens the duty of care and could conflict with regulatory expectations for due diligence.",

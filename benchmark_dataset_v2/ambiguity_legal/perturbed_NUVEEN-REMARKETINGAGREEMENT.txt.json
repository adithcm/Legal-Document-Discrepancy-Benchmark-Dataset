                "explanation": "Changing 'use its best efforts' to 'endeavor' reduces the standard of effort required. Stating that the Remarketing Agent is only liable for 'gross negligence' provides a loophole that weakens their responsibility to diligently find purchasers for the Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares. This introduces ambiguity and makes it more difficult to hold the agent accountable for failing to remarket shares effectively. The original text clearly states that the remarketing agent will not be liable if no purchases are found, provided it has otherwise performed its obligations. By changing it to only be liable if no purchasers are found due to gross negligence, it will be difficult to prove what may be a lower standard of diligence, which weakens the obligation.",

While not explicitly violated, the weakened obligation could lead to practices that do not meet the expected standards of due diligence, potentially violating principles of fair dealing and investor protection.",

                "original_text": "The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [‚óè], a report of portfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.",
                "changed_text": "The Fund will aim (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within a reasonable time following the end of each month, a summary report of portfolio holdings, and (ii) that the Remarketing Agent has the option to share such report, or relevant details, with potential investors, as they see fit.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to deliver within fifteen calendar days' to 'will aim to deliver within a reasonable time' significantly weakens the obligation. 'Reasonable time' is subjective and could be interpreted in multiple ways, thereby creating ambiguity. Removing the specific content requirements of the report ('listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount') further reduces the Fund's responsibility. The phrase 'has the option to share such report, or relevant details, with potential investors, as they see fit' makes providing the report discretionary and weakens the transparency available to investors. The original text makes providing a report mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC regulations regarding transparency and disclosure of fund holdings. These regulations aim to ensure investors have access to detailed information about fund portfolios, which this weakened obligation undermines, potentially violating the spirit, if not the letter, of those regulations.",

Any costs and expenses associated with such inspections shall be for the account of the party requesting such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent will maintain records related to its duties, and will consider, in good faith, requests from the Fund to review high-level summaries of these records where practical. Costs for such reviews may be discussed and potentially shared.",
                "explanation": "The original language mandates the Remarketing Agent keep books consistent with industry practice and make them available for inspection. The changed text weakens this by saying the Remarketing Agent 'will maintain records' (less specific than 'books and records') and 'will consider, in good faith, requests from the Fund to review high-level summaries' (rather than making the books available for inspection). Adding 'where practical' creates ambiguity and gives the Remarketing Agent discretion to deny reviews. Changing 'shall be for the account of the party requesting such inspection' to 'Costs for such reviews may be discussed and potentially shared' further reduces obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC Rule 31a-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires specific record-keeping practices for investment companies and their agents, including the right of the investment company to inspect those records. The revised wording creates loopholes for the Remarketing Agent to limit access and reduce transparency, hindering compliance with SEC requirements.",

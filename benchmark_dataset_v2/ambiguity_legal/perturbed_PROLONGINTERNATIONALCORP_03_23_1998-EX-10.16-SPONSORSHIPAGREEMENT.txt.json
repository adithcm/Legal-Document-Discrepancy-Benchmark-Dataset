                "original_text": "Sabco shall provide at its expense and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement and any option period spectator liability insurance in an amount not less than $1 million single limit coverage with respect to any liability relating to the activities of Sabco in the performance of this Agreement. Sabco shall, within 90 days of the execution of this Agreement, supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 10 days written notice to Prolong.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco will attempt to provide spectator liability insurance during the term of this Agreement. Sabco will endeavor to supply Prolong with a copy of an insurance policy or a certificate thereof at some point after the execution of this agreement, and policies might be cancelable with reasonable notice to Prolong.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear obligation for Sabco to provide and maintain spectator liability insurance. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall provide' with 'will attempt to provide,' 'shall supply' with 'will endeavor to supply', removing the $1 million minimum, removing the 90-day deadline, and allowing cancelation with 'reasonable notice' instead of 10 days. This ambiguity makes the insurance requirement less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and certainty in contractual obligations. Also, depending on the scale of events held by Sabco, such vague insurance provisions may fail to meet standard risk management requirements, potentially violating duties of care to spectators which can fall under tort law. If the auto racing events are to be held on property that requires insurance coverage, this could lead to a breach of the property agreements. The specific state law is North Carolina (specified in section 17).",

                "original_text": "Sabco will use its best efforts to obtain favorable exposure for Prolong and will be available to assist Prolong with public relations activities to a reasonable extent. This shall include making members of Sabco available for media interviews, press conferences or other public relations activity, as reasonably requested by Prolong, at or near race sites on dates Sabco is at race sites pursuant to their obligations hereunder. Sabco shall provide at its expense a staff member to handle race team's media and public relations needs and shall cause Prolong to receive prominent mention and display within press kits featuring the Sabco No. 40, 42 and 46 race cars.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco may, at its discretion, try to obtain exposure for Prolong and may be available to assist Prolong with public relations activities as it sees fit. This could include making members of Sabco potentially available for media engagements, if convenient for Sabco. Sabco might provide a staff member, resources permitting, and may consider mentioning Prolong in press materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes an obligation on Sabco to actively seek favorable exposure for Prolong. The modified text uses language like 'may, at its discretion', 'may be available as it sees fit', 'potentially available', 'if convenient for Sabco', 'might provide', and 'may consider', all of which create loopholes and make Sabco's obligation vague and discretionary, therefore unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and good faith. Under North Carolina law, every contract imposes an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. The modified language allows Sabco to avoid meaningful engagement with Prolong's publicity needs, thus violating the implied duty of good faith.",

This sponsorship fee of $ [ * ] shall be paid to Sabco in the following installments: Year One (1998): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/98, 6/15/98, 8/15/98 and 10/15/98); Year Two (1999): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/99, 6/15/99, 8/15/99 and 10/15/99); Year Three (year-2000): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/2000, 6/15/2000,8/15/2000 and 10/15/2000).",

                "explanation": "The original clearly defines the compensation and payment schedule. The modified version introduces vagueness by replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'will aim to pay' and replacing specific amounts and dates with 'may be paid in installments' and 'will be determined at a later date'. This renders the compensation clause unenforceable as there is no fixed agreement on the amount or timing of payments.",
                "contradicted_law": "Basic contract law requires a definitive agreement on price and payment terms. A contract lacking these essential terms may be deemed unenforceable for lack of definiteness. The original clause had consideration agreed upon and terms of payment, removing these would void the contract. (North Carolina contract law)",

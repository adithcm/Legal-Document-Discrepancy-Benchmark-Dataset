                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall endeavor to conform to: (i) most applicable provisions of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) most provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust, as reasonably interpreted; and (iv) generally applicable provisions of state and federal law.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Adviser to 'at all times conform to' several legal documents and laws. The modified text weakens this obligation by introducing ambiguity. Replacing 'all applicable provisions' with 'most applicable provisions' and 'any other applicable provisions' with 'generally applicable provisions' makes it unclear which provisions the Adviser is required to follow. Adding 'as reasonably interpreted' introduces further subjectivity. This could allow the Adviser to selectively comply with regulations, creating potential conflicts of interest.",

Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall create and maintain records as it deems reasonably necessary in accordance with generally applicable laws, rules and regulations, potentially including records related to Section 31(a) of the Act and related rules, as amended, pertaining to its functions, unless another party handles this by contract with the Trust. Where practically feasible, such records may be maintained for periods and in locations suggested by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Adviser must maintain all necessary records according to all applicable laws, specifically referencing Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rule 31a-2. The modified text introduces several ambiguities. 'As it deems reasonably necessary' makes record-keeping subjective. 'Potentially including records related to Section 31(a)' weakens the direct requirement to comply with this section. 'Where practically feasible' makes compliance with Rule 31a-2 discretionary. This change undermines the strict record-keeping requirements mandated by the Investment Company Act, potentially hindering regulatory oversight and investor protection.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from any inaccurate or incomplete statement provided by the Adviser (or its officers, employees, directors and agents) for inclusion in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser will consider defending and indemnifying the Trust, its trustees, officers, and agents against certain liabilities, losses, claims, and damages potentially arising from materially inaccurate or incomplete statements knowingly provided by the Adviser (or its personnel) for inclusion in Fund documents. The Adviser will also consider defending and indemnifying the Trust from liabilities resulting from judicially determined gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Adviser, as definitively proven in a court of law.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits the Adviser to defend and indemnify the Trust against liabilities from inaccurate statements and misconduct. The modified text weakens this commitment by replacing 'agrees to defend and indemnify' with 'will consider defending and indemnifying,' making the action discretionary. The addition of 'potentially arising from materially inaccurate or incomplete statements knowingly provided' limits the scope of indemnification to only intentional misstatements that are 'material', and require statements to be 'knowingly provided'. Requiring the existence of judicially determined gross negligence or willful misconduct limits the scope of indemnification, and creates a high bar for the Trust to meet. This ambiguity significantly reduces the protection afforded to the Trust, potentially violating regulatory requirements for fund governance and investor protection.",

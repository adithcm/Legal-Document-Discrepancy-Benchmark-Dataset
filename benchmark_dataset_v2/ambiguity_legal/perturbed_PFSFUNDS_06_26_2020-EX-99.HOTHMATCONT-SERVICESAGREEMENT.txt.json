                "original_text": "The Adviser shall at all times conform to: (i) all applicable provisions of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) the provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust; and (iv) any other applicable provisions of state and federal law.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall endeavor to conform to: (i) generally applicable provisions of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) the general provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust to a reasonable extent; and (iv) applicable provisions of state and federal law as deemed necessary by the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates strict adherence to all applicable laws and regulations. The modified version introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall at all times conform' with 'shall endeavor to conform' and adding qualifiers such as 'generally applicable,' 'general provisions,' 'to a reasonable extent,' and 'as deemed necessary by the Adviser.' This makes compliance discretionary, potentially conflicting with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires strict adherence to regulations.",

Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall create and maintain records as it deems necessary and appropriate, with consideration to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, records related to Section 31(a) of the Act. Such records shall be maintained for a reasonable period and at locations deemed suitable by the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires the Adviser to maintain all necessary records according to strict legal standards. The modified version uses subjective terms like 'deems necessary and appropriate,' 'consideration to,' 'reasonable period,' and 'locations deemed suitable.' This introduces ambiguity and discretionary interpretation, potentially violating Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2, which specify clear requirements for record keeping.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a firm obligation for the Adviser to defend and indemnify the Trust in cases of willful misconduct or negligence. The modification weakens this obligation by introducing terms like 'consider defending,' 'potentially arising,' and 'subject to the Adviser's sole discretion and financial capacity.' This makes the indemnification discretionary, potentially violating the fiduciary duty of the Adviser under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which implies a stronger obligation to protect the Trust from harm caused by the Adviser's misconduct.",

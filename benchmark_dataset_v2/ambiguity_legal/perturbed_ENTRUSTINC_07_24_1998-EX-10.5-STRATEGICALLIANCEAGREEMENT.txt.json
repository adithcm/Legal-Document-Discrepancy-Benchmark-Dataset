                "changed_text": "NTL shall endeavor to perform the obligations to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that NTL shall make all reasonable efforts to perform obligations in all material respects to keep licenses in good standing. The modified text removes the 'reasonable efforts' and 'in all material respects', making the obligation vague and subjective, reducing NTL's responsibility to maintain licenses, and replacing it with the ambiguous 'endeavor'.",

                "explanation": "This change replaces 'shall comply in all material respects' with 'shall strive to comply,' which introduces ambiguity. Compliance is no longer mandatory and absolute, but rather a goal to be pursued. Additionally, it replaces 'Entrust benefits' with 'it generally benefits', changing the obligation from definite to ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "Entrust will aim to follow the obligations in such agreements as long as it finds them generally beneficial.",
                "explanation": "Replaces 'shall comply' with the subjective 'will aim to follow', removing the mandatory aspect of compliance. It also replaces 'Entrust benefits' with 'it finds them generally beneficial,' introducing further ambiguity. ",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "NTL shall make all reasonable efforts to perform in all material respects the obligations required to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology in good standing for their respective terms. NTL shall not make any material change to the licenses for Nortel Technology without the consent of ETI, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "NTL should endeavor to perform the obligations to maintain the licenses for the NTL Technology. NTL may make material changes to the licenses for Nortel Technology, and ETI's consent will be appreciated.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall make all reasonable efforts' to 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation to maintain licenses. Removing the 'in all material respects' clause adds further ambiguity. Replacing 'shall not make any material change without consent' with 'may make material changes, and ETI's consent will be appreciated' makes consent optional, creating an ambiguous legal obligation. The governing law is Ontario, Canada, and this may contradict implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in contractual performance, which require reasonable and honest conduct.",

ETI shall pay to NTL the portion of all fees and charges paid by Nortel to obtain continuing rights to the NTL Technology that are reasonably attributable to Entrust's actual use of the NTL Technology.",
                "changed_text": "Entrust should consider complying with the obligations under the licenses for the NTL Technology for so long as Entrust benefits from those licenses. ETI will attempt to pay to NTL a portion of fees and charges paid by Nortel for continuing rights to the NTL Technology.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply in all material respects' with 'should consider complying' weakens the obligation, introducing ambiguity. Replacing 'shall pay' with 'will attempt to pay' makes the payment obligation uncertain and discretionary. This can create conflicts under contract law in Ontario, Canada, where there is an expectation of definite contractual terms, which includes the obligation to pay fees and charges as they are laid out in the contract.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "For so long as ETI remains a Subsidiary of NTL, Entrust shall not take any action or enter into any commitment or agreement which may reasonably be anticipated based on notice from Nortel to result, with or without notice and with or without lapse of time or otherwise, in a contravention or event of default by any Nortel Entity of (i) any provisions of applicable law or regulation, (ii) any provision of NTL's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (iii) any credit agreement or other material instrument binding upon Nortel, or (iv) any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over Nortel or any of its assets.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall not take any action' with 'should try not to take actions' weakens the obligation, introducing ambiguity. The use of 'Nortel considers might lead to an issue' makes the trigger subjective and uncertain, contradicting the need for objective and measurable standards in contractual obligations under Ontario law. Removing detailed and legally precise descriptions with simpler language also makes the provision less enforceable.",

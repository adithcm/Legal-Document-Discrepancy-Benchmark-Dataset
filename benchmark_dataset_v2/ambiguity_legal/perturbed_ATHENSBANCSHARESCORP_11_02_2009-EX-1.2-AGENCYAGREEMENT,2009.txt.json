                "explanation": "Replacing 'best efforts' with 'endeavor' and making the notification dependent on what 'they deem necessary' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to proactively pursue regulatory approvals and inform the Agent of potentially relevant events.

The Company authorizes the Agent to use the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if amended or supplemented) in any lawful manner contemplated by the Plan in connection with the sale of the Shares by the Agent.",

The Company allows the Agent to use the Prospectus in a manner they consider suitable in connection with the sale of Shares.",
                "explanation": "This modification makes the provision of the prospectus vague by changing 'such number of copies as the Agent may reasonably request' to 'some copies as they find practical.' Also, changing 'any lawful manner contemplated by the Plan' to 'a manner they consider suitable' makes the permitted use of the prospectus subjective and undefined. This conflicts with requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 regarding the accurate and timely delivery of the prospectus to potential investors.",

The Bank will maintain such records of all funds received to permit the funds of each subscriber to be separately insured by the FDIC (to the maximum extent allowable) and to enable the Bank to make the appropriate refunds of such funds in the event that such refunds are required to be made in accordance with the Plan and as described in the Prospectus.",

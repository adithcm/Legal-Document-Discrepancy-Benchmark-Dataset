                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the Company and Bank to use their best efforts to ensure regulatory compliance and to immediately notify the Agent of any relevant information. By changing 'will use their best efforts' to 'will aim to cause', 'will immediately notify' to 'may notify', and adding qualifiers such as 'potentially', 'perhaps', and 'possible,' the obligation becomes ambiguous and discretionary. This weakens the commitment to regulatory compliance and transparency.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with all material terms imposed by regulatory bodies and securities laws. Modifying 'will comply' to 'will generally aim to comply' and 'will attempt to comply,' and inserting subjective phrases like 'as deemed appropriate' and 'as necessary' introduces ambiguity. This makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory, potentially leading to non-compliance with securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a clear obligation for the Company and the Bank to take actions to cooperate with the Agent in registering or exempting the Shares under securities laws. Replacing 'will take such actions in cooperating' with 'will consider cooperating' and 'may furnish some information' transforms the mandatory cooperation into a discretionary one. Including 'at their discretion, to be sold' makes the obligation to comply with securities laws dependent on whether the Company chooses to sell the shares in a particular jurisdiction, which contradicts the mandatory nature of securities law compliance.",

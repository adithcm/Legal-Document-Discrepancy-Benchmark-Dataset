                "changed_text": "SONY hereby assigns to PURCHASER SONY's entire right, title and interest in, to and under the Transferred Patents, and any patents that may issue therefrom (including any foreign counterparts, divisions, continuations, renewals, continuations in part, reexaminations or reissues thereof), along with the right to sue and collect damages for future infringement. SONY agrees to consider assisting PURCHASER, at PURCHASER's expense, with registering, confirming, and perfecting such assignment, potentially including filings with patent offices or governmental agencies, as SONY deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly obligates SONY to take all reasonably necessary actions to assist PURCHASER. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating SONY only 'agrees to consider assisting,' and only 'as SONY deems appropriate'. This makes the obligation discretionary, creating uncertainty about SONY's actual responsibility.",
                "contradicted_law": "Patent law requires clear assignment of rights and cooperation in registering those rights, and this ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the assignment, potentially conflicting with the spirit of patent regulations regarding transfer of ownership.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party may, at its discretion, apply for and register for protection for, prosecute, and maintain any of its Intellectual Property. The Party may also determine, as it sees fit, whether or not, and where, to apply for and/or register such protection, to abandon attempts to obtain protection, or discontinue Intellectual Property maintenance without a strict obligation to inform the other Party, unless reasonably requested.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each party has no obligation to inform the other party of actions or inactions regarding intellectual property. The modified text introduces a vague exception of 'unless reasonably requested.' What constitutes a 'reasonable request' is undefined, creating ambiguity and potential disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "This ambiguity can conflict with the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts, especially if one party's actions regarding IP protection significantly affect the other party's rights or interests under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text firmly establishes that both parties have caused the agreement to be executed by authorized officers. The modified version softens this by saying the parties have 'considered executing', 'potentially in duplicate', 'officers who may be duly authorized' and 'approximately the day and year'. All the changes weaken and introduce ambiguity on the certainty and legitimacy of the execution and date. \n",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires certainty in execution and terms. Introducing ambiguity on whether or not the agreement has even been executed can undermine its enforceability and creates legal uncertainty. The date of the execution is also a key element in court.",

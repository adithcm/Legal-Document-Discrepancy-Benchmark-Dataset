                "original_text": "Company shall at all times make reasonable efforts to maintain quality control and to deliver Products to Distributor which, when received by Distributor, or, as the case may be, the end-user, are properly and adequately packaged and contained, fully assembled (except for miscellaneous components which may be shipped separately to prevent damage in transit), fully functional and otherwise in conformance with the warranties set forth herein.  Company warrants that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a workmanlike manner and that such Products shall be fully functional and fit for their intended purposes.  Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
                "changed_text": "Company should endeavor to maintain a certain level of quality control and attempt to deliver Products to Distributor which, when received by Distributor, or, as the case may be, the end-user, are packaged and contained, mostly assembled, generally functional and somewhat in conformance with the warranties set forth herein. Company suggests that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in an acceptable manner and that such Products should be generally functional and suitable for their intended purposes. Company indicates that the Products sold hereunder will be mostly free from major defects in design, materials and workmanship for approximately two years after delivery to Distributor's end-user.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the warranty obligation by replacing 'shall' with 'should endeavor,' 'attempt to deliver', 'mostly assembled', 'generally functional', 'somewhat in conformance', and 'acceptable manner' making the quality control requirements vague and discretionary rather than mandatory. Also changing '24 months' to 'approximately two years', and changing the original statement to use words such as 'suggests', and 'indicates' eliminates clear legal requirements, and replacing 'shall be' with 'should be' creates uncertainty. This contradicts the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires clear and definite warranties for product quality and fitness.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor is expected to periodically provide updates to the Company during the first year of the Term, approximately ninety (90) days after signing this Agreement, generally outlining its activities and possible clients.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall submit written reports' to 'is expected to periodically provide updates', weakening the mandatory reporting obligation. Replacing 'each quarter' with 'periodically' and 'commencing ninety (90) days' with 'approximately ninety (90) days' makes the frequency and timing of the reports vague. Substituting 'describing its efforts' with 'generally outlining its activities' reduces the specificity of the required content. This contradicts general contract law principles that require clear and definite obligations, making it difficult for the Company to enforce timely and comprehensive reporting.",

                "original_text": "Company will carry a reasonable amount of product liability insurance through a reasonably acceptable products liability insurance company and will name the Distributor as an additional insured under that policy. Company will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice to the Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Company may attempt to carry some product liability insurance through a potentially suitable insurance provider and consider naming the Distributor as an additional insured. Company might try to obtain a policy that is ideally non-cancelable, possibly with some advance notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'will carry' with 'may attempt to carry' makes the insurance coverage discretionary. Changing 'a reasonable amount' to 'some' and 'a reasonably acceptable products liability insurance company' to 'a potentially suitable insurance provider' introduces vagueness about the coverage level and insurer's quality. Changing 'will name' to 'consider naming' makes adding the Distributor as an insured uncertain. Similarly, changing 'will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice' to 'might try to obtain a policy that is ideally non-cancelable, possibly with some advance notice' weakens the obligation to provide a non-cancelable policy with adequate notice. This contradicts basic principles of contract law that require duties to be performed with definitive parameters.",

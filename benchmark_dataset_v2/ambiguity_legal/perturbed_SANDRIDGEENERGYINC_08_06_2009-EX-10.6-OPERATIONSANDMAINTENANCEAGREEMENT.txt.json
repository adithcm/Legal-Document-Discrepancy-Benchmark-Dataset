                "changed_text": "Operator shall endeavor to comply with Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits to the extent deemed reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict obligation on the operator to comply with all environmental laws and permits. The modified version introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall comply in all respects' to 'shall endeavor to comply' and adding the qualifier 'to the extent deemed reasonably practical.' This weakens the obligation, making it subject to the operator's judgment of what is 'reasonably practical,' which creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the operator to promptly pay all costs, creating a firm financial obligation. The modified version introduces ambiguity through phrases like 'strive to pay,' 'in a timely manner,' and 'subject to available funds.' These phrases weaken the obligation, making it conditional and less enforceable. This is an ambiguous legal obligation that could impact supplier payments and is open to interpretation.",

In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit.",
                "changed_text": "Operator should consider maintaining worker's compensation insurance for its employees and statutory employees, in general alignment with standard benefits. Additionally, Operator may obtain employer's liability insurance as deemed appropriate, aiming for coverage levels considered reasonable in similar contexts.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates statutory worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance with specific coverage limits. The revised text replaces 'shall maintain' with weaker language like 'should consider maintaining' and 'may obtain.' Specific coverage limits are removed in favor of vague references to 'general alignment with standard benefits' and 'coverage levels considered reasonable.' This creates a significant ambiguity about the level of worker protections and employer liability coverage, which contradicts the mandatory requirements set forth in Texas Labor Code - Section 406.002. EMPLOYERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE",

                "original_text": "LEA shall keep such written records respecting Cash Sales as T&B may reasonably request so that Royalty Payments payable hereunder may be accurately determined and shall permit such records to be examined by T&B or its authorized representative upon reasonable prior written notice at any reasonable time during regular business hours to verify the records, reports and payments herein provided.",
                "changed_text": "LEA will keep records respecting Cash Sales as T&B may, from time to time, request. LEA will allow T&B or its representative to review said records with what LEA deems to be reasonable notice during mutually agreed upon times.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the record-keeping obligations of LEA and grants T&B the right to examine these records with reasonable notice. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'from time to time' and 'deems to be reasonable notice,' making the requirements and timing of audits subjective and open to interpretation. Additionally, 'mutually agreed upon times' makes the accessibility of records more difficult to access.",

T&B and Tarek El Moussa shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance and proof of such inclusion shall be provided to T&B.",
                "changed_text": "LEA will attempt to defend, hold harmless and indemnify T&B and T&B's agents and employees from claims, demands, losses, disputes, causes of action or damages, including FTC actions, regulatory actions, and/or attorneys' fees arising out of or relating to the promotion, distribution and/or sale of any financial education programs, products or services by or through LEA, and may obtain insurance.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'will attempt to' makes the indemnification obligation discretionary. Removing the specific insurance requirements and replacing it with 'may obtain insurance' further weakens LEA's obligation to maintain adequate coverage. This creates ambiguity about the extent of LEA's liability and the protection afforded to T&B.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts general contract law principles regarding indemnification, where clear and unambiguous terms are required. The ambiguity might make the indemnification clause unenforceable, leaving T&B without the intended protection.",

                "changed_text": "The parties will consider executing and delivering further documents, agreements, and instruments and taking further action as they independently deem suitable to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to execute and deliver' with 'will consider executing and delivering' weakens the obligation to create further necessary legal documents. The phrase 'independently deem suitable' adds further ambiguity, granting each party unilateral discretion over actions required to fulfill the agreement's intent. The added subjectivity prevents enforcement.",

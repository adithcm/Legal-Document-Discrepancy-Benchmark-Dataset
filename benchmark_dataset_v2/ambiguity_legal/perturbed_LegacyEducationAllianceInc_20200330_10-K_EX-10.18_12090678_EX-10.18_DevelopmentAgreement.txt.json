                "original_text": "LEA shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents, contractors, employees, successor, and assigns from and against all claims, demands or causes of action, as well as any and all damages, expenses, costs, interest and reasonable legal fees, including such fees incurred on appeal, in any way related to, arising out of or connected with a breach of the indemnifying party's representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "LEA shall endeavor to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents, contractors, employees, successor, and assigns from and against all plausible claims, demands or causes of action, as well as some damages, expenses, costs, interest and potentially reasonable legal fees, including fees incurred on appeal, somewhat related to, arising out of or loosely connected with a breach of the indemnifying party's representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless' with 'shall endeavor to defend, indemnify and hold harmless' makes the obligation discretionary. The use of 'plausible claims' creates uncertainty about which claims are covered. The addition of 'some damages,' 'potentially reasonable legal fees,' and 'somewhat related to' further weakens the obligation, leaving it open to interpretation and dispute. It isn't clear which fees are valid, leaving it open to arbitrary descision.",

                "original_text": "LEA shall obtain and maintain necessary insurance, including, without limitation, Commercial General Liability Insurance, including product liability insurance, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, defamation, contractual liability and personal and advertising injury liability insurance in an amount no less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) per occurrence and ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) aggregate combined single limit.",
                "changed_text": "LEA shall attempt to obtain and maintain some form of insurance, perhaps including Commercial General Liability Insurance, possibly encompassing product liability insurance, potential trademark infringement, copyright infringement, defamation, contractual liability and personal and advertising injury liability insurance in what they consider a reasonable amount per occurrence and an aggregate combined single limit.",
                "explanation": "The text is made ambiguous by replacing 'shall obtain and maintain necessary insurance' with 'shall attempt to obtain and maintain some form of insurance' which introduces uncertainty about the mandatory nature of insurance. Replacing 'including, without limitation' with 'perhaps including' and 'possibly encompassing' again makes the coverage of types of insurance not required. Finally, replacing 'no less than ten million dollars' with 'what they consider a reasonable amount' replaces an objective metric with a subjective one. This ambiguity could violate standard business practices and contractual obligations to obtain sufficient insurance coverage.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - failure to clearly define the insurance obligation undermines the purpose of risk mitigation and creates uncertainty about the level of financial protection provided, making the contract difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "T&B and Tarek El Moussa may potentially be named as an additional insured on such insurance if LEA deems it appropriate, and proof of such possible inclusion may be provided if requested.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear requirement for T&B and Tarek El Moussa to be named as additional insured parties. The modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall be named' with 'may potentially be named if LEA deems it appropriate,' giving LEA discretion over whether to include them. Additionally, changing 'proof of such inclusion shall be provided' to 'proof of such possible inclusion may be provided if requested' makes the provision of proof conditional and discretionary. This contradicts the original intent of ensuring that T&B and Tarek El Moussa are protected under LEA's insurance policy.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations; the ambiguous language undermines the intended protection for T&B and Tarek El Moussa, making the obligation unenforceable.",

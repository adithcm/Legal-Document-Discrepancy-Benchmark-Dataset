                "explanation": "Changing 'shall devote such time and efforts, as it deems commercially reasonable' to 'will endeavor to devote time and effort...as it sees fit' weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' and 'sees fit' introduce subjectivity, undermining the original intent of a commercially reasonable and adequate level of service. This ambiguity could be interpreted as not fulfilling the contract's intended purpose of providing valuable services.",

Disclosure requirements regarding the required disclosure of the nature and terms of UTEK's relationship with, including, but not limited to press releases, publications on its web site, letters to investors and telephone or other personal communication with potential or current investors.\n\n  B. No press releases or any other forms of communication to third parties, which mention both UTEK and MKOS, shall be released without the prior written consent and approval of both UTEK and MKOS.",

Disclosure requirements may be considered regarding the nature and terms of UTEK's relationship, possibly including press releases.\n\n  B. MKOS will try to obtain consent for press releases mentioning both parties when practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates policies to ensure securities law compliance. The revised text weakens this by saying MKOS will 'consider' implementing policies and 'may be considered,' creating ambiguity. Replacing 'shall be released without prior written consent' with 'will try to obtain consent when practical' introduces discretion and undermines the prior written consent requirement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not divulge' to 'will make reasonable efforts not to divulge' weakens the obligation. Adding 'unless it deems it necessary' introduces a subjective exception. Replacing 'represents and warrants that it has established appropriate internal procedures' with 'intends to have internal procedures in place' removes the guarantee that such procedures exist.",

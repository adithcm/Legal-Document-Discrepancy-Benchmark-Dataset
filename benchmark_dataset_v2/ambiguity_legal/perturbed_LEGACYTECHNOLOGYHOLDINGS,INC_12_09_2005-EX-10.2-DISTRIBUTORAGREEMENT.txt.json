                "explanation": "The original text makes a definitive warranty, whereas the modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'endeavor to ensure.' This weakens the obligation and makes it less enforceable. SIERRA could argue they made an effort even if the product is ultimately adulterated or misbranded, creating uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "ENVISION warrants that the Finished Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law. In the event of any breach of this warranty or in the event any user of the Finished Product makes a claim that the Finished Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), ENVISION shall indemnify, defend, and hold SIERRA harmless from any liability occasioned by a breach of warranty or a product liability claim.  ENVISION warrants that it carries general liability insurance of $1 million per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence and that, upon execution of this Agreement, it will name SIERRA as an additional insured on such policies.",
                "changed_text": "ENVISION will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Finished Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law. In the event that ENVISION is found responsible, ENVISION will attempt to indemnify, defend, and hold SIERRA harmless from any liability related to a product liability claim. ENVISION may carry general liability insurance of $1 million per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence, if reasonably possible.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation weakens the warranty and indemnification clauses, as well as the insurance requirement. 'Reasonable efforts' creates ambiguity regarding ENVISION's duty to prevent adulteration or misbranding. Replacing 'shall indemnify' with 'will attempt to indemnify' makes the obligation to defend and hold harmless conditional. The term 'may carry' weakens the obligation to maintain insurance, making it non-mandatory. The addition of 'if reasonably possible' adds a condition that makes the $2 million insurance almost optional, going against the requirements in case of an actual claim.",

                "explanation": "The original language creates a strong, definitive obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless. The modified language weakens this obligation substantially by replacing 'hereby agrees' with 'will consider,' introducing significant ambiguity. This makes SIERRA's responsibility discretionary rather than mandatory, leaving ENVISION uncertain about whether SIERRA will actually provide support in case of a patent infringement claim.",

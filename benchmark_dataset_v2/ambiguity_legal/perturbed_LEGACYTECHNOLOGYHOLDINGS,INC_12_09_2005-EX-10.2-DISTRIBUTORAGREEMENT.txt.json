                "changed_text": "ENVISION will endeavor to market and sell the Finished Product throughout the Territory.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"best efforts\" with \"endeavor to\" introduces ambiguity. \"Endeavor to\" is a less stringent requirement than \"best efforts,\" making it difficult to enforce a specific level of marketing commitment. This is a perturbation because under contract law, 'best efforts' implies a higher standard of diligence than simply 'endeavoring'. This ambiguity can lead to disputes regarding the fulfillment of contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "SIERRA may withhold the Product if it deems it necessary, and shall not be liable for unfulfilled or partially fulfilled orders.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies 'just cause' for withholding product, providing a relatively objective standard. The modified clause replaces this with 'if it deems it necessary,' introducing a subjective standard based on SIERRA's discretion. This creates an ambiguous obligation because 'necessary' is not defined, giving SIERRA significant leeway and making it difficult for ENVISION to challenge a decision to withhold the product. Furthermore, this change eliminates the requirement for 'just cause', which could potentially contradict principles of good faith in contract performance.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - specifically the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "SIERRA provides a warranty that the Product should generally be free from significant defects in material and workmanship.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall be' with 'should generally be' and removing 'reasonable shelf life', the warranty's strength and duration are weakened. The addition of the word 'significant' also introduces ambiguity regarding the severity of defects covered by the warranty. This makes it harder for ENVISION to make a claim regarding a non-conforming product since it is uncertain what constitutes 'significant' and the timeframe is vague. This ambiguous obligation can lead to potential disputes regarding warranty claims.",

                "explanation": "The addition of \"to the best of their knowledge\" introduces ambiguity regarding the franchisor's responsibility to disclose pending litigation. This weakens the obligation and provides a loophole for non-disclosure, particularly if the franchisor deliberately avoids obtaining complete information. The phrase makes it more difficult to prove non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"has been convicted\" with \"may have been convicted\" introduces uncertainty regarding the disclosure of past convictions and civil actions.

                "explanation": "By adding qualifiers like \"only if such filing was deemed material\", \"only if the debts were substantial\" and \"only if they were aware of such filings\", the franchisor introduces subjectivity and ambiguity into the disclosure requirements regarding bankruptcy filings. These terms are vague and open to interpretation, potentially allowing the franchisor to avoid disclosing relevant bankruptcy information.

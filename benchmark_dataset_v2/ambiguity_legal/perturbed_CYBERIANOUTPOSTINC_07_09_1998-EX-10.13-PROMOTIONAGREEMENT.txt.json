                "original_text": "The Company will be responsible for ensuring that each link embedded within an Online Promotion takes the User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the Company Site functions with reasonable reliability and in a commercially reasonable manner throughout the Term. In particular, the Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement.",

The Company will attempt to adhere to the performance standards outlined in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Failure by the Company to meet these standards may be considered for further evaluation.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'will be responsible for ensuring' with 'will endeavor to ensure,' weakening the obligation. 'Appropriate area' is changed to 'an area,' making it less specific. 'Reasonable reliability and commercially reasonable manner' is replaced with 'generally functions in a manner that is deemed acceptable,' which is subjective. 'Comply with the performance standards' is weakened to 'attempt to adhere to the performance standards', and 'material breach' is downgraded to 'may be considered for further evaluation', creating ambiguity about the consequences of non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Creates unenforceable obligation due to vagueness and subjectivity. The original text established clear and enforceable obligations, whereas the revised version introduces uncertainty and weakens the standards expected of The Company. The term 'deemed acceptable' is vague. This perturbation removes the possibility of a breach of contract if standards are not met.",

The \"CNET Sales\" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of CNET Sales. The Company will make this information available in a manner which",

Such report will provide a general overview of the number of buyers, a summary of the behavior of those buyers, and estimated revenue from the Online Promotions, which may or may not account for sales tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations. CNET Sales calculations shall use a reasonable timeframe. The Company will consider technical procedures to enable reporting of CNET Sales, however the Company will only make available that information which",
                "explanation": "The change from 'will provide' to 'will, when feasible, provide' creates ambiguity around the obligation to provide a report. Changing 'indicating the aggregate number' to 'estimating the number' and 'general overview' introduces vagueness. The phrase 'may or may not account for' makes the accounting of sales tax, shipping costs, returns, and cancellations optional. Replacing a period of '4 hours from the referral' with 'a reasonable timeframe' is ambiguous and subjective. Changing 'easy and accurate reporting' to only 'consider technical procedures' removes requirements. Also changing 'make this information available in a manner which' with 'make available that information which' is vague.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - Requirements for Accurate Accounting: By introducing significant ambiguity into the reporting requirements, the modified text contradicts the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. Accurate accounting and reporting are often legally implied requirements to ensure transparency and allow for proper auditing and payment calculations. The new text creates an opportunity for inaccurate or incomplete reporting, potentially violating these implied obligations.",

This link could be a text phrase or series of text phrases promoting CNET's newsletters. CNET will provide entry forms and generally assist with newsletter operations.",
                "explanation": "Introducing 'within reason, attempt to place' significantly weakens the obligation to place the link. Adding 'so long as the inclusion does not interfere with normal newsletter operations' provides a broad and subjective exception to this obligation. Changing 'This link will be' to 'This link could be' makes the text phrases promoting CNET optional. Changing 'CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the production and sending of the newsletter' to 'CNET will provide entry forms and generally assist with newsletter operations' makes CNET's operation of the newsletter less firm.",

By making the placement of the link optional and contingent on subjective factors, the modified clause undermines the certainty of the reciprocal marketing arrangement, potentially rendering it unenforceable. Such changes go against the principle that parties should perform their contractual duties in good faith.",

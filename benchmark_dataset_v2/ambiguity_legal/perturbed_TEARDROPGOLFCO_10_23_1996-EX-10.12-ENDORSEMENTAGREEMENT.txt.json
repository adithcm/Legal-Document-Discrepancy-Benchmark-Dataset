                "changed_text": "Consolidated Artists shall encourage Ogle to use the Endorsed Product during the Contract Period and throughout the Contract Territory while playing competitive golf or participating in golf clinics and outings, to the extent reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to cause' to 'shall encourage' weakens the obligation. Adding 'to the extent reasonably practical' introduces subjective ambiguity, making enforcement difficult and potentially non-compliant, creating a loophole for non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "TPC agrees to provide Consolidated Artists and its representative, Advantage International Management, Inc. (\"Advantage\"), with a copy of all advertising and promotional materials which will use or show the Ogle Endorsement for their approval. Such promotional or advertising materials shall be delivered to Advantage at least fourteen (14) days prior to their release to the general public, and TPC agrees that the same shall not be released without the prior written approval of Advantage. Advantage agrees that it will not unreasonably disapprove or reject promotional or advertising materials hereunder, and that Advantage's failure to disapprove such materials within fourteen (14) days of receipt shall be deemed to be approval. In addition, TPC agrees to provide Consolidated Artists with complimentary duplicates of all promotional and/or advertising materials featuring Ogle or the Ogle Endorsement.",
                "changed_text": "TPC will endeavor to provide Consolidated Artists and its representative with advertising and promotional materials using the Ogle Endorsement for review. These materials should be delivered reasonably in advance of release. TPC will seek approval but may proceed if no response is received. Additionally, TPC will aim to supply complimentary duplicates.",
                "explanation": "The language is made more flexible by changing 'agrees to provide' to 'will endeavor to provide', 'shall be delivered at least fourteen days' to 'should be delivered reasonably in advance', and removing the strict requirement for prior written approval before release. This contradicts the purpose of the original clause intended to protect the athlete's image, and weakens the approval process.",

Consolidated Artists and Advantage, at Consolidated Artists' expense, shall have the right during the Contract Period and until two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement to inspect and make copies of the books and records of TPC insofar as they relate to the computation of royalty payments due and owing to Consolidated Artists hereunder.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'accurate and complete books and records' to 'records' weakens the standard. Limiting the inspection right to 'subject to TPC's reasonable availability and confidentiality concerns' introduces significant ambiguity and discretion, potentially hindering the ability to verify royalty payments. This undermines the purpose of audit rights.",

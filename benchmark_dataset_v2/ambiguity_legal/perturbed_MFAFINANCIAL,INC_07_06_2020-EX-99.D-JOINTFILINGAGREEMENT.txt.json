                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm their intent to jointly file the Statement on Schedule 13D and any further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing, provided they deem it necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'confirm the agreement...to the joint filing' with 'confirm their intent to jointly file...provided they deem it necessary' introduces ambiguity. The original text is a firm commitment, while the modified text makes the filing contingent on their own subjective assessment of necessity. This weakens the obligation to comply with SEC filing requirements.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement' to 'a number of counterparts if convenient, and each may be considered an original to the extent permissible, with the collective effect subject to further interpretation' creates ambiguity about the validity and enforceability of the agreement. Using 'if convenient', 'to the extent permissible', and 'subject to further interpretation' makes it unclear whether the counterparts are legally binding, particularly when combined. Original text makes it a single agreement no matter the number of counterpart",

It replaces a clear commitment to file with a conditional acknowledgment, dependent on the majority's subjective assessment and legal review. This undermines the mandatory nature of the filing requirement under Section 13(d).",

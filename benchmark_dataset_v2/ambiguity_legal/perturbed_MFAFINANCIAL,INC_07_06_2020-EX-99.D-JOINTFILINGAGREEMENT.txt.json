                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned will consider joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer. Inclusion of this Agreement as an Exhibit to such filing will be at the discretion of the filing parties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'hereby confirm the agreement...to the joint filing' with 'will consider joint filing' introduces ambiguity. The obligation to jointly file is no longer definitive. Also, making the inclusion of the agreement as an exhibit discretionary contradicts the explicit requirement of Rule 13d-1(k) to include the agreement as an exhibit.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may potentially be executed in counterparts. The parties will endeavor to treat all counterparts as parts of the same Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement' to 'may potentially be executed in counterparts. The parties will endeavor to treat all counterparts as parts of the same Agreement' creates uncertainty. Counterparts are standard practice to show that multiple parties are a part of the same agreement and weakening this would be contradictory. The term 'endeavor' introduces vagueness, suggesting only an effort rather than a guaranteed outcome which can create an issue of accountability and makes legal enforcement uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "IN GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE TERMS CONTAINED HEREIN, the undersigned may or may not choose to ratify this agreement as of July 6, 2020.",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'hereby execute this Agreement' to 'may or may not choose to ratify this agreement' introduces a significant ambiguity regarding whether the parties actually agree to be bound by the contract. The original language is a clear statement of intent to execute the agreement, whereas the modified language makes ratification optional. This creates a large issue of accountability. Ratifying implies acknowledgement only, and the date specified will not hold up in court.",

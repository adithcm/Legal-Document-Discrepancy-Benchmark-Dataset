                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of perceived noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards, the Licensee shall endeavor to address such concerns within a suitable timeframe.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'appropriate steps' to 'cure such noncompliance' within a defined timeframe, ensuring action. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'perceived noncompliance' and 'endeavor to address,' making the obligation discretionary and the timeframe vague, undermining the Licensor's control over brand quality. Also, changing the time frame to 'suitable' makes the duration undefined.",

                "original_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark will generally adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere regarding the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business, and will inform the Licensor of significant regulatory matters.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly requires full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and detailed notification to the Licensor. The modified text softens this requirement by using 'generally adhere to,' suggesting less than complete compliance. Furthermore, replacing the obligation to notify of 'any action' with 'significant regulatory matters' reduces transparency and allows the Licensee to decide what is 'significant,' potentially concealing critical compliance issues. This introduces ambiguity about the extent of compliance required and reported.",

The Licensee shall cooperate with the Licensor in the prosecution, defense or settlement of such actions, proceedings or claims.",

The Licensee will reasonably cooperate with the Licensor in such activities.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants the Licensor the 'exclusive right' to handle infringements. The modified version replaces 'exclusive right' with 'may, at its option,' significantly weakening the Licensor's control over trademark enforcement. Also, it changes the commitment of the Licensee from cooperating with prosecution of claims, to 'reasonably cooperate' which makes the level of cooperation vague.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be applied' to 'may be applied,' the obligation for Forty Niners SC to credit the deposit against the sponsorship fee is removed, creating ambiguity. This could potentially allow Forty Niners SC to retain the deposit without crediting it, contradicting general contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing, and potentially violating California's consumer protection laws if interpreted as an unfair business practice.",

                "changed_text": "Sponsor agrees that it will endeavor to avoid creating any trademark, logo or other intellectual property that is arguably similar to the Team Marks or that potentially indicates a relationship between Sponsor and the Team Companies, subject to Forty Niners SC's non-binding suggestions.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the restriction on creating similar trademarks by changing the firm commitment not to create similar marks to an agreement to ‘endeavor to avoid’ arguably similar marks. It also changes 'prior written approval' to 'non-binding suggestions'. This creates ambiguity about the sponsor's obligation, undermining trademark protection. Such ambiguity could violate federal trademark law (Lanham Act) because it weakens the ability to protect the Team Marks against potential infringement.",

                "explanation": "Changing the requirement to maintain specific insurance coverage to a requirement to 'use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain insurance coverage' introduces ambiguity. The change from 'shall furnish' to 'may furnish' weakens the obligation to provide proof of insurance, increasing risk. This contradicts general contract law principles that require clear and definite terms, and could lead to disputes about the adequacy of insurance coverage in case of an incident. California law requires parties to fulfill contractual obligations in good faith, which this change undermines.",

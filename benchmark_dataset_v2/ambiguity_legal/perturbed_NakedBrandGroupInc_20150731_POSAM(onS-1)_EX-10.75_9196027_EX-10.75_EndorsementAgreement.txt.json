Naked hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Wade Enterprises, Athlete, his agents, representatives and employees (referred to collectively as \"Wade Indemnities\") from and against any and all claims, actions, causes or action, damages, injuries, expenses, liabilities (joint and several), penalties fines, attorneys' fees, court costs, and any other expenses incurred by Wade Indemnities arising out of (1) breach by Naked of any of the terms, representations or warranties made by Naked in\nthis Agreement; or (2) Naked product liability or trademark patent or other\nproprietary right infringement; or (3) errors, omissions, fraudulent or negligent acts by Naked, its employees, agents or subcontractors in connection with (i) any advertising featuring Athlete; (ii) the performance of Naked's\nduties and obligations under this Agreement; (iii) the production, distribution, promotion, marketing and sales of products including related product packaging; and/or (iv) the operation and management of its production and distribution facilities, however caused. Naked shall not be obligated to indemnify Wade with respect to damages which are the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Wade.",
                "changed_text": "Naked shall endeavor to be responsible for liability arising out of production, distribution and sale of its product. Naked hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Wade Enterprises, Athlete, his agents, representatives and employees (referred to collectively as \"Wade Indemnities\") from and against claims, actions, causes or action, damages, injuries, expenses, liabilities (joint and several), penalties, attorneys' fees, and court costs incurred by Wade Indemnities arguably arising out of (1) Naked's potential breach of any of the terms, representations or warranties made by Naked in this Agreement; or (2) claims of Naked product liability or trademark patent or other proprietary right infringement; or (3) allegations of errors, omissions, fraudulent or putatively negligent acts by Naked, its employees, agents or subcontractors arguably in connection with (i) advertising featuring Athlete; (ii) the performance of Naked's duties and obligations under this Agreement; (iii) the production, distribution, promotion, marketing and sales of products including related product packaging; and/or (iv) the operation and management of its production and distribution facilities, with the extent of liability to be determined. Naked shall only be obligated to indemnify Wade with respect to damages which are the direct result of Wade's actions.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes 'shall be solely responsible' to 'shall endeavor to be responsible' which introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. Replacing 'arising out of' with 'arguably arising out of' and adding 'potential' before breach reduces the certainty of the indemnity obligation. The phrase 'with the extent of liability to be determined' introduces further ambiguity, and the change regarding indemnification obligation only applying to damages that are a 'direct result of Wade's actions' further narrows the scope of responsibility in a manner that may not be enforceable. This shift weakens the indemnity protection afforded to Wade and makes it more difficult to enforce, creating potential conflicts with standard contract law principles regarding indemnification which require clear and unambiguous terms.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'agree to consider indemnifying, defending and holding harmless,' the obligation becomes discretionary rather than mandatory. Adding terms like 'certain claims,' 'arguably incurred,' 'may be connected,' 'uncertain nature,' and 'potential' before breaches and misconduct introduces significant ambiguity and vagueness. The phrase 'subject to a reasonableness determination' further weakens the obligation, as reasonableness is a subjective standard. These changes make the indemnity provision highly uncertain and potentially unenforceable, conflicting with core principles of contract law that require clear and definite terms.",

Wade agrees to immediately remove all such materials in his Independent Promotions that Naked, in its sole and absolute discretion requests be removed.",

Naked may, at its option, review references to Naked in Independent Promotions before their release, but is not required to do so. If Naked requests removal of materials from Wade's Independent Promotions, Wade will consider the request.",
                "explanation": "The original text included stronger obligations such as 'generously and positively promote,' 'mutually agreed upon basis with reasonable frequency,' and 'immediately remove.' The modified text weakens these obligations by using vague terms like 'best efforts,' 'when he feels it is appropriate,' 'possibly on a sometimes basis,' 'potentially draw some attention,' and 'will consider the request.' The change from 'in its sole and absolute discretion, may preview' to 'at its option, review... but is not required to do so' makes Naked's review discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates ambiguity about the level of effort Wade must exert to promote the products and makes the agreement difficult to enforce due to the subjective nature of the obligations.",

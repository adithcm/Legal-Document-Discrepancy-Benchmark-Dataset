To facilitate this aim and in recognition of Logan's sensitivity to any adverse publicity with respect to the Driver and the Racing Team, SRP shall be responsible for the public image of the Driver and the Racing Team at all times, including but not limited to any statement by the Driver or the Team in connection with press conferences, media contact and any contact of the Driver or Team with the general public, whether at a race or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "SRP should endeavor to develop and maintain a reasonably positive public image for the Driver and the Team. SRP will consider Logan's sensitivity to adverse publicity, but ultimate responsibility for the public image of the Driver and the Racing Team will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, considering the circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear responsibility on SRP for maintaining a positive public image. The modified text weakens this obligation by using vague language like 'should endeavor' and 'reasonably positive,' and introducing subjectivity with 'assessed on a case-by-case basis, considering the circumstances.' This makes it difficult to enforce a specific standard of public image management.",

Such policies shall provide for at least fifteen (15) days' written notice to Logan's of the cancellation or substantial modification thereof. Such insurance will be supplemental coverage in excess of the Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) primary coverage provided to SRP and Logan's by the comprehensive liability policy of NMS.",
                "changed_text": "SRP shall obtain general liability insurance, aiming for a coverage level of approximately Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) per occurrence, regarding its activities. SRP will attempt to supply Logan's with proof of insurance when reasonably available. Notification of cancellation or modification of insurance will be provided if feasible. The exact nature of supplemental coverage will depend on policy availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific insurance amount and requires supplying proof of insurance and notice of changes. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'aiming for,' 'when reasonably available,' and 'if feasible,' making the insurance obligation less concrete and enforceable. The change from 'shall provide' to weaker phrases diminishes SRP's responsibility.",

Upon the execution and delivery of this agreement, it will be a valid and binding obligation of Logan's and SRP in accordance with its terms. Logan's and SRP further warrant they have not made, nor will make, any Agreement or commitment which would prevent or interfere in any way with the full performance of the obligations hereunder or the full enjoyment of the other party hereunder.",

They anticipate having the ability to provide the services outlined, subject to unforeseen circumstances. Upon execution, it is expected that this agreement will serve as a guideline for the obligations of both parties. Logan's and SRP represent that, to the best of their knowledge, they have not entered into agreements that would substantially interfere with the anticipated performance of their obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a strong warranty of power and authority to perform the agreement. The modified text weakens this warranty by adding subjective qualifiers like 'believe,' 'generally perform,' 'to the best of their understanding,' 'anticipate,' 'subject to unforeseen circumstances,' 'serve as a guideline,' and 'substantially interfere.' This creates ambiguity about the parties' commitment to fulfill their obligations.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall, during the course of its normal business, use reasonable endeavours subject to the terms of this Agreement to:\n\n     4.2.1 promote and market the experience and capabilities of the Parties in order to identify opportunities for W2E, such promotion and  marketing activities to be as agreed by the Parties from time to time;\n\n     4.2.2 identify, assess and communicate opportunities for W2E; and\n\n     4.2.3 undertake joint marketing initiatives and other marketing activities which are mutually beneficial for the business interests of both  Parties and as shall be agreed by the Parties from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may, during the course of its normal business, consider using endeavours subject to the terms of this Agreement to:\n\n     4.2.1 consider promoting and marketing the experience and capabilities of the Parties in order to identify opportunities for W2E, such promotion and  marketing activities to be at the Parties' discretion;\n\n     4.2.2 consider identifying, assessing and communicating opportunities for W2E; and\n\n     4.2.3 undertake joint marketing initiatives and other marketing activities which the parties feel are beneficial for the business interests of both  Parties and as shall be decided by the Parties from time to time.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall use reasonable endeavors' to 'may consider using endeavors' weakens the obligation to promote and market. Further, replacing 'as agreed by the Parties from time to time' with 'at the Parties' discretion' makes marketing efforts entirely optional. 'Which are mutually beneficial' to 'parties feel are beneficial' introduces a subjective element. This introduces ambiguity and weakens obligations.",

W2E shall have no obligations under this Clause where a W2E Customer elects for  whatever reason not to include a SHBV Boiler, a primary chamber, a secondary chamber or an economiser supplied by SHBV as part of the  Engineered Solution or directs W2E to utilise an alternative product.",
                "changed_text": "W2E acknowledges that it may explore the possibility of including a SHBV Boiler, and where applicable, a primary chamber, a secondary chamber and an economiser (in each case as supplied by SHBV as potentially contemplated by Clause 5.2), as a potential component of the Engineered Solution implemented for a W2E Customer within the Territory. W2E bears no strict obligations under this Clause where a W2E Customer might choose for subjective reasons to potentially exclude a SHBV Boiler, a primary chamber, a secondary chamber or an economiser potentially supplied by SHBV as a possible element of the Engineered Solution or suggests that W2E consider an alternative product.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees that it shall use reasonable endeavors to procure' with 'acknowledges that it may explore the possibility of including' reduces the commitment to use SHBV Boilers. Changing 'as contemplated by Clause 5.2' to 'as potentially contemplated by Clause 5.2' introduces doubt. Replacing 'elects for whatever reason' with 'might choose for subjective reasons' and 'directs W2E to utilize' to 'suggests that W2E consider' weakens the obligation. ",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may contemplate cooperating on possible public relations or publicity related exercises possibly pertaining to the Alliance, and should consider perhaps sharing with each other the general subject matter and potential scheduling of tentative press releases, possibly before such information is generally released. Absent a specific written agreement by the Parties (potentially regarding form and subject matter) or if perhaps expected by law, regulations, or a Stock Exchange, neither Party should generally be expected to make any public pronouncement (potentially comprising press material) about the general idea or possible terms of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall cooperate' to 'may contemplate cooperating', 'agree to share' to 'should consider perhaps sharing,' and 'coordinate the content and timing' to 'general subject matter and potential scheduling' all weaken the obligation to cooperate on publicity. Replacing 'Unless specifically agreed in writing' with 'Absent a specific written agreement' and 'neither Party may make any public announcement' with 'neither Party should generally be expected to make any public pronouncement' further introduces ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "Company agrees that no use whatsoever of Manning Identification nor any item used in connection with Manning Identification (including, without limitation, advertising) will be made hereunder unless and until the same has been approved by Pey Dirt. Pey Dirt agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved in writing within fourteen (14) days after receipt thereof. Pey Dirt agrees that any material submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds therefor.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees that best efforts will be made to obtain approval for any use of Manning Identification or any item used in connection with Manning Identification (including, without limitation, advertising). Pey Dirt will endeavor to review materials, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval and may provide feedback as needed. Pey Dirt will consider any disapproval reasonably, but is not obligated to provide specific grounds.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the approval process for using Manning's likeness. Replacing 'no use whatsoever... unless and until the same has been approved' with 'best efforts will be made to obtain approval' makes approval non-mandatory. Stating 'Pey Dirt will consider any disapproval reasonably, but is not obligated to provide specific grounds' removes the requirement for Pey Dirt to justify disapproval. This is ambiguous and could be interpreted as allowing arbitrary disapproval.",

                "changed_text": "Company agrees to attempt to indemnify and hold harmless Pey Dirt and Manning, or either of them, from expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs connected with advertising material furnished by, or on behalf of, Company, to the extent permissible by law.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'protect, indemnify and save harmless' with 'attempt to indemnify and hold harmless... to the extent permissible by law' significantly weakens the indemnification clause. The phrase 'attempt to' introduces uncertainty, and 'to the extent permissible by law' is overly broad and ambiguous, potentially allowing the company to avoid indemnification based on vague legal interpretations. The removal of '-2- all' also weakens the protection that Pey Dirt and Manning have. This makes the extent of the company's liability unclear and weakens the indemnification.",

                "original_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance with limits no less than $3,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Pey Dirt a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning as additional insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Pey Dirt at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to obtain general liability and product liability insurance with reasonable limits. Company may provide proof of insurance to Pey Dirt within a reasonable timeframe. It is desirable that Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning are listed as additional insured parties, and notification of policy changes should be attempted.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the insurance requirements. Replacing 'agrees to provide and maintain...with limits no less than $3,000,000' with 'will endeavor to obtain...with reasonable limits' makes the insurance obligation discretionary and the coverage amount vague. Changing 'within thirty (30) days' to 'within a reasonable timeframe' introduces ambiguity regarding the deadline for providing proof of insurance. The final sentence changes 'requiring that' to 'should be attempted,' making it non-mandatory to notify Pey Dirt of policy changes. This creates ambiguity about the actual insurance coverage and notification procedures, conflicting with standard business practices and potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Company agrees that no use whatsoever of Manning Identification nor any item used in connection with Manning Identification (including, without limitation, advertising) will be made hereunder unless and until the same has been approved by Pey Dirt. Pey Dirt agrees that any material, advertising or otherwise, submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved in writing within fourteen (14) days after receipt thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees that it will make reasonable efforts to obtain approval from Pey Dirt for the use of Manning Identification and any item used in connection with Manning Identification (including, without limitation, advertising). Pey Dirt will consider submitted materials, advertising or otherwise, for approval as provided herein, and approval may be inferred if not explicitly disapproved.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly requires explicit approval from Pey Dirt for using Manning Identification. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'no use whatsoever... unless and until the same has been approved' with 'reasonable efforts to obtain approval,' weakening the requirement. It also replaces the explicit approval requirement with 'approval may be inferred if not explicitly disapproved', making approval implicit rather than explicit.",
                "contradicted_law": "Right of Publicity Laws in Tennessee (and generally applicable contract law principles requiring clear agreement). Tennessee law recognizes the right of publicity, requiring explicit consent for commercial use of someone's likeness. The modified clause introduces ambiguity about what constitutes consent.",

                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to protect, indemnify, and save harmless Pey Dirt and Manning, or either of them, from expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments, and costs somehow related to advertising material furnished by, or on behalf of, Company.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the indemnity obligation. 'Agrees to protect, indemnify and save harmless' is replaced with 'will endeavor to protect, indemnify, and save harmless', making the obligation less definitive. 'Any and all expenses... arising out of, or in any way connected with' is replaced with 'expenses...somehow related to', narrowing the scope of indemnity and introducing ambiguity about the degree of connection required.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tennessee contract law requires clear and unambiguous language in indemnity agreements. 'Endeavor' and 'somehow related' are vague terms that would likely render the indemnity provision unenforceable or subject to lengthy litigation.",

The modification changes the text to 'will attempt to supply' and replaces 'such amounts as Pey Dirt and/or its agent may reasonably request' with 'some amount of Endorsed Products if requested.' The modified text is weaker in obligation and more ambiguous on the quantity to supply.",
                "contradicted_law": "Tennessee contract law, specifically regarding the requirement for definite and certain terms in a contract. The original provision, while containing 'reasonably request,' still provides a more concrete obligation than the modified provision, which essentially allows the company to supply a negligible amount, rendering the obligation illusory.",

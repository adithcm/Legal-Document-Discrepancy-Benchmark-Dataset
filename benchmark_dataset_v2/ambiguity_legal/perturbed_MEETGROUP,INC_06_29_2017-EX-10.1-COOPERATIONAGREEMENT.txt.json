                "original_text": "The Company agrees that, concurrent with the appointment of the New Directors to the Board, the Board shall take such action as is necessary such that each of the New Directors is appointed to at least one (1) of the three (3) standing committees of the Board that the Company is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards; provided that, with respect to each such committee appointment, the New Director is and continues to remain eligible to serve as a member of such committee pursuant to applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ that are applicable to the composition of such committee.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may consider, at its discretion, appointing the New Directors to a committee of the Board, as it deems reasonably practical; provided that the New Director is ostensibly eligible to serve, considering vaguely applicable laws and NASDAQ guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity regarding the company's obligation to appoint new directors to board committees. Replacing 'shall take such action as is necessary such that each of the New Directors is appointed' with 'may consider, at its discretion' weakens the commitment. The terms 'reasonably practical' and 'ostensibly eligible' introduce subjective criteria, making it difficult to enforce this provision. This conflicts with NASDAQ listing standards, which require specific committee structures and independent director representation.",

(\"ISS\") issues a recommendation with respect to any matter (other than with respect to the election of nominees as directors to the Board or the removal of directors from the Board) that is different from the recommendation of the Board, each of the Investors shall have the right to vote on the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form in accordance with the ISS recommendation (the \"Other Voting Recommendation\"); and (C) not execute any proxy card or voting instruction form in respect of such stockholders' meeting other than the proxy card and related voting instruction form being solicited by or on behalf of the Company or the Board.",
                "changed_text": "At each annual and special meeting of stockholders, each of the Investors will endeavor to (A) ensure a reasonable attempt is made to have shares present for quorum; (B) generally vote in favor of Board nominees, unless circumstances suggest otherwise; and (C) mostly refrain from using other proxy cards, except where practically necessary.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the voting agreement. Replacing 'agrees to' with 'will endeavor to' makes the voting obligation less mandatory. The phrases 'reasonable attempt,' 'unless circumstances suggest otherwise,' and 'mostly refrain' introduce subjective criteria, making it difficult to enforce the agreement to vote with the Board's recommendations. This creates ambiguity and allows the investor to deviate from their initial commitment, contrary to the original intention and potentially violating the duty of good faith.",

                "original_text": "Each Investor agrees that, from the date of this Agreement until the expiration of the Standstill Period (as defined below), without the prior written consent of a majority of the Board specifically expressed in a written resolution, neither it nor any of its Related Persons (as defined herein) will, and it will cause each of its Related Persons not to, directly or indirectly, alone or with others, in any manner: (i) propose or publicly announce or otherwise publicly disclose an intent to propose or enter into or agree to enter into, singly or with any other person, directly or indirectly, (x) any form of business combination or acquisition or other transaction relating to a material amount of assets or securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (y) any form of restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (z) any form of tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock, whether or not such transaction involves a change of control of the Company;",
                "changed_text": "Each Investor will generally refrain, insofar as is reasonably practical, from directly proposing any business combination or acquisition without explicit written consent from the Board; however, this should not be interpreted as a complete bar on exploring potential opportunities.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the standstill provision, which restricts the investor's ability to propose certain transactions. Replacing the strict prohibition with 'will generally refrain, insofar as is reasonably practical' introduces a high level of ambiguity. The phrase 'reasonably practical' is subjective and open to interpretation, creating a loophole. The addition of 'this should not be interpreted as a complete bar on exploring potential opportunities' further undermines the restriction, allowing the investor to potentially circumvent the standstill agreement, conflicting with the legally binding intent of such provisions. This could allow actions that destabilize the company during the standstill period.",

                "original_text": "The Company agrees that, concurrent with the appointment of the New Directors to the Board, the Board shall take such action as is necessary such that each of the New Directors is appointed to at least one (1) of the three (3) standing committees of the Board that the Company is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards; provided that, with respect to each such committee appointment, the New Director is and continues to remain eligible to serve as a member of such committee pursuant to applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ that are applicable to the composition of such committee.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will endeavor to appoint the New Directors to a committee, as it deems feasible. The Company will consider the NASDAQ listing standards when making committee appointments, if practical.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces 'shall take such action as is necessary' with 'will endeavor to appoint,' weakening the obligation. 'As it deems feasible' introduces subjective criteria for committee appointments. Replacing 'is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards' with 'will consider the NASDAQ listing standards when making committee appointments, if practical' provides room for non-compliance. This introduces ambiguity regarding compliance with NASDAQ requirements for committee composition, potentially violating those standards which require specific committees and independent directors. This conflicts with the requirements of NASDAQ, which requires that listed companies maintain specific committees and that those committees meet certain requirements.",

('ISS') issues a recommendation with respect to any matter (other than with respect to the election of nominees as directors to the Board or the removal of directors from the Board) that is different from the recommendation of the Board, each of the Investors shall have the right to vote on the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form in accordance with the ISS recommendation (the 'Other Voting Recommendation'); and (C) not execute any proxy card or voting instruction form in respect of such stockholders' meeting other than the proxy card and related voting instruction form being solicited by or on behalf of the Company or the Board.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'agrees to' is replaced by 'should endeavor to', making the voting commitment non-binding. 'Absent unusual circumstances' adds a broad exception to voting in favor of the Board's nominees, providing an easy opt-out. 'Typically use the Company’s proxy card' is vague. The original text provided clear direction and obligations, whereas the new text makes compliance voluntary. Under Delaware law, shareholders have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the corporation when exerting control. By making the voting agreement non-binding, the provision might allow investors to take actions that are not aligned with the company's best interests, thus potentially violating their duties under Delaware corporate law. Shareholders agreements for voting on specific items require specific compliance.",

(iii) acquire, offer or propose to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, whether by purchase, tender or exchange offer, through the acquisition of control of another person, by joining a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group (including any group of persons that would be treated as a single 'person' under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), through swap or hedging transactions or otherwise, any additional securities (including common and preferred equity interests and debt that is convertible into any equity interests) of the Company or any rights decoupled from the underlying securities of the Company, that would result, or could result, in the Investor Group owning, in the aggregate (amongst all of the Investors and any Affiliate or Associate thereof), in excess of 10% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding;",

The determination of what constitutes a substantial increase will be left to the Investor’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The term 'will generally not acquire' weakens the restriction on acquiring additional securities. The phrase 'unless unforeseen circumstances arise' provides a broad and subjective exception. 'The determination of what constitutes a substantial increase will be left to the Investor’s discretion' introduces more subjectivity and allows investors to potentially increase their ownership significantly, thereby undermining the purpose of the standstill provision and circumventing the regulations enforced by the SEC related to disclosure and control of company stock.",

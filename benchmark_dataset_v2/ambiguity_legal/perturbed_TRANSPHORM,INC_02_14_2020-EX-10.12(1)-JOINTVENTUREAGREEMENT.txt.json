                "original_text": "Each Party will indemnify the Company and hold it harmless for, from and against any claims, demands, costs or expenses arising out of or relating to such consolidated financial statements, provided that such indemnity shall not apply to claims, demands, costs or expenses to the extent they are related to the Company's financial statements provided to such Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will endeavor to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless for claims, demands, costs or expenses arising out of or relating to such consolidated financial statements, provided that such indemnity shall not necessarily apply to claims, demands, costs or expenses to the extent they are related to the Company's financial statements provided to such Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear indemnification obligation. The modified version uses 'endeavor to indemnify,' weakening the obligation. Additionally, changing 'shall not apply' to 'shall not necessarily apply' makes the exclusion ambiguous and discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clear and definite obligations, particularly regarding indemnification. The ambiguity introduced makes it difficult to enforce the indemnification clause.",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the GaN Equipment should generally be used in GaN wafer processing, and its use in silicon wafer processing for AFSL's or FSL's current products should be minimized.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a strict restriction on the use of GaN equipment. The modified version uses 'should generally be used' and 'should be minimized,' which are not strict directives and allow for interpretation, making the obligation ambiguous and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principle of specific performance, which requires precise and unambiguous obligations to be enforced effectively. The modified language introduces subjectivity and makes enforcement challenging.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that representatives are nonvoting observers. The revised text adds terms like 'can occasionally attend,' and 'generally being,' which adds ambiguity as to the frequency and right to attend, thereby weakening the clarity of their role.",
                "contradicted_law": "Corporate governance norms, specifically the establishment of roles and responsibilities of observers on a Board. The ambiguity now causes their position to be discretionary, rather than clearly defined.",

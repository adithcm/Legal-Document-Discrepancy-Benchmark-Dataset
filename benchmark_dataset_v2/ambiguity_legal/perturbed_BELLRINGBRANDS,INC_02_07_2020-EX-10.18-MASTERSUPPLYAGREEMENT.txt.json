                "original_text": "Supplier will comply with all applicable environmental laws and reporting obligations, maintain all required permits, and strive to responsibly manage the impacts of their operations on the environment.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will endeavor to comply with environmental laws and reporting obligations, maintain permits as reasonably practical, and consider responsibly managing the impacts of their operations on the environment.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation from strict compliance to 'endeavor to comply' and makes permit maintenance 'as reasonably practical,' allowing for potential non-compliance with environmental regulations. The phrase 'consider responsibly managing' introduces subjectivity into the environmental impact management, potentially leading to inadequate measures.",
                "contradicted_law": "Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) - These laws require strict adherence to environmental standards and permitting processes.",

                "changed_text": "Supplier will aim to provide reasonably clean, safe and healthy work environments; acknowledge the concept of employees' free association and collective bargaining; generally adhere to wage and hour laws; and make efforts to verify the employment eligibility of its employees.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the obligations concerning worker safety, rights, wage laws, and employment verification. Changing 'shall provide' to 'will aim to provide reasonably' introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of cleanliness, safety, and health. Replacing 'recognize and respect the right' with 'acknowledge the concept of' dilutes the commitment to employees' rights. Changing 'comply with all applicable wage and hour laws' to 'generally adhere to' creates a loophole for non-compliance. The phrase 'make efforts to verify' provides no guarantee that employment eligibility will be properly verified.",

                "original_text": "Supplier will not employ, use or otherwise benefit from involuntary labor, forced labor, or labor that results from slavery or human trafficking. Supplier hereby certifies that: (i) it is in compliance with this paragraph; and (ii) all materials incorporated into its products comply with all applicable laws addressing slavery, human trafficking and other forms of forced labor.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will strive to avoid employing, using, or otherwise benefiting from involuntary labor, forced labor, or labor that results from slavery or human trafficking. Supplier believes that: (i) it is generally in compliance with this paragraph; and (ii) to the best of its knowledge, the materials incorporated into its products comply with most applicable laws addressing slavery, human trafficking and other forms of forced labor.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will not employ' to 'will strive to avoid employing,' and 'it is in compliance' to 'it is generally in compliance,' the supplier no longer provides a guarantee against using forced labor. The change from 'all materials comply' to 'to the best of its knowledge, the materials incorporated into its products comply with most applicable laws' weakens the assurance and introduces a disclaimer about their knowledge and the extent of compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), California Transparency in Supply Chains Act - These laws mandate strict prohibition of forced labor and require companies to ensure their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.",

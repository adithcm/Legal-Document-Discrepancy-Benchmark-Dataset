                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Donated amounts may be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter at some point during each quarter of the Agreement for its term.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'will be allocated and dispersed' and 'on a quarterly basis thereafter' implying a mandatory and timely distribution. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may be allocated and dispersed' which makes the donation discretionary, and 'at some point during each quarter' which gives no specific time frame, potentially delaying or avoiding payments. This creates a legal ambiguity regarding the obligation and timing of the donation.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding charitable donations requires clear and timely disbursement of funds as agreed upon. This ambiguity could lead to non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "** The Company will endeavor to provide to the NFLA-NC the sales report of the Company's Licensed Products if reasonably available.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses 'will provide upon request,' indicating a firm commitment to furnish quarterly sales reports. The modified text changes this to 'will endeavor to provide...if reasonably available,' significantly weakening the obligation. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt without guarantee of success, and 'if reasonably available' introduces a subjective criterion allowing the company to avoid providing the report if it deems doing so unreasonable. This creates ambiguity around the provision of sales data.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires transparency and accurate reporting for charitable contributions. This ambiguity undermines the ability of NFLA-NC to verify donation amounts, thus conflicting with regulations regarding proper accounting for charitable funds.",

                "changed_text": "Amendments to this Agreement are preferred to be signed by all parties to this Agreement where practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that all amendments 'must be signed by all parties,' creating a clear and enforceable requirement for unanimous agreement on any changes. The modified text states that amendments are 'preferred to be signed by all parties where practical.' This weakens the obligation, suggesting that amendments can be valid even without all signatures if it's deemed impractical to obtain them. The term 'where practical' introduces a subjective element, making it unclear under what circumstances an amendment would be valid without unanimous consent.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles generally require mutual consent for contract modifications. Introducing ambiguity about the necessity of all parties' signatures potentially undermines the validity and enforceability of future amendments under both California and Nevada law (given the parties involved).",

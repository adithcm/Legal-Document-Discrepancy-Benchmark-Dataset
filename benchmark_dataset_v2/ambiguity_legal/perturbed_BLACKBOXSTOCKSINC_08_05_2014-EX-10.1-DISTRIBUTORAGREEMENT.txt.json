                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to market, distribute, and promote the Brand and Products in the Territory at its own discretion.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'commercially reasonable efforts' with 'endeavor' and 'at its own cost' with 'at its own discretion' significantly weakens the obligation on the distributor to actively market and promote the products. 'Endeavor' is a vague term that doesn't specify a concrete level of effort. 'At its own discretion' implies the distributor can choose whether or not to spend money on marketing, which undermines the purpose of the distribution agreement.",

                "original_text": "Company warrants that Distributor shall acquire Products purchased hereunder free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except for Company's purchase money security interest defined in Section 1.03, above. Company further warrants all Products to be free from defects in material or workmanship under normal use and service for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery. Any defects must be replaced by the Company within sixty (60) days within this scope of the warranty and all charges for labor and material, will be borne by Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company warrants that Distributor shall acquire Products purchased hereunder subject to existing liens and encumbrances. Company also warrants Products to be mostly free from significant defects in material or workmanship under normal use and service; issues will be assessed on a case by case basis. Any potential replacements by the Company may be arranged when convenient.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'free and clear of all liens' to 'subject to existing liens' completely reverses the obligation. Introducing the phrase 'mostly free from significant defects' and stating that issues 'will be assessed on a case by case basis' creates substantial ambiguity and allows the company to avoid warranty claims. Furthermore, replacing 'Any defects must be replaced by the Company within sixty (60) days within this scope of the warranty and all charges for labor and material, will be borne by Company.' with 'Any potential replacements by the Company may be arranged when convenient.' completely removes the explicit obligation to replace defective products.",

                "original_text": "The Distributor agrees to hold the Company free and harmless from any and all claims, damages, and expenses of every kind or nature whatsoever (a) arising from acts of the Distributor; (b) as a direct or indirect consequence of termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; or (c) arising from acts of third parties in relation to Products sold to the Distributor under this Agreement, including, but not limited to execution of liens and security interests by third parties with respect to any such Products.",
                "changed_text": "The Distributor agrees to consider holding the Company harmless from certain claims, damages, and expenses that might be somewhat related to: (a) specific acts of gross negligence by the Distributor; (b) a possible consequence of termination of this Agreement; or (c) the actions of third parties under specific circumstances.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces ambiguity into the indemnification clause. Replacing 'agrees to hold the Company free and harmless' with 'agrees to consider holding the Company harmless' makes the obligation discretionary. The addition of words like 'certain,' 'might be somewhat related to,' 'specific acts of gross negligence,' 'possible consequence,' and 'under specific circumstances' limits the scope of the indemnity and creates multiple interpretations, making it difficult to enforce.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor shall endeavor to market, distribute and promote the Brand and Products in the Territory at its own discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'endeavor' and 'at its own discretion' weakens the obligation to market and distribute the product. 'Endeavor' is less stringent than 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts', and 'at its own discretion' introduces subjectivity, making it difficult to enforce a specific level of marketing effort. This contradicts general contract law principles that require good faith and reasonable efforts in fulfilling contractual obligations. It also goes against established business practices.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to ship units to Distributor as close as possible to the delivery schedule' to 'attempt to ship units to Distributor around the estimated delivery schedule' significantly weakens the obligation. The addition of 'No specific delivery timeframe can be guaranteed' introduces further ambiguity and provides an easy way for the Company to avoid any liability for late deliveries. This could potentially violate the UCC provisions related to reasonable time for delivery, depending on the circumstances and industry standards. Texas Business and Commerce Code governs the sale of goods and requires reasonable standards of commercial dealing.",

Any defects must be replaced by the Company within sixty (60) days within this scope of the warranty and all charges for labor and material, will be borne by Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company provides a limited warranty that Products are generally free from significant defects in material or major workmanship issues under typical use for approximately ninety (90) days from delivery, subject to Company discretion. Replacement of defective items will be considered and may be offered.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty provides a clear 90-day warranty against defects, with a requirement for replacement within 60 days. The modified version introduces several ambiguities: 'generally free from significant defects' weakens the standard of quality, 'major workmanship issues' adds subjectivity, 'typical use' is vague, 'approximately ninety (90) days' is less precise, 'subject to Company discretion' makes the warranty conditional, and 'Replacement...may be offered' makes the remedy uncertain. This weakens the warranty to the point of being unenforceable and is likely violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act if misleading about the actual warranty coverage.",

                "changed_text": "SHPS shall endeavor to provide the Care Management Services to the Clients, considering the terms of the Client Agreements.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall provide' with 'shall endeavor to provide' weakens the obligation, making it less mandatory. The addition of 'considering the terms' instead of 'in accordance with the terms' makes adherence to the Client Agreements discretionary. This can lead to disputes over the level of service provided and potential non-compliance.",

                "changed_text": "For the purpose of determining the fees payable to SHPS under this Agreement, HPS may maintain records of Care Management Revenues by Client as it deems necessary. SHPS may request to examine such records, subject to HPS's approval.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall preserve adequate records' to 'may maintain records...as it deems necessary' makes record-keeping optional. Replacing 'shall have the right' with 'may request...subject to HPS's approval' gives HPS discretionary control over SHPS's audit rights, creating ambiguity. This weakens SHPS's ability to verify payments, which contradicts fundamental principles of contract law regarding transparency and audit trails.",

                "changed_text": "SHPS and HPS each agree to make commercially reasonable efforts to keep information confidential, using it primarily for purposes of this Agreement, and to avoid disclosing such information without undue cause.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'strict confidence' with 'commercially reasonable efforts,' weakening the confidentiality requirement. The vague term 'undue cause' introduces ambiguity regarding permitted disclosures, conflicting with the original intent of stringent confidentiality. This could violate privacy laws such as HIPAA if Care Management Services involve protected health information.",

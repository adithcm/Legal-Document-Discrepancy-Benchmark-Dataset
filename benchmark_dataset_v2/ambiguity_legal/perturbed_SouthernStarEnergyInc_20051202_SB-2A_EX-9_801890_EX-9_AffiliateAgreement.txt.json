                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall' with 'should make reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation discretionary rather than mandatory.

Affiliate and Software Publisher may, if they choose, object to such changes. If no objection is received, the Participant may be deemed to have accepted the changes.",
                "explanation": "Removing the explicit requirement to maintain the current version of the terms and conditions for viewing as a hyperlink and watering down the email announcement to 'endeavor' creates ambiguity about how and when affiliates will be informed of changes. Changing 'within 14 days ... may object' to 'if they choose, object' eliminates the mandatory timeline to receive notice, which severely degrades the affiliates' ability to stay in compliance. Replacing 'is deemed' with 'may be deemed' weakens the acceptance process, leaving its definitiveness open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "Weakening the guarantees by replacing 'guarantees' with 'represents', 'will' with 'will attempt' and 'will ideally not contain' significantly lowers the standard of compliance. Replacing 'according to the provisions and instructions' with 'consistent with the general spirit of' grants more discretion to the affiliate. Adding 'patently offensive' creates a subjective threshold for unsuitable content. Replacing 'will not knowingly infringe' with 'will try not to send' provides less accountability.",

                "changed_text": "(b) The Company hereby agrees that it will generally avoid making acquisitions during the Cooperation Period, except for what it considers to be ordinary course acquisitions individually under approximately $10 million (with an overall target of not exceeding $30 million in the aggregate) or acquisitions that the JANA Nominees have suggested.",
                "explanation": "The term 'generally avoid' weakens the commitment, and 'what it considers to be' introduces subjectivity. 'Approximately' makes the dollar amount vague, and 'suggested' lowers the bar for JANA Nominees' involvement. This introduces ambiguity around the company's obligation to refrain from acquisitions.",

                "changed_text": "(a) JANA agrees that, from the date of this Agreement until the earliest of (i) the date that is thirty (30) calendar days prior to any applicable deadline by which a shareholder must give notice to the Company of its intention to nominate a director for election at or bring other business before the 2015 Annual Meeting under the Company's By­Laws and (ii) any alleged material breach of this Agreement by the Company (provided that the Company shall have what is considered to be a reasonable time following written notice from JANA of material breach to remedy such alleged material breach if reasonably capable of remedy) (such period, the \"Cooperation Period\"), neither it nor any of its Affiliates or Associates will in any manner, directly or indirectly, make, or cause to be made, or in any way encourage any other person to make or cause to be made, any statement or announcement that arguably relates to and possibly constitutes what some might consider to be an ad hominem attack on, or arguably relates to and otherwise possibly disparages, the Company, any of its officers or directors or any person who has served as an officer or director of the Company, including: (i) in any document or report filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or any other governmental agency, (ii) in any press release or other publicly available format or (iii) to any journalist or member of the media (including without limitation, in a television, radio, newspaper or magazine interview), or otherwise; provided, that if the Company makes any material announcement prior to the March Board Meeting, JANA will be permitted to make statements that reflect JANA's view.",
                "explanation": "The words 'alleged', 'what is considered to be a reasonable time', 'arguably', 'possibly', and 'what some might consider to be' all introduce subjectivity and ambiguity into what constitutes a breach or disparagement. It makes it much harder to enforce the non-disparagement clause.",

                "changed_text": "(d) During the Cooperation Period, JANA shall endeavor to cause a substantial portion of the shares of the Company's capital stock (\"Shares\") beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by it, or by any of its Affiliates or Associates (including without limitation all Shares beneficially owned as of the respective record dates for the 2014 Annual Meeting and as of the record dates for any special meeting of shareholders) over which it exercises or has voting authority, to be present for quorum purposes and to be voted, at such meetings or at any adjournments or postponements thereof, generally in favor of the current members of the Board (including the JANA Nominees) that will be up for election at such meetings, and shall try not to submit any proposal for consideration at, or bring any other business before, the 2014 Annual Meeting or initiate, encourage or participate substantially in any \"withhold\" or similar campaign with respect to the election of directors at the 2014 Annual Meeting and shall attempt not to permit any of its Affiliates or Associates to do any of the foregoing or publicly or privately strongly encourage or support any other stockholder to take any such actions.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'endeavor to cause', 'substantial portion', 'generally in favor of', 'try not to submit', 'participate substantially', and 'attempt not to permit' significantly weaken the obligation to vote shares in a specific manner and refrain from certain actions. The changes are subtle enough to seem reasonable but create significant loopholes. 'Strongly encourage' is added to reduce the weight of the contract to be considered a best effort.",

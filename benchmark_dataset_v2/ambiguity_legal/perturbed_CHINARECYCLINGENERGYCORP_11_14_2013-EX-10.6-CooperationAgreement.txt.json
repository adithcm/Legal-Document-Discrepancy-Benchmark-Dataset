                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party A shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance and management of the recycling project. Party A shall charge Party B energy saving service fee according to the income from CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "changed_text": "Party A will endeavor to be responsible for the operation, maintenance, and management of the recycling project. Party A may charge Party B an energy saving service fee based on the perceived income from the CDQ waste heat power generation station.",
                "explanation": "The modifications weaken Party A's obligation. Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'will endeavor to be' introduces uncertainty. 'Shall charge' becomes 'may charge based on the perceived income,' which is subjective and lacks a concrete, enforceable standard for determining the fee, potentially leading to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 8, which requires contracts to be legally binding and enforceable.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Party B shall pay Party A the energy saving service fee after the construction of CDQ system and CDQ waste heat power generation system are completed (upon passing evaluation of the ability of connection to the grid for power generation).",
                "changed_text": "Party B should consider paying Party A a mutually agreed upon energy saving service fee some time after the CDQ system and CDQ waste heat power generation system appear to be completed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall pay' with 'should consider paying' introduces ambiguity and makes the payment obligation non-mandatory. Removing the specific completion and evaluation criteria introduces more vagueness and makes the payment obligation much more difficult to enforce because there is no precise standard for determining when the payment obligation is triggered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 62, which requires clarity on the terms of payment and timelines.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The CDQ and CDQ power generation systems shall comply with the national environmental protection standards. If the environment is polluted during the operation of the power plant, Party A shall bear the liability.",
                "changed_text": "Party A will strive for the CDQ and CDQ power generation systems to generally align with what it understands to be the national environmental protection standards. If pollution arguably occurs during the operation of the power plant, Party A may address the alleged liability as it sees fit.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens the obligation to comply with environmental standards. Replacing 'shall comply' with 'will strive for...to generally align' introduces a weaker, less definite commitment. The replacement of 'shall bear the liability' with 'may address the alleged liability as it sees fit' makes the liability discretionary, potentially allowing Party A to avoid responsibility for environmental damage. Furthermore, the word \"arguably\" makes it difficult to prove pollution occurred, as it adds a high burden for proof and it contradicts the strict regulations under Chinese Environmental Protection Law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, which mandates strict compliance with environmental standards and assigns clear liability for pollution.",

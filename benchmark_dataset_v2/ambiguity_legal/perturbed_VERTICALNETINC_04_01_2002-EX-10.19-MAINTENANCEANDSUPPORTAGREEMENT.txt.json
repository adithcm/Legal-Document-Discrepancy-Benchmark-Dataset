                "original_text": "VNE shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Converge with an initial response to and status reports for all Problems reported by Converge, and to resolve all Problems identified, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE shall have no further obligation to respond to or attempt to diagnose or resolve a Problem once it is determined not to be attributable to Errors.",
                "changed_text": "VNE shall endeavor to provide an initial response and status reports for Problems reported by Converge, and may attempt to resolve Problems identified, subject to the guidelines in Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE's obligation to address a Problem will cease once it is possibly not attributable to Errors.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to respond to and resolve problems. Replacing 'shall use its reasonable best efforts' with 'shall endeavor' makes the obligation less stringent. Changing 'in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B' to 'subject to the guidelines in Exhibit B' reduces the binding nature of the exhibit. Furthermore, stating that VNE's obligation ceases when a problem is 'possibly not attributable to Errors' allows VNE to cease efforts prematurely, even if the error source is still reasonably suspected.",

                "original_text": "Converge agrees to install in the recommend environments all Maintenance Updates within a reasonable time following the date they are provided by VNE, taking into consideration any testing and customization required by Converge (the parties expect that the time for such installation 5 generally will not exceed 90 days). Should Converge find one or more material deficiencies in any Maintenance Update, Converge shall promptly identify such deficiencies to VNE in reasonable detail.",
                "changed_text": "Converge should consider installing Maintenance Updates within a flexible timeframe after VNE provides them, bearing in mind Converge's testing and customization needs. (the parties anticipate installation might require some time). If Converge observes any deficiencies in a Maintenance Update, Converge may inform VNE.",
                "explanation": "This section originally placed an obligation on Converge to install updates within a reasonable time, with a 90-day expectation. The modified version uses weaker language ('should consider,' 'flexible timeframe,' 'anticipate might require some time') and makes the reporting of deficiencies optional ('may inform'), thus creating ambiguity and lessening the enforceability of these obligations.",

                "original_text": "VNE will maintain procedures and systems designed to ensure that Problem Reports and Support Requests submitted by Converge are properly logged and tracked. In addition, VNE will provide to Converge a weekly status log of Problem Reports and Support Requests currently being tracked. Such report shall identify, as appropriate, each Problem Report or Support Request as submitted by Converge, the Severity Level for each identified Problem, the date and time each Problem Report or Support Request was received by VNE, an assessment of the Problem Report or Support Request and an action plan detailing the proposed method of resolution, and an estimated time schedule for delivery of any necessary Error corrections.",
                "changed_text": "VNE may maintain procedures and systems to log and track Problem Reports and Support Requests. VNE may provide a status log of these items periodically. Such reports might include the Problem Report, Severity Level, and time of receipt, where feasible. VNE will try to give an outline of the resolution and time if possible.",
                "explanation": "The original text created an explicit obligation to maintain logging and tracking procedures and to provide a detailed weekly status log. The modified text replaces 'will maintain' with 'may maintain,' making the maintenance of these procedures optional. It also replaces 'will provide' with 'may provide' and weakens the content of the report to 'might include,' and 'if possible,' reducing the definiteness of the information provided and creating an ambiguous level of effort.",

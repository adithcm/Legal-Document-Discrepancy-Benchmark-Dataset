                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "VNE shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Converge with an initial response to and status reports for all Problems reported by Converge, and to resolve all Problems identified, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE shall have no further obligation to respond to or attempt to diagnose or resolve a Problem once it is determined not to be attributable to Errors. VNE will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty, the parties will assume a higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.",
                "changed_text": "VNE shall endeavor to provide Converge with an initial response and occasional status updates for Problems reported by Converge, and will consider resolving identified Problems, subject to VNE's resource availability. VNE will aim to review Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the indicated Severity Level. In cases of uncertainty, the parties may discuss the Severity Level. If VNE addresses a Problem at a higher Severity Level than ultimately determined, or if the Problem is found not to be an Error, the reimbursement for VNE's expenses will be subject to further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The modified text weakens VNE's obligation to respond to and resolve problems by replacing 'shall use its reasonable best efforts' with 'shall endeavor' and 'will consider'. The commitment to resolving problems in accordance with Exhibit B is undermined by the condition of 'subject to VNE's resource availability'. The review of Problem Severity Levels becomes discretionary ('aim to review', 'may discuss'), and the reimbursement obligation becomes subject to negotiation, creating uncertainty and potentially conflicting with typical service level agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite obligations, potentially conflicting with Pennsylvania law regarding contract interpretation and enforcement. Specific performance may be difficult to enforce with the ambiguous language.",

                "original_text": "Converge agrees to install in the recommend environments all Maintenance Updates within a reasonable time following the date they are provided by VNE, taking into consideration any testing and customization required by Converge (the parties expect that the time for such installation generally will not exceed 90 days). Should Converge find one or more material deficiencies in any Maintenance Update, Converge shall promptly identify such deficiencies to VNE in reasonable detail.",
                "changed_text": "Converge will consider installing Maintenance Updates in suitable environments following their provision by VNE, subject to Converge's discretion regarding testing and customization. The parties anticipate that installation should occur in a timely manner. If Converge identifies deficiencies, it may inform VNE.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'agrees to install' with 'will consider installing', making the installation of updates optional rather than mandatory. The phrase 'within a reasonable time' is replaced with 'in a timely manner,' which is more ambiguous. The obligation to 'promptly identify such deficiencies' is softened to 'it may inform VNE'. This creates uncertainty about Converge's commitment to maintaining updated systems, which could affect system stability and security.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with standards of reasonable care in maintaining software systems, which, while not codified in specific laws, are implied in many software licensing agreements and could lead to disputes over liability for security breaches or system failures.",

                "original_text": "VNE will transfer to Converge all Maintenance Updates, and any associated Documentation, by remote telecommunications from the VNE place of business, to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. If any such Maintenance Update and/or associated Documentation cannot be delivered via remote telecommunications to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, such Maintenance Update and/or Documentation will be installed by VNE on a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. Converge will not obtain title or possession of any tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the delivery of any Maintenance Update or associated Documentation under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "VNE intends to transfer Maintenance Updates and associated Documentation to Converge by remote telecommunications, if feasible, to a Converge computer. Should remote transfer not be possible, VNE may consider alternative methods. Converge acknowledges that physical media will not be transferred.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will transfer' with 'intends to transfer, if feasible', making the method of delivery uncertain. The mandatory 'will be installed by VNE' is changed to 'VNE may consider alternative methods'. The location is removed. This creates uncertainty about how Maintenance Updates will be delivered and whether VNE is obligated to ensure successful delivery.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with basic contract law principles requiring clear terms regarding delivery of goods or services. The lack of a defined delivery method could lead to disputes over whether VNE has fulfilled its obligations.",

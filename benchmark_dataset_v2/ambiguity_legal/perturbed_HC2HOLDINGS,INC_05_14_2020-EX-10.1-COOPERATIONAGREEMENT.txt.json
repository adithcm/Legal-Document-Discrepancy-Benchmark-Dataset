                "explanation": "Changing 'must provide' to 'should endeavor to provide to the best of their ability' weakens the obligation to disclose required information, introducing ambiguity about the level of effort and completeness expected. This contradicts SEC regulations requiring full and accurate disclosure in proxy statements.",

The MG Capital Parties' responsibility for any breach of this Agreement by any such Affiliate or Associate shall be limited to reasonable efforts to ensure compliance.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall generally seek to comply' and limiting responsibility to 'reasonable efforts' creates ambiguity and weakens the legally binding nature of the clause. This contradicts general contract law principles which require strict adherence to agreed terms.",

                "changed_text": "Each of the Parties will endeavor, within reason, during the Standstill Period, to ensure that neither Party nor its direct representatives publicly disparage the other Party or its direct representatives in a manner intentionally designed to cause material harm to the business or reputation of the other Party, provided that nothing shall prevent either party from disclosing facts and circumstances related to any litigation. Each party will not be held liable for statements made by parties that are not their direct representatives.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits disparagement of the other party and their representatives. The modification weakens this clause by adding 'endeavor, within reason' and restricting liability to direct representatives, thereby creating ambiguity about the level of effort required to prevent disparagement and excludes liability for any public statement from the party's indirect representatives. This might contradict the intended scope of protection against reputational harm and the fiduciary duties expected of parties bound by the agreement by potentially allowing indirect disparagement.",

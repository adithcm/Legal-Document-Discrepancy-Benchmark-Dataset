                "original_text": "The Company shall protect, indemnify and hold harmless each of Nantz Communications and Nantz against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, arising out of, or in any way connected with such Endorsement, in any advertising or promotional materials furnished by or on behalf of the Company, actions or omissions of the Company or any claim or action for personal injury, death or other cause of action involving alleged defects in Ashworth Products, including but not limited to indemnification of reasonable legal expenses incurred in defense of all such claims.  Further, Nantz Communications or Nantz shall have the right to select legal counsel to represent it or him in the event of any such claims or legal proceedings, and the costs of such legal representation shall be paid by the Company.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall endeavor to protect, indemnify and hold harmless each of Nantz Communications and Nantz against expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, arising out of, or in any way connected with such Endorsement, in any advertising or promotional materials furnished by or on behalf of the Company, actions or omissions of the Company or any claim or action for personal injury, death or other cause of action involving alleged defects in Ashworth Products. Further, Nantz Communications or Nantz shall have the option to select legal counsel to represent it or him in the event of any such claims or legal proceedings, and the Company will consider covering the costs of such legal representation.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall protect' with 'shall endeavor to protect', making indemnification less definitive. It also changes 'shall have the right' to 'shall have the option', giving the company discretion. Replacing 'shall be paid by the Company' with 'the Company will consider covering the costs' introduces significant ambiguity about payment, undermining the indemnification agreement.",

                "original_text": "The Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, advertising and product liability insurance each with limits no less than $5,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, the Company will submit to Nantz Communications a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz Communications and Nantz as insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Nantz Communications at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "The Company intends to secure advertising and product liability insurance with policy limits it deems adequate. The Company will attempt to provide Nantz Communications with a certificate of insurance naming Nantz Communications and Nantz as insured parties. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure the insurer provides notice of any termination or material modification of the policy.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"agrees to provide and maintain\" to \"intends to secure\" significantly weakens the obligation to maintain insurance. Replacing the specific limit of \"no less than $5,000,000\" with \"policy limits it deems adequate\" introduces subjectivity. Replacing the mandatory action of \"will submit\" with the discretionary term \"will attempt to provide\" creates ambiguity in the contractual language. Removing the firm requirement for notification from the insurer for material modification is a significant change, undermining the insurance provision.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be entitled to recover' to 'may petition the court to recover, at the court's discretion' introduces ambiguity and makes the recovery of attorney fees discretionary rather than mandatory. This weakens the clause substantially. The amendment allows for the court's discretion, which creates uncertainty as opposed to the original language, which unambiguously stated that the prevailing party was entitled to receive it.",

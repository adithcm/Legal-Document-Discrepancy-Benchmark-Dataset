Further, Nantz Communications or Nantz shall have the",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates full indemnification. The modified text uses 'endeavor to protect', 'some expenses', 'potentially arising', and 'vaguely connected' to weaken the obligation. This creates ambiguity about the extent of the company's responsibility, making the indemnification clause difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law regarding indemnification requires clear and unambiguous language to be enforceable (California Civil Code Section 2778). This change introduces ambiguity, potentially making the indemnification clause unenforceable under California law.",

The Company further agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, a policy of Directors and Officers Insurance with limits no less than $25,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, the Company will submit to Nantz Communications a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz as an insured party, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Nantz Communications at least twenty (20) days in advance hereof.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will attempt to provide advertising and product liability insurance with suggested limits around $5,000,000. The company will try to submit a policy or certificate of insurance, naming Nantz Communications and Nantz as insured parties, and try to ensure the insurer will give some notice of termination or modification. The Company will also try to provide a Directors and Officers Insurance policy with suggested limits around $25,000,000 and submit a policy or certificate of insurance naming Nantz as an insured party, and try to ensure the insurer will give some notice of termination or modification.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates the provision and maintenance of specific insurance policies with defined limits and notification requirements. By changing 'agrees to provide and maintain' to 'will attempt to provide', 'no less than $5,000,000' to 'suggested limits around $5,000,000' and adding 'try to ensure' for notice requirements, the legal obligation is weakened and made ambiguous. The precise requirements are now discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "California law requires contracts to be definite and certain. The ambiguity introduced regarding the insurance coverage and notification weakens the enforceability of this clause. This may violate the principle of providing clear and defined contractual obligations in insurance contracts.",

Nantz Communications and Nantz expressly agree that the Endorsement will not be granted to anyone other than the Company for use during the Term in connection with the advertisement and promotion of sportswear apparel, hats and shoes. Notwithstanding the foregoing Nantz shall be permitted to wear a Lynx hat or clothing logo when performing promotional services for Lynx and to use Lynx equipment when performing any promotional services for the Company in which equipment will be used.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, neither Nantz Communications nor Nantz shall generally enter into activities that obviously conflict with their obligations, focusing on avoiding what might clearly seem to be endorsements of competing sportswear without explicit approval. Nantz Communications and Nantz agree that the Endorsement will typically not be granted to others for sportswear advertisement. Nantz is still generally permitted to use Lynx gear.",
                "explanation": "The phrases 'shall enter into any activity' is changed to 'shall generally enter into activities that obviously conflict' making it less restrictive and introduces subjectivity. 'which reasonably appears to be an endorsement' is replaced with 'what might clearly seem to be endorsements' creating ambiguity about the definition of 'endorsement'. 'will not be granted' is changed to 'will typically not be granted' suggesting it is not a steadfast restriction.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits contracts that restrain someone from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business. This provision could be interpreted as an unlawful restraint of trade if the term “obviously conflict” is overly broad, especially in a state like California which has strong protections against non-compete agreements. By making the terms vague and subjective, the agreement is open to interpretation and challenges.",

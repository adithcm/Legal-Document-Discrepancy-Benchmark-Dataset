            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Investor agrees to make, and the applicable Borrower(s) agree(s) to accept, Required Capital Contributions in respect of the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable) in an amount sufficient to cause (via an addition to Adjusted EBITDAR in the amount of such Required Capital Contributions) the Borrowers to comply with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter.",
                "changed_text": "The Investor shall endeavor to make, and the applicable Borrower(s) shall attempt to accept, Required Capital Contributions in respect of the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable) in an amount that may generally contribute to the Borrowers' compliance with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agrees to make' and 'agrees to accept' with 'shall endeavor to make' and 'shall attempt to accept' weakens the obligation to make and accept capital contributions. The addition of 'may generally contribute' introduces further ambiguity, making compliance with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 less certain. This weakens the enforceability of the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The original text formed a legally binding obligation to make capital contributions. This edit moves it toward a 'good faith' effort, but does not guarantee contributions which is a violation of a clearly defined standard.",

                "changed_text": "Required Capital Contributions should ideally be made by Investor via wire transfer into a suitable account.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be made' to 'should ideally be made' weakens the mandatory nature of the wire transfer. Replacing 'directly into the Special Account' with 'into a suitable account' allows for interpretation and deviates from the required method of payment, creating ambiguity and undermining the Agent and Lenders' control over funds.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - The change introduces uncertainty by not clearly defining the method or destination of capital contributions, violating the clearly prescribed requirement in the original contract.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Investor agrees to deliver to the Agent, from time to time, promptly following Agent's request therefor, a sworn affidavit or other evidence reasonably acceptable to the Agent substantiating that the Investor has committed capital in an aggregate minimum amount equal to $5,000,000 less the sum of all Required Capital Contributions (if any) actually made by the Investor during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Investor will attempt to provide the Agent, when convenient, an affidavit or other evidence as they see fit, suggesting that the Investor may have committed capital around $5,000,000.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the original wording to include phrases like 'will attempt to provide', 'when convenient', 'as they see fit', and 'suggesting that the Investor may have,' the clause becomes substantially weaker. The clear obligation to provide a 'sworn affidavit' becomes discretionary and less reliable. The phrase 'around $5,000,000' replaces the precise amount, creating ambiguity. This change eliminates any clear legal obligation of reporting the commitment of funds.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Original text forms a legal obligation, modified text does not.",

The Investor agrees to make, and the applicable Borrower(s) agree(s) to accept, Required Capital Contributions in respect of the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable) in an amount sufficient to cause (via an addition to Adjusted EBITDAR in the amount of such Required Capital Contributions) the Borrowers to comply with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. The Agent further acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether other \"Events of Default\" (as defined therein) have occurred and are continuing under the Financing Agreement, in no event shall the Investor be obligated to make any Required Capital Contributions hereunder if the Borrowers have fully complied with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter for the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable).",
                "changed_text": "2. Contributions to Capital. The Investor will endeavor to make, and the applicable Borrower(s) will endeavor to accept, Required Capital Contributions in respect of the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable) in an amount that may assist the Borrowers in generally aligning with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions hereunder shall be loosely limited to an aggregate amount of up to $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. The Agent further acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether other \"Events of Default\" (as defined therein) have occurred and are continuing under the Financing Agreement, the Investor's contribution will be appreciated, but is not necessarily required if the Borrowers have demonstrated an attempt to comply with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter for the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable).",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"agrees to make\" with \"will endeavor to make\" and \"comply\" with \"generally aligning with,\" the obligation becomes vague and unenforceable. The phrase 'loosely limited to an aggregate amount of up to $5,000,000' further weakens the financial commitment. Changing 'in no event shall the Investor be obligated' to 'Investor's contribution will be appreciated, but is not necessarily required if the Borrowers have demonstrated an attempt to comply' reduces a hard stop to a mere suggestion, all of which undermine the original clear legal obligation.",

                "explanation": "The use of \"should ideally be made around,\" \"perhaps longer,\" and \"possibly ninety (90) days\" introduces significant ambiguity regarding the timing of the capital contributions. This eliminates the original, clear deadline, making it difficult to enforce a specific timeline for the investor's obligations. This lack of definiteness undermines the contract's enforceability.",

Any one or more of the following events might constitute a \"Maintenance Event of Default\" under this Agreement: (a) if the Investor appears to have failed to pay, when and as seemingly due, any Required Capital Contribution and such apparent failure continues for what seems to be five (5) days; (b) if the Investor arguably fails to perform some of the Investor's obligations in this Agreement, and such potential failure seemingly continues for roughly fifteen (15) days, (c) if any warranty or statement made or information provided by the Investor in connection with this Agreement is potentially untrue or potentially misleading in a general sense on the date made; (d) if Investor maybe fails to have committed capital in a somewhat aggregate minimum amount equal to perhaps $5,000,000 less the sum of all Required Capital Contributions (if any) actually made by the Investor during the term of this Agreement, as loosely determined based on the most recent information somewhat made available by the Investor to the Agent pursuant to Section 20 below; or (e) if the Investor becomes seemingly insolvent or generally appears to fail to pay, or kind of admits in writing its apparent inability to pay, its debts as they mature or potentially applies for or loosely consents to the potential appointment of a trustee or other custodian for its properties, or perhaps makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or other proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, is perhaps instituted by or potentially against the Investor. Upon the potential occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, might consider exercising some of its rights and potential remedies loosely available at law or in equity (perhaps including, but not very limited to, the potential rights and potential remedies arguably described in Section 4 above).

                "explanation": "The changed text replaces definitive language with speculative and vague terms. Using words like \"might,\" \"appears,\" \"seemingly,\" \"arguably,\" \"potentially,\" \"perhaps,\" and \"loosely\" throughout the section completely undermines the clarity and enforceability of the Events of Default clauses. This makes it virtually impossible to determine when a default has actually occurred, creating a situation where the Investor can avoid accountability. The addition of terms like 'kind of', 'somewhat', 'in a general sense', 'to have failed', and 'may consider', makes the paragraph almost completely meaningless from a legal standpoint.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - The changes create such extreme vagueness and uncertainty that the Events of Default clauses become legally meaningless and unenforceable. This undermines the fundamental principle of contract certainty.",

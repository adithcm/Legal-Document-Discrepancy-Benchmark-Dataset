                "original_text": "Licensee shall pay to Licensor for each Licensed Product licensed to a Redistributor or a Customer a licensee fee equal to 50% of all revenues received (without deduction for value added tax, if any, but excluding any revenues for maintenance and support or upgrade services, which revenues are covered in paragraph (b) below) by Licensee under the Redistributor Agreement or Sublicense applicable to such Licensed Product.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall remit a percentage, to be determined at Licensor's discretion, of the revenues generated from each Licensed Product sublicensed or distributed. This percentage may or may not account for various deductions.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity in the calculation of fees due to Licensor. Replacing a fixed 50% with 'a percentage, to be determined at Licensor's discretion' makes the financial obligation vague and potentially unfair. The phrase 'may or may not account for various deductions' further obscures the calculation, allowing for unpredictable and potentially arbitrary fee assessments.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law and potentially Unfair Trade Practices laws, as it creates an undefined and unilaterally changeable financial obligation.",

Licensee agrees and covenants to comply fully with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to adopt such policies and procedures in connection with, the exporting of the Licensed Products and Documentation as may be required thereby.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to obtain necessary approvals and licenses before exporting any Licensed Product or Documentation, subject to perceived feasibility. Licensee aims to generally comply with applicable export laws and regulations, adjusting procedures as deemed convenient.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the legal obligation regarding export compliance. Changing 'shall obtain prior written approval' to 'shall endeavor to obtain necessary approvals and licenses, subject to perceived feasibility' introduces a subjective element that allows Licensee to bypass the approval process based on their own assessment. Similarly, replacing 'agrees and covenants to comply fully' with 'aims to generally comply' makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory.",

                "changed_text": "Manufacturer should endeavor to manufacture and supply each Product (including disposing of all Waste and other materials) in general accordance with applicable Specifications, applicable Laws, the Quality Agreement, and this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a strict obligation to manufacture and supply products in accordance with all applicable laws. By changing 'shall manufacture' to 'should endeavor to manufacture' and including terms like 'general accordance', the obligation becomes ambiguous and less enforceable. The phrase 'general accordance' is vague and allows for subjective interpretation, weakening the requirement for strict compliance.",

Manufacturer shall: (a) obtain and comply with all licenses, consents and permits required under applicable Laws in the Territory (and Manufacturer shall provide Customer with a copy of all such licenses, consents and permits that are material upon Customer's reasonable request); and (b) comply with all applicable Laws in the Territory with respect to its manufacturing and packaging processes, the Facility or otherwise, to permit the performance of its obligations hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer should use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Customer in responding to requests for information from Governmental Authorities. Manufacturer might obtain licenses and permits if deemed necessary and will try to comply with applicable laws to permit the performance of its obligations hereunder. The specifics of such compliance will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the manufacturer to obtain licenses, permits and comply with all applicable laws. The modified text weakens this obligation by using terms like 'should use reasonable efforts', 'might obtain licenses', and 'will try to comply', making the obligation less stringent. The phrase 'The specifics of such compliance will be determined on a case-by-case basis' introduces further ambiguity, reducing the accountability for regulatory compliance.",

Manufacturer shall quarantine all such Non-Complying Products and shall promptly submit to Customer a report detailing the nature of such non-compliance and Manufacturer's recommended disposition, including the investigation and testing done. Manufacturer shall also provide any additional information regarding such Non-Complying Product as may reasonably be requested by Customer.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer may, at its discretion, release Product for Delivery to Customer that does not strictly conform to the covenants in Section 5.2(e), provided the Manufacturer documents that it made commercially reasonable efforts to conform to such standard. Manufacturer should attempt to quarantine such Products when it is feasible and may provide a report if such action is deemed prudent. Manufacturer will make reasonable attempts to provide information requested by Customer.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall not release' with 'may, at its discretion, release', and weakening 'shall quarantine' to 'should attempt to quarantine when it is feasible', the obligation to prevent the delivery of non-complying product is significantly weakened. The addition of 'commercially reasonable efforts' introduces a subjective criterion that could allow the manufacturer to justify releasing non-compliant product. The term 'prudent' introduces another ambiguous aspect that is opened to interpretation.",

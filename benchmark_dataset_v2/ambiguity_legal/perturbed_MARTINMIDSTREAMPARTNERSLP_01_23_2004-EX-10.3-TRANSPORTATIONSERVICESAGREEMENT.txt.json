                "original_text": "Owner agrees that said equipment shall be maintained in a seaworthy, staunch, tight and suitable condition and, to the best of Owner's knowledge, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Owner will attempt to maintain said equipment in what it considers a suitable condition, and will endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation to maintain equipment in a seaworthy condition and comply with laws. Replacing 'shall be maintained' with 'will attempt to maintain' and 'in compliance' with 'will endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity. The phrase \"what it considers a suitable condition\" introduces subjectivity and avoids the objective standard of 'seaworthy'.",

                "changed_text": "Owner will, in the case of an escape or discharge of products or threat of escape or discharge of same from the applicable vessel into the navigable waters of the United States, consider undertaking measures that it reasonably believes are adequate to address pollution damage.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'promptly undertake such measures as are reasonably necessary or which may be required by applicable laws' with 'consider undertaking measures that it reasonably believes are adequate'. This weakens the obligation to promptly take necessary measures and replaces it with a subjective assessment of adequacy, potentially contradicting requirements under environmental protection laws.",

                "changed_text": "Owner intends to maintain a drug and alcohol abuse policy applicable to the vessels, with the goal of generally aligning with U.S. Coast Guard guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'warrants that it will maintain and enforce' with 'intends to maintain' and 'complies in all material respects' with 'with the goal of generally aligning'. This introduces ambiguity, making the obligation to comply with minimum standards non-mandatory and subject to interpretation. The terms 'intends to' and 'generally aligning' make the compliance level uncertain and unenforceable.",

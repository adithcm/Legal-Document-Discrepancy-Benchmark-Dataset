                "original_text": "Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and Playboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against all liability  whatsoever which may be incurred by them or any of them as a result of any alleged defects in material or workmanship  in the merchandise covered by this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will endeavor to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and Playboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against liability which they deem reasonable as a result of possible defects in material or workmanship in the merchandise covered by this Contract.",
                "explanation": "The term 'endeavor to defend' weakens the obligation to defend and indemnify, making it discretionary. 'Liability which they deem reasonable' introduces subjectivity, allowing the Supplier to determine what constitutes reasonable liability. 'Possible defects' also weakens the liability compared to 'alleged defects'. This creates ambiguity and potentially contradicts basic contract law principles regarding warranties and product liability.",

                "original_text": "Supplier agrees that no production or manufacture of any merchandise covered by this Contract will commence until this  Contract has been signed, dated and returned by Supplier to Purchaser. Supplier further agrees that it will not produce,  cause to be produced or assist in the production of more units than are specified by Purchaser nor will Supplier produce, cause to be produced or assist in the production of any product or item not specifically requested by Purchaser using any  or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark, copyright, designations, names, phrases, designs or symbols similar to  any or all of the Playboy Properties during or at any time after the completion of merchandise requested by this Contract.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier agrees that production or manufacture of any merchandise covered by this Contract may commence at its discretion, provided that a good faith effort is made to return the contract to purchaser. Supplier will aim to avoid producing more units than specified, and also will make reasonable efforts to avoid producing product not requested using the Playboy Properties.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will not commence until...' with 'may commence at its discretion' makes the contract signing requirement optional. Replacing 'will not produce' with 'aim to avoid producing more units' and 'will make reasonable efforts to avoid producing product not requested' softens the obligation to a mere intention, which is vague and unenforceable. The overall effect significantly reduces the supplier's liability for producing non-compliant goods or beginning production prematurely, violating contract law's expectation of definite and binding commitments.",

                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'may, if feasible' and 'consider delivering' turns a mandatory action into a suggestion. Replacing 'will destroy in the presence of Purchaser' with 'explore options to destroy in a manner deemed suitable' grants the supplier complete discretion over the method and timing of destruction, rendering the clause unenforceable. This creates uncertainty about the handling of Playboy's intellectual property and contradicts standard IP protection practices.",

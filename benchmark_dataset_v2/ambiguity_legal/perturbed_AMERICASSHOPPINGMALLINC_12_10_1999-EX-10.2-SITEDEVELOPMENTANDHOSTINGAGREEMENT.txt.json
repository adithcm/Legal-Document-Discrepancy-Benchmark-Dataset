                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "HDI shall design, develop, implement, operate, maintain and manage, and enable the Company to establish a presence on the World Wide Web (\"Site\") to make available to Internet users on demand, men's and women's apparel and accessories from the Deerskin Catalog (\"Deerskin Products\").",

                "explanation": "The original text used definitive terms like 'shall,' creating a clear obligation. The modified text uses 'endeavor,' which is weaker and implies an attempt rather than a guaranteed result. This ambiguity contradicts consumer protection laws, which often require businesses to fulfill promised services.",

In the event that HDI fails to have the Site fully operational within seventy (70) days from the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty.",

If the Site is not operational within seventy (70) days, the Company may consider its options.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the definite 'shall' with weaker terms like 'will aim' and 'reasonable timeframe,' creating uncertainty about HDI's obligation. The consequence of failure is also weakened from a guaranteed right to terminate to a vague 'may consider its options.' This contradicts contract law principles of clear and definite terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires HDI to promote the Site 'no less favorably' than its own catalogs. The modified text weakens this obligation significantly by replacing 'shall promote' with 'should consider promoting' and 'no less favorably' with 'in a manner somewhat similar.' This introduces ambiguity about the level of promotion required, contradicting the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts under New York law.",

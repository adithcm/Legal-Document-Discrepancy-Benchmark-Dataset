                "original_text": "The ValueAct Designee agrees that, at all times while serving as a member of the Board, he will (i) meet all director independence and other standards of the Company, the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule 10A- 3; and (ii) be qualified to serve as a director under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") (clauses (i) and (ii), the \"Conditions\").

The ValueAct Designee may, at their discretion, advise the Nominating Committee if they believe they no longer satisfy the Conditions.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"he will\" to \"he will endeavor to\" weakens the obligation to meet director independence standards. Further, changing \"The ValueAct Designee will promptly advise\" to \"The ValueAct Designee may, at their discretion, advise\" makes the reporting of non-compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This creates ambiguity regarding the director's adherence to independence requirements.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall comply' with 'shall generally adhere' makes compliance with company policies less stringent and more open to interpretation. Similarly, changing 'preserve the confidentiality' to 'endeavor to preserve the confidentiality' weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality. These changes introduce ambiguity regarding the director's commitment to following established rules and protecting sensitive information.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall cause' with 'shall use reasonable efforts to ensure' weakens the obligation to have shares present and voted for quorum purposes. Changing 'shall vote in favor of' to 'will consider voting in favor of' and 'in accordance with' to 'generally in accordance with' makes the commitment to support the Board's nominees and recommendations non-binding and subject to discretion. This introduces ambiguity regarding the level of support the ValueAct Group will provide to the Company's proposals, which could conflict with their fiduciary duty and obligations under Delaware law.",

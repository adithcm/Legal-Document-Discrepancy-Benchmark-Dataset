For the purposes of this\nAgreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as any link to the\nNetGrocer Site, whether graphic, text or any combination of\ngraphic and text, served by Excite to a user as part of an\nHTML page, part of the Excite's Internet chat service or part\nof search results displayed in \"Excite Shopping Service\npowered by Jango\".",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a seemingly clear obligation for Excite to deliver a specific number of impressions. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'reasonable commercial efforts' with 'endeavor to deliver some' and 'more or less the same amount' and 'whatever Excite can reasonably justify', which makes the impression target discretionary. The definition of 'Impression' is also weakened by using terms like 'might be,' 'maybe,' and 'possibly,' creating further vagueness and lack of specific performance standards. This contradicts basic contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear and measurable guarantee for click-throughs, with specific quarterly targets. The modified text replaces 'guarantees' with 'aims,' making the obligation non-binding. It also removes all numerical targets and introduces vagueness with phrases like 'some unspecified number,' 'might try,' and 'somewhat evenly,' which makes the click-through obligation practically unenforceable.

                "changed_text": "Excite will endeavor to keep some records related to payments, but the specifics are up to Excite. NetGrocer might, with enough notice, ask someone to look at Excite's records if Excite agrees. If this happens, and there's a big problem, maybe Excite will cover some costs, or maybe not.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear process for NetGrocer to audit Excite's records, including provisions for cost allocation based on audit findings. The modified text replaces 'will maintain accurate records' with 'will endeavor to keep some records,' making the record-keeping obligation discretionary. It weakens NetGrocer's audit right by adding 'if Excite agrees.' The cost allocation clause is made vague by adding 'maybe Excite will cover some costs, or maybe not,' rendering the audit process uncertain and ineffective.

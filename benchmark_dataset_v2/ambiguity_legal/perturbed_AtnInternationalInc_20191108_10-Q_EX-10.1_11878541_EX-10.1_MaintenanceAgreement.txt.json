                "original_text": "Vendor shall comply with all Laws applicable to Vendor's performance under this Agreement, including all Work contemplated herein and all Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T's utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor shall procure all approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement. Vendor shall create and maintain any necessary records and provide any certificate, affidavit or other information or documentation requested or as otherwise required by AT&T: (a) to show compliance by Vendor and its Subcontractors with Laws, (b) to comply or otherwise establish AT&T's compliance with Laws or (c) to allow AT&T to timely respond to any complaints, filings, or other proceedings.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor will attempt to comply with what it believes are the relevant Laws applicable to Vendor's performance under this Agreement, including the Work, Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T's utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor will use its discretion to procure approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that it determines are required. Vendor will create and maintain records and provide certificates, affidavits or other information or documentation as it finds necessary: (a) to show its efforts to comply with Laws, (b) to help establish AT&T's general compliance with Laws or (c) to enable AT&T to address complaints, filings, or other proceedings as reasonably possible.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the obligation of compliance by replacing 'shall comply' with 'will attempt to comply,' introducing discretion for the Vendor. The change from 'shall procure' to 'will use its discretion to procure' makes obtaining necessary permits optional. Similarly, substituting 'as required by AT&T' with 'as it finds necessary' allows Vendor to determine compliance documentation, undermining the clear legal obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts the strict compliance requirements of various federal and state regulations, including environmental regulations (e.g., Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act) and telecommunications regulations, which mandate specific permits and compliance measures, not discretionary efforts.",

AT&T and its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors) and governmental authorities shall have the right to review such records (\"AT&T Audits\") held and created by Vendor, to verify the following:\n\n(i) the accuracy of Vendor's invoices and AT&T's payment obligations hereunder;\n\n(ii) that the Work charged for was actually performed;\n\n(iii) that the Services have been and are being provided in accordance with this Agreement;\n\n(iv) the integrity of Vendor's systems that process, store, support, maintain, and transmit AT&T data;\n\n(v) Vendor's records relating to the performance of Vendor's Subcontractors with respect to any portion of the Services; and\n\n(vi) that Vendor and its Subcontractors are complying with Section 3.6 hereof.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor should keep records relating to the Work and the performance of this Agreement, as it deems appropriate. AT&T and its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors) and governmental authorities may request to review such records (\"AT&T Audits\") held and created by Vendor, to generally verify the following:\n\n(i) the general accuracy of Vendor's invoices and AT&T's payment obligations hereunder;\n\n(ii) that a reasonable amount of the Work charged for was performed;\n\n(iii) that the Services are generally being provided in accordance with this Agreement;\n\n(iv) the general state of Vendor's systems that process, store, support, maintain, and transmit AT&T data;\n\n(v) Vendor's records relating to the performance of Vendor's Subcontractors with respect to some portion of the Services; and\n\n(vi) that Vendor and its Subcontractors are aiming to comply with Section 3.6 hereof.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement for accurate and complete records by introducing subjectivity ('as it deems appropriate'). Replacing 'shall have the right to review' with 'may request to review' makes the audit process discretionary. Modifying 'verify the accuracy' to 'generally verify the general accuracy' creates ambiguity, and other small language changes like 'reasonable amount of work' and 'aiming to comply' weaken the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "This violates Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires publicly traded companies (like ATN International, Inc.) to maintain accurate and reliable financial reporting. SOX mandates strict internal controls and documentation.",

                "changed_text": "Vendor will try to maintain property insurance as it deems necessary, aiming to provide coverage for potential losses to AT&T's property in its care, custody, and control. AT&T may be named as an additional insured.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation replaces the mandatory 'shall maintain' with the discretionary 'will try to maintain,' making the insurance coverage optional. Changing 'full replacement cost' to 'aiming to provide coverage for potential losses' introduces ambiguity about the level of coverage. Finally, changing 'shall be named' to 'may be named' makes naming AT&T as an additional insured optional, severely weakening the protection afforded to AT&T.",
                "contradicted_law": "This potentially violates standard contract law principles where adequate insurance coverage is required to protect assets and mitigate liabilities. The ambiguity jeopardizes AT&T's financial interests in case of property loss.",

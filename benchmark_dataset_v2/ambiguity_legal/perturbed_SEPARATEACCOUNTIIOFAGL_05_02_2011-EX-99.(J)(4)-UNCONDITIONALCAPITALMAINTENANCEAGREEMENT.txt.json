                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'falls below' with 'arguably falls below', 'shall' with 'shall endeavor', 'within the respective time periods' with 'within reasonable time periods', 'in compliance with' with 'with consideration of', 'qualify' with 'might qualify', 'as a contribution and not as a loan' with 'potentially as a contribution and perhaps not as a loan', and 'in an amount such that' with 'in a possible amount such that.'

                "original_text": "The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the        percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be        agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon        the date of the filing of the Company's 2010 Annual Statement with the        Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against        the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each        of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service        (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the        obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum        Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and        revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the        parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material        changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of        S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the        Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand,        which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that        under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or        instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is        treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand,        and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any        other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which        AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum        Percentage then in effect.",
                "changed_text": "The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" may be a percentage roughly approximate to the percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which should ideally be considered by AIG and the Company sometime around once every year beginning upon the date of the filing of the Company's 2010 Annual Statement with the Domiciliary State's insurance department and upon occasional review of the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Despite the previous understanding of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto may consider from time to time whether to revise the Specified Minimum Percentage, if the parties happen to feel it might be useful, potentially to account for (a) certain changes at some point after the date hereof to certain Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or vague instructions, on the other hand, which causes results under the Agency Criteria that seem somewhat different from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a transaction that might be considered material and that is treated somewhat differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other situation affecting the Company which AIG and the Company vaguely remember meriting some reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity by using terms like 'may be,' 'roughly approximate,' 'should ideally be considered,' 'sometime around,' 'upon occasional review,' 'happen to feel,' 'might be useful,' 'potentially to account for,' 'certain changes at some point,' 'vague instructions', 'seem somewhat different,' 'might be considered material,' and 'vaguely remember.' This makes the process of determining and adjusting the Specified Minimum Percentage discretionary and unclear, undermining the capital maintenance agreement's effectiveness.",

                "changed_text": "Potentially subject to some interpretations of applicable law and potentially subject to some degree of approval, from some members of the Company's senior management, possibly relevant management committees, the board of directors, and an insurance regulator if they happen to be interested, the Company kind of acknowledges that, in a way that is vaguely similar to past practice and\n\n       any other requirements of AIG that AIG feels like imposing, it will generally try to consider all financial and budgetary planning, risk mitigation, derisking or pricing, corporate governance, investment, informational and procedural requirements that AIG suggests.",
                "explanation": "The modification significantly weakens the obligation by adding ambiguity and discretion. Phrases like 'potentially subject to some interpretations,' 'potentially subject to some degree of approval,' 'from some members,' 'possibly relevant,' 'an insurance regulator if they happen to be interested,' 'kind of acknowledges,' 'in a way that is vaguely similar,' 'any other requirements of AIG that AIG feels like imposing,' 'generally try to consider,' and 'that AIG suggests' all reduce the certainty and enforceability of the Company's compliance with AIG's requirements. This introduces significant subjectivity and makes it unclear what actions the Company is actually obligated to take.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment  Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as \"Expense Waiver\") sufficient to produce a Net  Investment Income of zero.",
                "changed_text": "If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment Adviser may consider waiving a portion of its Advisory Fee or contributing a discretionary amount towards offsetting the deficit.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the requirement for the Investment Adviser to cover the Fund's losses. Replacing 'shall waive' with 'may consider waiving' and 'reimburse the Fund an amount sufficient to produce a Net Investment Income of zero' with 'contributing a discretionary amount towards offsetting the deficit' introduces ambiguity and makes the obligation non-mandatory. This ambiguity could potentially lead to a violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which emphasizes protecting fund shareholders through appropriate fee structures and loss mitigation strategies.",

                "changed_text": "If the Investment Adviser chooses to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser will attempt to make such payment within a reasonable timeframe after each month-end.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'is required to reimburse' to 'chooses to reimburse' makes reimbursement discretionary rather than mandatory. Additionally, replacing 'shall make such payment within 30 days' with 'will attempt to make such payment within a reasonable timeframe' introduces ambiguity regarding the payment deadline. This weakens the obligation and could potentially contradict SEC regulations concerning timely and accurate financial reporting by investment companies.",

                "changed_text": "Any Expense Waiver recovery payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser should generally not cause the Operating Expense for the Fund's full year of operations to significantly exceed 1.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets, absent unforeseen circumstances.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'shall not cause' to 'should generally not cause' weakens the restriction on expense waiver recovery payments. Further, adding 'significantly exceed' and 'absent unforeseen circumstances' introduces additional ambiguity, making the expense limit less enforceable and potentially violating SEC regulations designed to protect investors from excessive fund expenses.",

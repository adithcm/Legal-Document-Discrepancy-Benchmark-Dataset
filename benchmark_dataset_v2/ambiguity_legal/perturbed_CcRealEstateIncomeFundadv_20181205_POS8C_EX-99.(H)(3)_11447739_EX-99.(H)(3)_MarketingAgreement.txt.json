                "original_text": "S2K agrees, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, through its Authorized S2K Representatives, to use its reasonable best efforts to market the Funds to the Intermediaries, and to identify, refer and/or introduce Intermediaries to the Funds.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'reasonable best efforts' with 'endeavor' and 'generally identify' weakens the obligation to market the Funds and refer Intermediaries. This creates ambiguity regarding the required level of effort and specificity, potentially conflicting with FINRA's requirements for diligent marketing and suitability determinations.",

Documentation not defined as \"marketing pieces,\" may be reviewed and approved by either S2K or the Distributor at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall provide review' to 'may offer to review, as resources allow' makes the distributor's review obligation discretionary, potentially conflicting with their responsibility to supervise marketing materials. Similarly, 'shall be principally reviewed and approved by S2K' becoming 'may be reviewed and approved by either S2K or the Distributor at their discretion' blurs the lines of responsibility, undermining regulatory oversight.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall obtain' with 'should attempt to obtain' and 'use their best efforts to maintain' with 'generally maintain,' the obligation to secure and maintain necessary licenses becomes vague. The addition of 'that may be deemed' and 'as considered applicable' introduces subjectivity and ambiguity, undermining the requirement for proper registration under securities laws.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "BP shall conduct all its activities under this Agreement as a reasonable prudent operator, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, in accordance with good oilfield practice, and in compliance with applicable law and regulation, but in no event shall BP have any liability to Company for losses sustained or liabilities or obligations incurred except such as may result from BP's gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "changed_text": "BP will endeavor to conduct its activities under this Agreement in a manner generally consistent with industry practices and applicable law, but BP's liability to Company for losses shall be limited to instances of gross negligence proven with clear and convincing evidence.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and weakens BP's obligation. Replacing 'shall conduct' with 'will endeavor to conduct' and removing the explicit mention of 'due diligence and dispatch' creates uncertainty. Adding 'proven with clear and convincing evidence' sets an ambiguously high standard of proof, making it difficult for Company to hold BP accountable, conflicting with Louisiana's standard negligence laws.",

                "original_text": "Unless Company elects by thirty (30) days' prior written notice to BP either to take in kind or to separately dispose of its share of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons, BP shall in good faith, to the extent it can do so, cause Company's share of production from the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Wells to be marketed and sold to either a Third Party or to an Affiliate of BP in a commercially reasonable manner, which terms shall not be less than on the same terms and conditions as BP's share of production from such wells are sold.",
                "changed_text": "Unless Company elects by thirty (30) days' prior written notice to BP either to take in kind or to separately dispose of its share of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons, BP will attempt to market and sell Company's share of production in a manner it deems appropriate. Terms may be generally consistent with those of BP's share.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces significant ambiguity. Replacing 'shall in good faith' with 'will attempt' weakens BP's obligation to market Company's share effectively. Substituting 'in a commercially reasonable manner' with 'in a manner it deems appropriate' allows BP to prioritize its interests, potentially at the expense of Company, violating Louisiana Mineral Code's implied duty of good faith in marketing mineral production.",
                "contradicted_law": "Louisiana Mineral Code Article 122: Implied obligations of a mineral lessee.",

                "original_text": "At all times while this Agreement is in effect, Company shall carry insurance of the types and in the minimum amounts set forth in Exhibit \"G\". All such insurance set forth in Exhibit \"G\" shall specifically name BP as an additional insured or provide that the insurer shall waive all rights of subrogation against BP.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Company should maintain insurance coverage. The specifics of such coverage will be determined at Company's discretion, although naming BP as an additional insured is encouraged where feasible.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a clear obligation for insurance. The modified version weakens this by changing 'shall carry' to 'should maintain', making insurance coverage discretionary. Removing the mandatory reference to Exhibit G leaves the required types and minimum amounts undefined. Replacing 'shall specifically name BP' with 'is encouraged where feasible' introduces ambiguity, potentially leaving BP unprotected, which is non-compliant with general contractual obligations under Louisiana law to perform agreements in good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "Louisiana Civil Code Article 1983: Contracts have the effect of law for the parties and may be dissolved only through the consent of the parties or on grounds provided by law. They must be performed in good faith.",

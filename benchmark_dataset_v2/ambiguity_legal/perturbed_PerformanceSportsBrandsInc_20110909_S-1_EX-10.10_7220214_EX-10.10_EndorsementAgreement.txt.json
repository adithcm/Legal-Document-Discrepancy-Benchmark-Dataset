                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company represents and warrants to North that it will comply with all rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company's activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the use of North's Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company will endeavor to comply with the spirit of all rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company's activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the use of North's Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"will comply\" with \"will endeavor to comply with the spirit of\" weakens the obligation, making it subjective and potentially non-compliant with specific laws. 'Endeavor to comply with the spirit of' provides no guaranteed compliance, which can create potential legal challenges.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires parties to fulfill the exact obligations stipulated in the contract, instead of loosely interpreting the spirit of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement and within the Contract Territory, North agrees to use his best efforts to avoid entering into an agreement with another company or entity for the purpose of endorsing or promoting products similar to the Endorsed Products.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees not to enter' to 'use his best efforts to avoid entering' introduces ambiguity. What constitutes 'best efforts' is subjective and can be difficult to enforce, potentially allowing North to enter agreements with competitors if he can argue he made an effort to avoid it.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires clear and definite obligations, and 'best efforts' standard can be challenged if not clearly defined, failing the contractual clarity test.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'All materials' with 'All relevant materials' and 'absolute property' with 'largely remain the property,' the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the ownership of the Advertising Materials. The terms 'relevant' and 'largely' are not defined, creating confusion as to which materials are owned by the company and to what extent.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires clear definitions of property ownership, especially regarding intellectual property rights. This change conflicts with standard practices for securing exclusive rights, leading to potential intellectual property disputes.",

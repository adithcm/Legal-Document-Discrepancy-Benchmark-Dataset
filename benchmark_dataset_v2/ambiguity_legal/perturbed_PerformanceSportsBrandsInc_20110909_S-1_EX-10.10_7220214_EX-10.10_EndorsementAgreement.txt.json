                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company represents and warrants to North that it will comply with all rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company's activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the use of North's Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",
                "changed_text": "Company represents and warrants to North that it will endeavor to comply with rules, regulations, laws, orders, decrees and ordinances of the United States, each state and political subdivision thereof, and each and every foreign country having legal jurisdiction over any aspect of Company's activities under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the use of North's Likeness in advertisements for and on behalf of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply' to 'will endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' implies an attempt, but not a guarantee of compliance, which is insufficient under various regulations that require strict compliance, such as advertising standards enforced by the FTC and state consumer protection laws.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be deemed by Company to have been approved hereunder if the same is not disapproved by North within seven (7) business days after receipt thereof. North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted hereunder will not be unreasonably disapproved and, if it is disapproved, that Company will be advised of the specific grounds for the disapproval. Company shall not use such disapproved Advertising Materials until it has written approval from North.",
                "changed_text": "North agrees that any Advertising Materials submitted for approval as provided herein may be considered acceptable if not explicitly disapproved by North within what North considers a reasonable timeframe after receipt thereof. North agrees to generally provide feedback on Advertising Materials. Company may proceed with using disapproved Advertising Materials if North's disapproval is deemed unreasonable based on Company’s assessment.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'seven (7) business days' with 'what North considers a reasonable timeframe' makes the approval deadline subjective. Stating North agrees to 'generally provide feedback' is vague compared to providing specific grounds for disapproval. Finally, allowing the Company to use disapproved materials if the disapproval is 'deemed unreasonable based on Company’s assessment' creates a conflict of interest and undermines North's right to approve advertising materials, which could violate North's right of publicity under California law (since the company is based in CA).",

Use Company's F2 branded wedges when competing professionally, conducting public clinics or outings, participating in  public golf events and when appearing at other public functions where it is appropriate to use or have golf clubs at such events (herein  \"Public Events').\n\nb. Golf Bag. Use and carry Company's F2 branded golf bag at all Public Events as defined immediately above. North shall have the right to  place a maximum of two (2) non-competitive third party sponsor names/logos that are of a reasonable size on the belly portion of the F2  branded golf bag.\n\nc. Irons, Woods, Putter. Use reasonable efforts to use F2 branded irons, woods and putter at all Public Events. For purposes of  clarification, North shall not be required to use F2 branded irons, woods and putters.",
                "changed_text": "During the Contract Period and within the Contract Territory, North agrees to:\n\na. Wedges. Consider using Company's F2 branded wedges when competing professionally. The decision to use Company's wedges is ultimately at North’s discretion.\n\nb. Golf Bag. Use and carry Company's F2 branded golf bag when practical. North will try to ensure only non-competitive third party sponsor names/logos are displayed on the bag, as reasonably possible.\n\nc. Irons, Woods, Putter. North may, at his convenience, use F2 branded irons, woods and putter at all Public Events. For purposes of  clarification, North shall not be required to use F2 branded irons, woods and putters.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly weakens the endorsement obligation. 'Consider using' and 'decision to use is ultimately at North’s discretion' for wedges makes the commitment non-binding. Changing 'Use and carry...golf bag at all Public Events' to 'Use and carry...when practical' introduces significant ambiguity, allowing North to avoid using the bag at any event he deems impractical. Replacing 'try to ensure' and 'as reasonably possible' weakens the restriction on sponsor logos. 'North may, at his convenience' is not a requirement to use the other products.",

Contract laws vary by state (Florida, in this case), but generally, a material breach allows the other party to seek damages.",

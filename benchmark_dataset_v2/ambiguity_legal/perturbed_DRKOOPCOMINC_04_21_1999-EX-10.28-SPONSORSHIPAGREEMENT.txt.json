                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Sponsor shall use its best efforts to keep User Data confidential and shall only use such data in an ethical manner. Sponsor may use User Data for its owns purposes, but User Data may not be disclosed, sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of to third parties by Sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall endeavor to keep User Data confidential and shall strive to use such data in a manner it deems ethical. Sponsor may use User Data for its own purposes, but Sponsor will try not to disclose, sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of to third parties unless absolutely necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'best efforts' with 'endeavor' and 'strive' weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality. 'In a manner it deems ethical' introduces subjective interpretation, and 'try not to... unless absolutely necessary' makes data protection discretionary, thus creating non-compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and other data privacy regulations, which require stringent and clearly defined data protection measures.",

                "changed_text": "Each party will consider contacting the other party before removing any of its Materials from its servers, and will explore options to resolve the issue.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will use reasonable efforts' to 'will consider contacting' and 'will work with the other to resolve the issue as quickly as possible' to 'will explore options to resolve the issue' weakens the commitment and introduces subjectivity. There is no definitive obligation to contact the other party before taking action, making the entire clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles that require clear and definitive obligations. The modification could lead to arbitrary removal of materials without proper communication.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the drkoop.com Website available and display the Sponsor Advertising Content twenty four hours per day each day during the term of the Agreement' to 'Drkoop.com will aim to keep the drkoop.com Website accessible and intends to display the Sponsor Advertising Content throughout the term of the Agreement' replaces a clear and somewhat measurable standard (commercially reasonable efforts, 24/7 availability) with vague intentions (aim to keep, intends to display). This change removes any guarantee of uptime or specific performance, making it difficult to prove a breach of contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles which require specificity in obligations. 'Aim' and 'intend' are not enforceable guarantees.",

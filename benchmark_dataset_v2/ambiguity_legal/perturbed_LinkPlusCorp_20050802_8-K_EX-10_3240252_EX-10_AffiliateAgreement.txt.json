                "original_text": "LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers.",

                "explanation": "The original text contains a relatively clear obligation for LKPL to provide office space and access to certain facilities. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'will allow' with 'will attempt to allow' and 'as LKPL deems appropriate,' making the provision of office space discretionary. Similarly, changing 'will have access' to 'may have access, subject to availability' makes the access to facilities uncertain. This ambiguity introduces uncertainty in what LKPL is required to provide.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principle of definiteness; a court may find this ambiguous promise unenforceable, especially if a dispute arises regarding the 'appropriateness' of the space or the 'availability' of facilities.",

                "explanation": "The original text is a strict requirement for compliance with LKPL's lease. The modified text replaces 'must at all times' with 'should generally' and 'strictly in accordance' with 'in a manner consistent with the spirit of,' weakening the obligation. This ambiguity makes it unclear what constitutes compliance, potentially conflicting with the requirements of LKPL's lease, which is the controlling document. A judge may decide that the original lease is in conflict with these changes.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the payment timeline. The modified text uses 'should typically,' 'approximately 45 days,' and 'barring unforeseen circumstances' introduces ambiguity, making the payment deadline unclear and subject to interpretation. This weakens the enforceable nature of the payment schedule and could conflict with state laws regarding timely payments and breach of contract.",

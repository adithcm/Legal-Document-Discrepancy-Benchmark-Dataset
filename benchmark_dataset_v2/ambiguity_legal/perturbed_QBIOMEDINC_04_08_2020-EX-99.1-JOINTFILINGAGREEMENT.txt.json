                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each should endeavor to file such amendments in a timely manner, and strive for completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be held accountable for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to ensure timely, complete, and accurate filings by replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should endeavor' and 'strive for'. This introduces ambiguity and makes it less clear what constitutes a failure to meet the filing requirements. The term 'held accountable' introduces an ambiguous threshold for liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13d-1(k) which require accurate and timely filings and establish liability for failure to comply.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that this Joint Filing Agreement may, if deemed necessary, be included as an exhibit to such statement and any such amendment.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'may, if deemed necessary,' introduces ambiguity regarding whether the Joint Filing Agreement must always be included. This weakens the previously mandatory obligation and potentially contradicts SEC filing requirements where such agreements are generally required exhibits.",
                "contradicted_law": "SEC regulations regarding Schedule 13G filings, which generally require joint filing agreements as exhibits.",
                "location": "Paragraph 1"

                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the statement on Schedule 13G with respect to the equity securities of Q Biomed, Inc. is, and any amendment thereto signed by each of the undersigned will, to the extent practicable, be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in general alignment with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be' to 'will, to the extent practicable' introduces an element of discretion and potential non-compliance with the mandatory filing requirements. Furthermore, changing 'in accordance with' to 'in general alignment with' weakens the obligation to strictly follow Rule 13d-1(k).",

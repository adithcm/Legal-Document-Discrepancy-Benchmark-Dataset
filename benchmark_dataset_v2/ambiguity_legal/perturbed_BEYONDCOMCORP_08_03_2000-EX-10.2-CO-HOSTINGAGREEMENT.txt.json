                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall endeavor to comply' and introducing 'reasonable efforts' weakens the obligation to protect user data. It suggests that full compliance is not strictly required, potentially conflicting with privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or other state-specific data protection laws that mandate specific data security measures and protocols.",

Co-Host will conduct its business in a manner that reflects favorably upon the Products and NAI.",
                "changed_text": "Co-Host will consider using efforts to market the Products it orders and to that end might (i) evaluate conducting marketing activities authorized by NAI, (ii) consider supporting special promotions initiated by NAI, and (iii) attempt to maintain a reasonable financial condition. Co-Host will consider conducting its business in a manner that reflects generally favorably upon the Products and NAI.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'will use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'will consider using efforts,' 'will conduct' with 'might evaluate conducting,' and weakening the requirements for financial condition and business conduct, this modification creates ambiguity about the level of marketing effort required. This is contrary to contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing. It becomes difficult to determine if Co-Host has breached this clause, as the level of effort is vaguely defined.",

                "original_text": "Co-Host will provide to NAI within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar month, a computer media data file in the format established by NAI showing, for such month, Co-Host's total sales, by customer and by Product from each location. If requested by NAI, Co-Host shall provide such reports with respect to weekly periods or bi-weekly periods prior to the end of the calendar month in which such period occurs.",
                "changed_text": "Co-Host may provide to NAI approximately within ten (10) days after the end of each calendar month, a computer media data file in a potentially similar format to that established by NAI potentially showing, for such month, Co-Host's approximate sales, potentially without specifying each customer nor each Product from each location. If requested by NAI, Co-Host could consider providing such reports with respect to weekly periods or bi-weekly periods possibly prior to the end of the calendar month in which such period occurs.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'may provide', introducing 'approximately', 'potentially similar format', 'potentially without specifying each customer', and 'could consider providing' significantly reduces the obligation to provide accurate and timely sales data. By weakening the specific reporting requirements, the ability of NAI to monitor sales accurately is compromised. This change introduces ambiguity that affects the ability of NAI to enforce the sales reporting obligation, especially if the agreement involves revenue-sharing or performance-based payments that are dependent on precise reporting metrics.",

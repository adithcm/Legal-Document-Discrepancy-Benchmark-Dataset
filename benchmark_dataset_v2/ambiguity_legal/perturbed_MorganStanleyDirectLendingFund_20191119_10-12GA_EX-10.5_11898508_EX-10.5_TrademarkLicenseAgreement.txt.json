                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Licensee shall, at its sole expense, comply at all times with all applicable Laws and reputable industry practice pertaining to the Licensee Business and Permitted Activity.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee shall endeavor to comply with applicable Laws and industry practice pertaining to the Licensee Business and Permitted Activity, to the extent reasonably practicable.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply at all times' to 'shall endeavor to comply...to the extent reasonably practicable' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This can conflict with regulations that require strict adherence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various federal and state laws, depending on the specific industry and activity, which require strict compliance and do not allow for 'reasonable practicability' as a standard.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Licensor after it becomes aware of potentially material infringement of the Brand.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'notify Licensor promptly after it becomes aware of any actual or threatened infringement' with 'use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Licensor after it becomes aware of potentially material infringement' significantly weakens the obligation. The terms 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'potentially material' are vague and open to interpretation, potentially delaying or preventing notification of infringement. This could contradict the Lanham Act, which requires trademark owners to actively protect their marks.",

                "changed_text": "Licensee acknowledges that Licensor may experience harm due to a significant breach that demonstrably damages the Brand's reputation. Licensor reserves the right to explore injunctive relief options at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modified sentence replaces 'would be irreparably harmed' with 'may experience harm,' reducing the strength of the statement. Furthermore, 'reserves the right to explore injunctive relief options at its discretion' makes seeking an injunction optional instead of a recognized right, and the removal of 'without posting bond or other security' introduces uncertainty. This weakens the licensor's ability to quickly and effectively protect its brand, potentially contravening legal principles that support immediate injunctive relief in trademark cases.",

                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, each party hereto agrees to consider joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of any filing seemingly required by such party under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, if such security is registered on a national securities exchange, also with the exchange), and further agrees to consider the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this agreement as an exhibit thereto, as deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"hereby agrees to the joint filing\" with \"agrees to consider joint filing\" weakens the obligation to file jointly. Adding \"seemingly required\" introduces ambiguity regarding whether a filing is truly necessary, and the phrase \"as deemed necessary\" adds subjectivity to the decision of whether to file, furnish, and/or incorporate the agreement, making it difficult to enforce mandatory filing requirements.",

                "original_text": "This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This agreement will generally remain in effect unless a party chooses to revoke it via written notification, although the precise implications of such revocation may vary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"shall remain in full force and effect\" with \"will generally remain in effect\" introduces uncertainty about the agreement's duration and enforceability. Substituting the defined procedure \"revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto\" with a more ambiguous \"chooses to revoke it via written notification\" creates ambiguity regarding the revocation process. Adding \"although the precise implications of such revocation may vary\" further diminishes the agreement's binding nature, making the obligations unclear and potentially non-compliant with securities regulations.",

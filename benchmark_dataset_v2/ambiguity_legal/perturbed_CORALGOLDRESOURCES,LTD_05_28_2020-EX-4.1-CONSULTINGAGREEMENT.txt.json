                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Services undertaken by the Consultant under this Agreement shall be in full compliance with all applicable laws andconsistent with a high degree of business ethics.",
                "changed_text": "The Services undertaken by the Consultant under this Agreement should generally align with applicable laws and aim for a reasonable degree of business ethics.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be in full compliance' with 'should generally align' weakens the obligation to adhere strictly to all applicable laws. Also, replacing 'consistent with a high degree of business ethics' with 'aim for a reasonable degree of business ethics' introduces subjectivity and lowers the standard, creating ambiguity. This could potentially contradict laws requiring strict compliance, such as securities regulations or environmental protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts various laws requiring strict compliance, such as securities regulations, environmental protection laws, or anti-corruption laws, depending on the specific services provided.",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant should consider exercising a degree of care, as they deem appropriate, in safeguarding the aforementioned Confidential Information, and may take steps to maintain confidentiality as practical.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall exercise a reasonable degree of care' to 'should consider exercising a degree of care, as they deem appropriate' makes the obligation to protect confidential information discretionary and subjective. Similarly, replacing 'take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure the maintenance of confidentiality' with 'may take steps to maintain confidentiality as practical' further weakens the requirement. This contradicts legal and fiduciary duties to protect confidential information, potentially violating British Columbia's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) regarding reasonable security arrangements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates British Columbia's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) regarding reasonable security arrangements for protecting personal information.",

                "changed_text": "The Consultant will endeavor to maintain records of the Works, and the Company may request access to these records at mutually agreed times. The ownership of these materials will be subject to further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the consultant to maintain adequate and current records available at all times. The revised text changes 'adequate and current written records' to simply 'records', removing the requirement for them to be adequate or current. Changing 'will be available at all times' to 'Company may request access to these records at mutually agreed times' introduces ambiguity and gives the Consultant greater control over when the Company can access the works. This creates non-compliance since 'at all times' no longer applies, and it may contradict the rights of the company to ensure data of materials can be reviewed as necessary. Finally, by noting the 'ownership of these materials will be subject to further negotiation' allows for the works to be the sole property of the consultant rather than the company. ",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Talent shall have the right of approval in respect of all Product being proposed as any part  of the Property appearing or integrated into it and all proposed use of the Property (including to whom the Property is distributed for sale if other than the general public) prior to public release and distribution.",
                "changed_text": "Talent shall have some influence in respect of all Product being proposed as any part of the Property appearing or integrated into it and all proposed use of the Property (including to whom the Property is distributed for sale if other than the general public) prior to public release and distribution.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'right of approval' with 'some influence,' the obligation is weakened. 'Some influence' is vague and doesn't specify the extent of the Talent's power or the Company's obligation to act on it. This introduces ambiguity about the Talent's actual control over the use of their property.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - Ambiguity can make a contract unenforceable or lead to disputes, especially in jurisdictions like England and Wales, where contract law requires clear terms.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Talent shall not make any request for unreasonable revisions and shall not withhold consent for any proposed use of the Property unreasonably.",
                "changed_text": "Talent shall endeavor to not make requests for revisions or withhold consent for any proposed use of the Property without due consideration.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not make any request for unreasonable revisions and shall not withhold consent for any proposed use of the Property unreasonably' to 'shall endeavor to not make requests for revisions or withhold consent for any proposed use of the Property without due consideration' significantly weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor to' and 'without due consideration' are vague and subjective terms. It is unclear what constitutes 'due consideration,' creating ambiguity and making enforcement difficult.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - The ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the clause, making it difficult to determine whether the Talent has breached the agreement under the laws of England and Wales.",
                "location": "5. d."
            },
            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company and Talent agree that they shall take all necessary steps  during the Term to protect the endorsement in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of the Product, subject always to the Company bearing any costs or liabilities in taking such steps and fully indemnifying the Talent and his agent in respect thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company and Talent agree that they may take steps during the Term to protect the endorsement in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale of the Product, subject always to the Company considering bearing any costs or liabilities in taking such steps and potentially indemnifying the Talent and his agent in respect thereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation to protect the endorsement, whereas the modified text replaces 'shall take all necessary steps' with 'may take steps,' making the action optional. Further, it swaps ‘bearing any costs or liabilities’ with 'considering bearing any costs or liabilities'. Furthermore, it replaces 'fully indemnifying the Talent' with 'potentially indemnifying the Talent,' which creates a large degree of ambiguity. This is especially problematic as the Company is based in England.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law - This change introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to protect the endorsement, which, in England and Wales, may lead to unenforceability due to lack of clear terms.",

Women.com reserves the right to reject any and all content that does not meet Women.com's editorial guidelines. eDiets will then be required to edit such 2 content until all content provided by eDiets complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines and standards. In the event that eDiets fails, within five (5) days after submission by Women.com, to provide Women.com with necessary revisions thereto, such failure shall be deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits.",

Women.com will provide eDiets with broad editorial suggestions for eDiets Content. Women.com may, at its discretion, reject content it finds unsuitable. eDiets will attempt to revise content based on Women.com's feedback.

                "explanation": "The original text states that eDiets \"shall ensure\" compliance with Women.com's editorial guidelines, which provides a definitive obligation. The modified version weakens this obligation by stating eDiets will use \"reasonable efforts\" to align with Women.com's \"general editorial preferences\". The phrase \"reasonable efforts\" is ambiguous and subjective, and \"general editorial preferences\" lacks the definiteness of \"editorial guidelines.\" Additionally, removing the penalty of \"deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits\" if eDiets fails to revise weakens the obligation.",

Substituting \"should strive not to disclose\" for \"in no event shall eDiets disclose\" significantly reduces the enforceability of the restriction on data disclosure, introducing an ambiguity.

Each party will attempt to avoid using names, marks or logos that are arguably similar to the other party's Marks.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce significant ambiguity by replacing definitive obligations with weaker, less enforceable language. Replacing \"shall be in accordance with\" to \"should endeavor to use in a manner that generally aligns with quality expectations\" changes a strict requirement into a suggestion. Similarly, changing \"agrees to refrain\" to \"should generally avoid\" reduces the commitment. Also changing \"shall bear appropriate copyright and/or trademark notices as prescribed by the other party\" to \"may include copyright and/or trademark notices, at the discretion of the preparing party\" makes trademark usage optional rather than obligatory, conflicting with the purpose of trademark law to protect brand identity. Finally, replacing \"will not use, register, or attempt to register...any name, mark or logo that is confusingly similar\" to \"will attempt to avoid using names, marks or logos that are arguably similar\" softens the obligation, changing \"confusingly similar\" into \"arguably similar\", broadening the interpretation.",

                "original_text": "eDiets shall ensure that the eDiets Content complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines. Women.com will provide eDiets with specific editorial guidelines for eDiets Content. Women.com reserves the right to reject any and all content that does not meet Women.com's editorial guidelines. eDiets will then be required to edit such content until all content provided by eDiets complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines and standards.",
                "changed_text": "eDiets shall attempt to ensure that the eDiets Content generally aligns with Women.com's editorial guidelines. Women.com will provide eDiets with general editorial suggestions for eDiets Content. Women.com reserves the right to suggest changes to any content that may not fully align with Women.com's editorial guidelines. eDiets will then be encouraged to consider edits to such content to better align with Women.com's editorial guidelines and standards.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall attempt to ensure' and 'complies' with 'generally aligns,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. The removal of 'specific' editorial guidelines eliminates a clear legal requirement, and replacing 'required to edit' with 'encouraged to consider edits' creates uncertainty about the binding nature of the edits. The change undermines the original intent of ensuring compliance, potentially leading to content disputes.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'agrees that... it shall not' with 'will endeavor to avoid' and 'reasonably necessary' with 'unnecessary'. This makes the obligation suggestive rather than mandatory, and it shifts the burden of proof to the complainant. It replaces clear language around materially affecting the information, perception, service quality, or security with an ambiguous expectation to ‘endeavor to avoid.’",

These reports may include impression numbers and other metrics for advertising categories in Exhibit B, along with information eDiets requests, depending on commercial efforts and available technology.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation for providing advertising reports. 'Shall make...available' becomes 'will attempt to provide,' making the action discretionary. 'Shall contain' becomes 'may include,' indicating the report's contents are not guaranteed. 'To the extent reasonable commercial efforts and current technology permit' is also altered, suggesting fulfilling report requests depends on effort and technology constraints, potentially limiting crucial data for eDiets.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall continuously operate' to 'will attempt to continuously operate' makes the obligation less strict and introduces discretion. Changing 'shall constitute' to 'may constitute' weakens the consequences of a failure to operate continuously, making it unclear whether it will be treated as a breach of contract. This change replaces a mandatory requirement with a discretionary and vague obligation, leaving enforcement open to interpretation.",

In particular, the Franchisee shall at all times comply with the following provisions of this Section 5.",
                "changed_text": "The Franchisee will endeavor to comply at most times with the Burger King System, which Franchisee acknowledges is generally important to this Agreement. In particular, the Franchisee should aim to comply with the following provisions of this Section 5.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces ambiguities that weaken the franchisee's obligations. Replacing 'agrees to comply strictly at all times' with 'will endeavor to comply at most times' diminishes the rigor and consistency expected in adhering to the Burger King System. Substituting 'is a fundamental term' with 'is generally important' downplays the significance of the Burger King System to the agreement. Furthermore, changing 'shall at all times comply' to 'should aim to comply' makes the subsequent provisions recommendations rather than firm requirements.",

Increased amounts may be requested by BKC.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the insurance obligation vague and potentially non-compliant with standard business practices and legal requirements. Replacing 'agrees to carry' with 'will try to carry' weakens the commitment to maintain insurance. The changes eliminate specific coverage requirements (Broad Form Contractual Liability) and introduce ambiguity about the required coverage amount.",

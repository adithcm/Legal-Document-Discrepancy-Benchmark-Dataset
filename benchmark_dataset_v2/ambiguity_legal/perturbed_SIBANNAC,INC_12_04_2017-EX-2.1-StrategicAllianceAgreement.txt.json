                "changed_text": "Bravatek may endeavor to serve as a project sales lead finder for COMPANY. In this capacity, Bravatek will attempt to provide services to COMPANY.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'agrees to serve' and 'will use its best efforts,' which creates a clear obligation. By changing it to 'may endeavor to serve' and 'will attempt to provide,' the obligation becomes ambiguous and discretionary. The terms 'endeavor' and 'attempt' don't define a specific performance standard, making it difficult to enforce.",

Utilize each other as Preferred Vendors for services whenever possible upon mutual agreement.",
                "changed_text": "COMPANY and Bravatek will consider jointly: a. Exploring a potential Product Solution and Application Strategy; b. Considering supporting each other in some technical, marketing and promotional efforts; c. Discussing a possible strategy for developing new product/services/capabilities; d. Utilizing each other as Preferred Vendors for services when convenient.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains clear obligations to 'develop and implement,' 'support each other,' 'develop a joint strategy,' and 'utilize each other.' The modified text replaces these with vague phrases like 'exploring a potential,' 'considering supporting,' 'discussing a possible strategy,' and 'when convenient.' This weakens the obligations and introduces significant ambiguity, making enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that parties 'shall treat as confidential' and 'take every reasonable precaution.' By changing it to 'should consider keeping information confidential' and 'may take precautions,' the confidentiality obligation becomes discretionary and lacks concrete enforcement mechanisms. This introduces ambiguity and undermines the legally binding aspect of the confidentiality clause.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Transporter shall be obligated to provide such minimum pressures only to the extent that capacity is reserved by Shipper and scheduled by Transporter at the Primary Delivery Point(s) described above. Such minimum pressure obligation is subject to the GT&C including, but not limited to, Article X - Excuse of Performances.",
                "changed_text": "Transporter may attempt to provide such minimum pressures to the extent that capacity is generally available. Such pressure obligations may be subject to certain undefined conditions.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall be obligated' with 'may attempt,' weakening the obligation to provide minimum pressures. It introduces vague terms like 'generally available' and 'undefined conditions', making the obligation unclear and unenforceable. This creates uncertainty around a legally binding commitment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Kentucky law requires contracts to have definite terms and obligations. The ambiguity introduced here would make it difficult to enforce the pressure requirement, potentially violating basic contract law principles regarding definiteness of obligations.",

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Shipper warrants that all upstream and downstream transportation arrangements are in place, or will be in place as of the requested effective date of service, and that it has advised the upstream and downstream transporters of the receipt and delivery points under this Agreement and any quantity limitations for each point as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto. Shipper agrees to indemnify and hold Transporter harmless for refusal to transport gas hereunder in the event any upstream or downstream transporter fails to receive or deliver gas as contemplated by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Shipper generally warrants that upstream and downstream transportation arrangements are in place or will be addressed. Shipper intends to inform the relevant parties of the agreed receipt and delivery points. Shipper might indemnify Transporter for certain failures in gas transport, as determined on a case-by-case evaluation.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'generally warrants,' 'will be addressed,' and 'intends to inform' introduce significant ambiguity. They weaken the shipper's commitment to ensure transportation arrangements are in place, and the 'might indemnify' introduces further vagueness. This could conflict with Kentucky's contract law, which requires clear and enforceable warranties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Kentucky contract law requires clear and definite terms, particularly in warranties. The ambiguity undermines the legal enforceability of the warranty, potentially violating Kentucky contract law principles.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, no modification of or supplement to the terms and provisions stated in this Agreement shall be or become effective until Shipper has submitted a request for change through PASSKEY and Shipper has been notified through PASSKEY of Transporter's agreement to such change.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise indicated, modifications may become effective after a request for change and some form of agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the specific PASSKEY process with a vague 'some form of agreement' and 'otherwise indicated' creating significant ambiguity. It is unclear how modifications will be made, rendering the process unenforceable. This creates uncertainty and legal risk, as it is not clear how agreed-upon changes will be legally documented or enforced.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Texas law, which governs this contract, modifications to contracts generally require clear mutual assent and definiteness. By making the modification process so vague, there's a risk that subsequent changes may be unenforceable due to lack of clarity on the process required for valid modifications.",

                "changed_text": "WYZZ shall endeavor to file reports and applications with the FCC or any other governmental body in what it considers a reasonably timely manner.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall file...in a timely and complete manner' to 'shall endeavor to file...in what it considers a reasonably timely manner' introduces significant ambiguity. The original text requires strict compliance with filing deadlines and completeness. The revised text makes the obligation subjective, as 'reasonably timely' is open to interpretation by WYZZ and may not align with the FCC's or other governmental bodies' actual deadlines. 'Endeavor' also weakens the mandatory nature of the original obligation.",

                "changed_text": "The facilities of WYZZ-TV will be maintained in a manner deemed suitable by WYZZ and will generally comply with the engineering requirements set forth in the FCC authorizations, permits, and licenses for WYZZ-TV, and WYZZ will attempt to ensure that WYZZ-TV broadcasts an adequate signal to its primary service area, resources permitting.",
                "explanation": "The original obligation requires strict compliance with FCC engineering standards and broadcasting a high-quality signal. The modified text introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. 'Maintained in a manner deemed suitable by WYZZ' allows WYZZ to subjectively determine the maintenance level, which may fall below industry standards or FCC requirements. 'Generally comply' weakens the requirement for compliance with FCC authorizations, permits and licenses, and 'attempt to ensure' and 'resources permitting' weaken the obligation to broadcast a high quality signal.",
                "contradicted_law": "Communications Act of 1934 and FCC regulations (47 CFR Part 73), specifically those related to technical standards for broadcasting and signal quality.",

                "explanation": "The original language specifies a clear obligation to maintain 'replacement cost casualty and liability insurance and property insurance...in such amounts and on such terms and conditions that are ordinary and customary in the broadcast industry and that are reasonably acceptable to Nexstar'. The new text introduces ambiguity by changing 'shall maintain' to 'will try to maintain some level of...', making the obligation less definitive. Replacing 'ordinary and customary' with 'it believes are adequate' makes the insurance coverage subjective. Lastly, 'Nexstar's acceptance will not be unreasonably sought' removes a layer of consent and review.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding workers compensation and general liability insurance requirements for businesses, as well as potential breach of contract if the insurance coverage is insufficient to cover losses, creating further legal complications.",

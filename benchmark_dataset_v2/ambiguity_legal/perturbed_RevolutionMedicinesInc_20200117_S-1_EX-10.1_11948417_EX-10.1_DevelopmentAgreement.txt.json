                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each Party shall perform all Development activities under this Agreement in compliance with all Applicable Law (including GMP, GLP and GCP). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, RevMed shall use diligent efforts to conduct its activities under each Development Plan in accordance with the terms of such Development Plan (including timelines), as the same may be amended from time to time (and which basis for comparison shall be tolled until any then-contemplated or pending amendments are completed or for the duration of any bona fide dispute between the Parties with respect to a Development Plan or amendment thereto), and this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should endeavor to perform all Development activities under this Agreement in general accordance with Applicable Law. Furthermore, RevMed should aim to conduct its activities under each Development Plan, considering the terms of such Development Plan, as the same may be updated. However, this does not create strict liability for failure to meet any individual requirement, timeline, or standard under such laws.",
                "explanation": "The changes introduce significant ambiguity by replacing 'shall perform' with 'should endeavor to perform' and 'in compliance with' with 'in general accordance with', making compliance optional rather than mandatory. Adding 'However, this does not create strict liability for failure to meet any individual requirement, timeline, or standard under such laws' further weakens the obligation, allowing for deviations from the legally required standards of GMP, GLP, and GCP. This directly contradicts the strict requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations, which are mandatory for pharmaceutical development under United States federal law.",

                "changed_text": "Sanofi intends to reimburse RevMed for RevMed R&D Costs that appear reasonable and customary, provided that such costs are generally aligned with the Research Budget for such activities, subject to Sanofi's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces the definite obligation 'will reimburse' with the discretionary 'intends to reimburse,' and replaces 'provided that such RevMed R&D Costs are incurred per the Research Budget' with 'generally aligned with the Research Budget, subject to Sanofi's discretion'. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the clear financial obligation defined in the original contract. The phrase 'Sanofi's discretion' could be interpreted in a way that undermines the agreements financial compensation, making it unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Consistent with [***] or as otherwise agreed by the Parties, Sanofi shall consider using efforts [***] to potentially file and seek approval for an MAA for a Product in some of such countries or in the Major Market Countries in the European Union.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts' to 'shall consider using efforts', the active obligation to exert Commercially Reasonable Efforts is weakened to a mere consideration of making efforts. The addition of 'potentially' and 'some of such countries' makes the obligation even less concrete, allowing Sanofi to opt out of filing for approval in certain key markets with minimal repercussions. This contradicts the intended meaning of Commercially Reasonable Efforts, which requires a demonstrable commitment to achieving a specific outcome.",

                "original_text": "Agent shall act solely as agent for Client under this Agreement and owes no duties hereunder to any other person. Agent undertakes to perform the duties and only the duties that are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against Agent.",
                "changed_text": "Agent shall generally act as agent for Client under this Agreement. Agent will endeavor to perform the duties set forth in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall act solely' to 'shall generally act', the obligation is weakened. Removing 'only the duties' introduces ambiguity about whether the agent might have other duties. By changing 'undertakes to perform the duties' to 'will endeavor to perform', the legal commitment is weakened, making performance discretionary rather than mandatory.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires transfer agents to fulfill their duties with a high degree of care and diligence. This change introduces ambiguity regarding the standard of care and duties, potentially violating Section 17f and Rule 17f-2 of the act, which focuses on safeguarding fund assets through clear custodial and agency responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "In connection with any question of law, Agent may, at its discretion, consult with legal counsel. Reliance on that advice may provide some protection.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the reliance the agent has when consulting legal counsel. By removing the words 'full and complete authorization', it allows the agent to choose if it wishes to rely on counsel or not.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires a prudent approach when handling legal matters. By changing the language to make the consultation of legal counsel discretionary, and weakening the protection offered by it, there is a potential breach. A prudent approach can only be achieved when taking legal advice.",

                "changed_text": "Client will consider indemnifying Agent for any loss, claim, or expense related to Agent's duties. However, if a court finds the agent negligent, indemnification may not apply.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the indemnification clause discretionary, replacing 'shall indemnify' with 'will consider indemnifying.' The wording 'may not apply' is vague and creates uncertainty about when indemnification will be provided, undermining the Agent's financial protection. The original clause provides a clearer scope for indemnification unless gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct can be proven by the court.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Investment Company Act of 1940 expects funds to provide agents with clear expectations for indemnification. Section 17(h) seeks to establish clear guidelines for liability and indemnification. The ambiguous phrasing here undermines the contractual certainty required for agents to effectively manage the risks associated with the fund's assets.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Watchit shall have the exclusive right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and will have the right to brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a \"bug\" on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "changed_text": "Watchit may have the right to sell third party advertising as sponsors of their content and can potentially brand the content under the Watchit brand and place a \"bug\" on the screen identifying the content with a Watchit trademark.",
                "explanation": "This modification replaces the definitive 'shall have the exclusive right' with the permissive 'may have the right' and 'will have the right' with 'can potentially brand'. This creates ambiguity about Watchit's actual rights, making them discretionary rather than guaranteed. This could lead to disputes over advertising revenue and brand control.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - Ambiguous terms can render a contract unenforceable or lead to interpretations unfavorable to the drafter, potentially conflicting with the intended exclusivity of advertising rights.",

                "changed_text": "Ocean Time Warner Cable will endeavor to provide Watchit with some data on viewership to Channel 777 and the content provided by Watchit, if available.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will provide' to 'will endeavor to provide' makes the provision of viewership data non-mandatory. Adding 'some data' introduces vagueness regarding the quality and comprehensiveness of the data provided. The addition of 'if available' creates a loophole, allowing Oceanic Time Warner Cable to avoid providing data altogether. This contradicts the original intent of data transparency, hindering Watchit's ability to assess the effectiveness of their content and advertising strategies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - If the viewership data is crucial for Watchit to fulfill its obligations or assess the contract's value, the ambiguity introduced here could lead to a claim of breach of contract due to a failure to provide essential information.",

                "changed_text": "Oceanic Time Warner Cable may, at their discretion, not include content they generally find unsuitable.",
                "explanation": "The original clause, while poorly worded, grants Oceanic Time Warner Cable the right to exclude content deemed 'inappropriate or distasteful.' Modifying it to 'may, at their discretion, not include content they generally find unsuitable' introduces subjectivity and broadens the scope of exclusion. The term 'generally find unsuitable' is vague and allows Oceanic Time Warner Cable to reject content based on unclear or evolving standards, potentially hindering Watchit's ability to provide content as agreed upon.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law - This change introduces ambiguity around what constitutes 'generally unsuitable' content. This could lead to disputes and potentially a breach of contract claim if Watchit believes Oceanic Time Warner Cable is unfairly rejecting content.",

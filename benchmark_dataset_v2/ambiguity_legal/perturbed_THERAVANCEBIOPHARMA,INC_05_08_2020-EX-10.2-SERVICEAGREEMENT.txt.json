                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "4.2.1 devote the whole of their working time, attention and abilities to the business of the Company and any other Group Company for which the Executive is required to work from time to time;",
                "changed_text": "4.2.1 devote a significant portion of their working time, attention and abilities to the business of the Company and any other Group Company for which the Executive is reasonably required to work from time to time;",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'the whole of their working time' with 'a significant portion' introduces ambiguity. It's unclear what constitutes a 'significant portion,' potentially leading to disputes about whether the executive is meeting their obligations. The addition of 'reasonably required' also makes it harder to objectively determine the expectations of the job duties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Working Time Regulations 1998 - Regulation 4 states limits weekly working time. The wording introduced here is vague and can be exploited as a loophole.",

Expenses The Company shall reimburse any reasonable travel expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the Executive in the proper performance of the Executive's duties under this Agreement subject always to the rules and policies of the Company from time to time and subject to the Executive providing receipts or other evidence of payment as the Company may require.",
                "changed_text": "8. Expenses The Company may reimburse travel expenses incurred by the Executive as it sees fit, subject to vaguely defined internal guidelines. The Executive should provide documentation of payment, where feasible.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall reimburse' to 'may reimburse as it sees fit' makes expense reimbursement discretionary rather than mandatory. Describing the internal policies as 'vaguely defined' creates further ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the Executive's entitlement to expense reimbursement. Changing 'shall provide receipts' to 'should provide documentation' removes the requirement to do so.",
                "contradicted_law": "UK employment law requires employers to reimburse reasonable expenses. This weakens the commitment.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should attempt to protect' and 'shall use best endeavours' with 'should consider taking steps' weakens the obligation to maintain confidentiality. It replaces a mandatory obligation with a suggestion, making enforcement difficult. ",

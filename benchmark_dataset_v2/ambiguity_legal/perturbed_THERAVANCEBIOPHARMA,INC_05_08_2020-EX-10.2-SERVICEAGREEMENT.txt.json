                "explanation": "The original text mandates the employee to devote their 'whole' working time, attention and abilities. The modified text weakens this obligation by stating 'a significant amount', making it ambiguous and difficult to enforce. 'Significant amount' is subjective and does not define the exact percentage or hours to be devoted, potentially leading to disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Working Time Regulations 1998 (UK). While Regulation 4 is waived in 6.2, the inherent duty to ensure adequate rest and prevent overwork is undermined by the ambiguity of 'significant amount'.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the company 'shall reimburse' reasonable expenses. The modified text changes this to 'will consider reimbursing some travel expenses,' making reimbursement discretionary. Further ambiguity is introduced by 'internal guidelines' (unstated) and 'documentation that may or may not be required,' giving the company excessive leeway in denying legitimate expense claims.",

Obligations Upon Termination\n20.1 On Termination or, if earlier, at the start of a period of Garden Leave following the service of notice or purported Termination by the Executive, the Executive shall:\n20.1.1 immediately deliver to the Company all documents, books, materials, records, correspondence, papers, Copies, Confidential Information and other business information (on whatever media and wherever located) relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company or its business contacts, any keys and any other property of any Group Company, which is in the Executive's possession or control;\n20.1.2 irretrievably delete any information relating to the business of any Group Company stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory (including on any personal computer, personal device, personal email account or web account), and all matter derived from such sources which is in their possession or under their control outside the premises of the Company;\n20.1.3 provide such handover of their duties as the Company shall consider appropriate; and\n20.1.4 provide a signed statement confirming full compliance with the obligations under clauses 20.1.1 and 20.1.2 together with such reasonable evidence of compliance as the Company may request.",

Obligations Upon Termination\n20.1 On Termination or, if earlier, at the start of a period of Garden Leave following the service of notice or purported Termination by the Executive, the Executive should:\n20.1.1 promptly return most of the Company's documents, to the extent feasible, relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company;\n20.1.2 endeavor to delete Company information where practical;\n20.1.3 provide a handover of duties as they understand them to be required; and\n20.1.4 provide a statement regarding their compliance, if requested.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses the imperative 'shall,' creating a clear legal obligation. The modified text uses weaker, ambiguous language like 'should', 'most of,' 'to the extent feasible,' 'endeavor,' and 'as they understand them to be required.' These changes make the obligations vague and unenforceable. It is unclear what 'most of' means regarding document return, what is 'feasible' for deletion, or what constitutes an adequate handover. It contradicts the original intentions of securing business information.",

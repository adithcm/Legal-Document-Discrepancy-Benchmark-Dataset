                "changed_text": "The rights and obligations of the Farids Group and the Company may be terminated under certain circumstances. The rights of the Farids Group to appoint the Director Designee and the Company to nominate the Director Designee may cease if the Farids Group owns less than 5.0% of the Common Stock. Additionally, such rights and obligations might terminate based on the EA Revenue for specific contract years, as determined in a manner the Company deems reasonable. The specifics of such termination are subject to the Company's interpretation.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides clear conditions for the termination of the Nomination Right. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the rights 'may be terminated under certain circumstances' without clearly defining those circumstances. The added phrase 'as determined in a manner the Company deems reasonable' allows the Company subjective discretion, contradicting the need for clear and objective criteria for board nominations, potentially disenfranchising shareholder rights.",

The Farids Group agrees that in connection with any Transfer of Purchased Shares that is not made pursuant to a registration statement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, request an opinion, certifications and other information in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company stating that such transaction is exempt from registration under the Securities Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will generally try to avoid actions that permit transfers of purchased shares unless compliant with this agreement and securities laws. However, the Company's responsibility in preventing non-compliant transfers is limited to actions it deems feasible. Furthermore, for transfers outside a registration statement, the Company reserves the right to request opinions and certifications it finds generally acceptable, without a strict obligation to ensure their accuracy or legal soundness.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to prevent non-compliant share transfers. Replacing 'will not take any action' with 'will generally try to avoid actions' makes the commitment less firm. Introducing 'limited to actions it deems feasible' provides an ambiguous out for the Company. Similarly, replacing 'reasonably satisfactory' with 'it finds generally acceptable, without a strict obligation to ensure their accuracy or legal soundness' weakens the due diligence required, creating potential non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Here, the original obligation of the Company to 'effect such registration' is weakened by making the decision to proceed with registration entirely discretionary ('If the Company determines, at its sole discretion, that it should proceed'). The language 'will attempt to facilitate' and 'will attempt to cooperate' replaces 'shall effect' and 'shall cooperate,' making the obligation less binding. The phrase 'as reasonably as it sees fit' introduces further ambiguity and discretion, potentially undermining the registration rights intended for the Farids Group.",

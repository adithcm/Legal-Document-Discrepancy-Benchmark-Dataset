                "original_text": "Mobimagic warrants that it will not take any action, or collect any data, which causes a breach of applicable law or PC Financial'& privacy policy and consent driven architecture. Subject to the foregoing as wen as Mobimagic's obligations under this Agreement, Mobimagic shall not in any manner be held or be responsible or liable for any unforeseen contingency, claims, liabilities, demands. losses, damages or expenses arising due to absence of storage or retention of any PC Financial data which shall be the sole responsibility of PC Financial .",
                "changed_text": "Mobimagic will endeavor to avoid any action or data collection that may potentially conflict with applicable law or PC Financial's privacy policy. Subject to the foregoing, Mobimagic's responsibility for unforeseen contingencies, claims, liabilities, demands, losses, damages or expenses arising from the absence of storage or retention of PC Financial data will be limited to reasonable efforts, with PC Financial primarily responsible.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Mobimagic 'warrants' it will not breach applicable law. This has been weakened to 'endeavor to avoid,' making compliance discretionary. The original text clearly stated that PC Financial is solely responsible for absence of storage, but the change text has 'PC Financial primarily responsible'. This change introduces ambiguity and reduces Mobimagic's legal obligation, potentially conflicting with obligations for data protection under Indian law.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates 'appropriate technical and organizational measures'. The modified text introduces subjectivity with 'steps it considers reasonable' and 'taking into account available resources.' This weakens the obligation and could lead to insufficient data protection measures, contravening Indian data protection laws.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that RBI 'has right to access and inspect'. The modified text changes this to 'may request access and inspection,' weakening the RBI's right to access. This makes it less clear that the companies have to automatically comply with any audits/ access request from RBI under the Indian banking and finance laws, introducing ambiguity.",

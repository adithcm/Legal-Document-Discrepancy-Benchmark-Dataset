                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Reseller shall: (a) not do or omit to do, nor authorize any third party to do or omit to do, any act or omission that would or might invalidate or be inconsistent with any of Supplier's intellectual property rights; (b) promptly notify Supplier of any actual, threatened, or suspected infringement of any of Supplier's intellectual property rights that comes to Reseller's notice; and (c) at Supplier's request and expense, do all such things as may be reasonably required to assist Supplier in taking or resisting any proceedings in relation to any such infringement or claim.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller should, when practical: (a) endeavor not to do or omit to do, nor authorize any third party to do or omit to do, any act or omission that could potentially invalidate or be inconsistent with Supplier's intellectual property rights; (b) inform Supplier of any actual, threatened, or suspected infringement of Supplier's intellectual property rights that Reseller becomes generally aware of; and (c) at Supplier's request and with shared expense, attempt to assist Supplier in certain proceedings related to infringement or claim.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce ambiguity by replacing 'shall' with 'should, when practical' and 'endeavor,' softening the obligation to protect intellectual property. 'Promptly notify' becomes 'inform when generally aware,' reducing the urgency and scope of reporting. 'Reasonably required' is replaced with 'attempt to assist in certain proceedings' adding conditions that weakens the obligation to assist in legal matters, this creates uncertainty about the reseller's responsibilities regarding intellectual property protection and could lead to disputes over their level of commitment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal laws on intellectual property protection, which require a clear and enforceable obligation to protect IP rights.",

                "original_text": "Reseller shall ensure that the Products are delivered with appropriate information and documentation, and shall not make any changes to the Products or to the packaging or labeling thereof, or to the legal documents included in the Products' packages, without Supplier's prior written consent (subject to the right of the Reseller to make changes to such materials as are described in Section 2.4). Reseller shall ensure traceability of the delivered Products.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller will try to ensure the Products are delivered with generally appropriate information and documentation, and may consider making certain changes to the Products or to the packaging or labeling thereof, or to the legal documents included in the Products' packages, based on its own discretion. Reseller will take steps to encourage traceability of the delivered Products.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement for delivering products with appropriate information and documentation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'will try to ensure' and 'generally appropriate'. The strict prohibition against making changes to products, packaging, or documentation without Supplier's consent is made discretionary with 'may consider making certain changes...based on its own discretion,' and the clear obligation to 'ensure traceability' becomes a vague 'take steps to encourage traceability.' This creates a vague standard that introduces uncertainty about the reseller's duty to maintain correct product information and traceability. In addition, the discretion to make changes to the documentation can violate FDA (Food and Drug Administration) regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "FDA regulations on product labeling and traceability for medical devices (assuming Walabot HOME is considered one), which require strict adherence to labeling and documentation standards and robust traceability systems.",

                "original_text": "Each of Reseller and Supplier will, respectively, ensure that it and its employees, agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on its behalf or for its benefit, shall comply with the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 et seq.) and any analogous anti-bribery and anti-corruption law, rule, regulation that may apply to any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including but not limited to in connection with the sale, resale, import, export, transportation, or shipment of the Products. Neither party to this Agreement will make any payment, directly or indirectly, of money or other assets, including but not limited to compensation derived from this Agreement or any Order placed under it, to government or political party officials, officials of international organizations, candidates for public office, or representatives of other businesses or persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing, that would constitute a violation of any law, rule, or regulation.",
                "changed_text": "Each of Reseller and Supplier will, respectively, endeavor to ensure that it and its employees, agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on its behalf or for its benefit, generally complies with the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 et seq.) and analogous anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, rules, regulations. Neither party to this Agreement intends to make any payment, directly or indirectly, that it knows would violate anti-corruption laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'ensure that it...shall comply' to 'endeavor to ensure that it...generally complies' weakens the commitment to full compliance with the FCPA. 'Will not make any payment...that would constitute a violation' is softened to 'Neither party...intends to make any payment...that it knows would violate anti-corruption laws,' introducing a subjective knowledge standard and potentially allowing for willful ignorance. This introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to actively avoid bribery.",
                "contradicted_law": "The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which requires strict compliance and prohibits any corrupt payments regardless of intent if the company is aware of the potential violation.",

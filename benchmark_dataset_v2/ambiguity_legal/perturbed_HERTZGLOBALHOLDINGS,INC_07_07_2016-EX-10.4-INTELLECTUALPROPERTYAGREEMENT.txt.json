                "original_text": "HERC shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense, from a qualified AAA-rated insurance company, a standard liability insurance and business interruption policy along with advertising injury protection, all of which must be acceptable to THC and HSI, and which must name THC and HSI as additional insureds. Such policy shall provide, in addition to other protection, protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim. The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage. HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement. In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",
                "changed_text": "HERC shall endeavor, throughout the term of this Agreement, to obtain and maintain insurance coverage. The specific types and amounts of coverage will be determined at HERC's discretion, considering market conditions and perceived risk. While HERC intends to name THC and HSI as additional insureds, this is subject to the availability of suitable policies and the agreement of the insurance provider. HERC will attempt to provide notice to THC and HSI in the event of significant modifications, cancellation, or termination of the coverage, when feasible. HERC will provide Certificates of Insurance to THC and HSI, if reasonably possible.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities. Replacing 'shall obtain and maintain' with 'shall endeavor' weakens the obligation. Specifying that the coverage will be 'determined at HERC's discretion' makes the insurance requirement subjective. Stating that naming THC and HSI as additional insureds is 'subject to availability' creates uncertainty. Limiting the notification obligation to 'when feasible' makes it discretionary. Removing the minimum coverage and the requirement for a AAA-rated insurance company makes the obligation extremely vague. This contradicts standard business practices and could potentially violate fiduciary duties.",

                "original_text": "In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a possible breach of this Agreement or related agreements, THC or HSI might consider notifying HERC and possibly terminating the Agreement, contingent upon their assessment. If HERC makes a good-faith effort to address any concerns raised within a reasonable timeframe, termination may not occur. However, should THC or HSI perceive that the situation warrants immediate action, they retain the option to terminate the Agreement without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "This paragraph introduces multiple ambiguities. Replacing 'material breach' with 'possible breach' and 'may notify' with 'might consider notifying' makes the obligation to act on a breach uncertain. The term 'good-faith effort' is vague and subjective. Defining a timeframe to cure the breach as 'reasonable' rather than a specific period of time further increases the ambiguity, and the language that they 'retain the option to terminate the Agreement without prior notice' can violate established legal protocols for contract terminations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract law; potentially violates principles of good faith and fair dealing, which are implied in contracts under New York law.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a clear obligation for cooperation. The modified text weakens this obligation by using the phrase 'aim to consider cooperating,' which makes the cooperation discretionary rather than mandatory. The phrase 'where practical' introduces further ambiguity, as it is unclear what constitutes 'practical' cooperation. The addition of 'as they each individually deem appropriate' allows each party to unilaterally decide the level of cooperation, further undermining the original obligation. This weakens the responsibility of the parties to protect the relevant trademarks. The Lanham Act requires trademark holders to actively police their marks to prevent genericide or dilution.",

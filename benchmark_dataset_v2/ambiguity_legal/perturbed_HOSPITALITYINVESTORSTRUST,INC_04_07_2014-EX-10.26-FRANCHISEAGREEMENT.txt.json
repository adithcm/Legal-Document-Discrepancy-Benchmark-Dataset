                "changed_text": "You will generally cooperate with our representatives during inspections. You will attempt to correct deficiencies within a reasonable time.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires franchisees to 'take all steps necessary' to correct deficiencies within set times. The modified text changes this to 'attempt to correct deficiencies within a reasonable time,' weakening the obligation and introducing ambiguity. 'Reasonable time' is subjective and allows for disputes about compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could potentially conflict with health and safety regulations that require prompt and specific corrective actions.",

You will not begin using the materials until we approve them. You must immediately discontinue your use of any advertising or promotional material we disapprove, even if we previously approved the materials;",
                "changed_text": "You may submit to us for our consideration samples of advertising and promotional materials not previously approved before you produce or distribute them. You may use the materials unless we explicitly disapprove them. You may, if practical, discontinue your use of any advertising or promotional material we disapprove.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the control the franchisor has over advertising. 'May submit for consideration' is less stringent than 'must submit for approval.' The franchisee can use materials unless 'explicitly disapproved,' shifting responsibility to the franchisor, and 'if practical' makes discontinuing disapproved material discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could lead to non-compliance with advertising standards or brand guidelines that require strict adherence and pre-approval, thus diluting brand reputation.",

                "changed_text": "You should strive to maintain performance scores for quality assurance programs we establish.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'must maintain minimum performance Standards' to 'should strive to maintain performance scores' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. 'Strive' is subjective and does not guarantee compliance, potentially leading to inconsistent service quality.",

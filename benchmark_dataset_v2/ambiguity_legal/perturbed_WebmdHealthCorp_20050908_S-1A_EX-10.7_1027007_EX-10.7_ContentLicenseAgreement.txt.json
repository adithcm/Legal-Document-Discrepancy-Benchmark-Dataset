                "explanation": "Changing 'may not change the substance...without WebMD's written approval' to 'should strive to avoid significantly altering the substance...without WebMD's consultation' introduces ambiguity. 'Strive to avoid significantly altering' is subjective and unenforceable. Consultation lacks the binding power of written approval.",

While this contract doesn't explicitly violate copyright, the ambiguous language weakens WebMD's control over its content, potentially leading to unauthorized derivative works without clear legal recourse. The original clause protected WebMD's copyright more effectively. Copyright law protects the original creator from having their work altered without permission.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall promptly notify' to 'shall endeavor to notify...when feasible' introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation. 'Endeavor' implies effort but not a guarantee, and 'when feasible' provides a broad exception.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law, Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. This modification weakens the duty of good faith in providing updates. While not a direct violation, it creates a loophole that allows WebMD to avoid providing updates, potentially impacting the value of the license to Emdeon. Every contract has an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, implying parties will act honestly.",

'Commercially reasonable efforts' is subjective, 'may have been replaced' is uncertain, and a 'potentially accessible link' isn't guaranteed to work.",

By weakening the obligation to provide accurate and up-to-date information, this change could potentially increase Emdeon's liability for providing outdated or incorrect medical information. The original clause provided a clearer standard for maintaining accurate content. It makes it harder to hold them liable for providing outdated information.",

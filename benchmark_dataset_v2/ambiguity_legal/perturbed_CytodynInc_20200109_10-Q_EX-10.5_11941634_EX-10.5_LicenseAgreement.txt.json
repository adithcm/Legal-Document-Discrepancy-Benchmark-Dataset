                "original_text": "CytoDyn shall conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and contractors conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a good scientific manner and in material compliance with Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines.",
                "changed_text": "CytoDyn will endeavor to conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and will encourage its Affiliates and contractors to conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a generally acceptable manner, with consideration given to Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to conduct activities in 'material compliance' with applicable law to 'consideration given' to applicable law and replaces 'good scientific manner' with 'generally acceptable manner,' introducing ambiguity and making the standard of compliance vague. This fails to meet the stringent requirements for clinical trials and development as outlined by the FDA.",

The Promotional Materials used by Vyera or its Affiliates or sublicensees in the Territory shall be consistent with the Regulatory Approval in the Territory and shall in any event comply in all material respects with Applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "Vyera will consider making its core Promotional Materials available to CytoDyn for informational purposes, and Vyera will strive for the Promotional Materials used by Vyera or its Affiliates or sublicensees in the Territory to align with the Regulatory Approval in the Territory and Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement for CytoDyn to review the Promotional Materials prior to usage. The change also replaces 'shall comply in all material respects' with 'strive for alignment', weakening the legal obligation to ensure compliance with applicable law. This creates ambiguity and could lead to promotional activities that are inconsistent with FDA regulations and labeling requirements.",

                "original_text": "CytoDyn shall be responsible for all adverse event reporting, including any and all Serious Adverse Events with respect to all Licensed Products for all indications in the Territory. CytoDyn shall maintain the unified worldwide adverse event database for the Licensed Products. Within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date the Parties will enter into the Pharmacovigilance Agreement, setting forth guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recording, review, post-marketing surveillance, communication, reporting and exchange between the Parties of adverse event reports, technical complaints and any other information concerning the safety of the Licensed Products.",
                "changed_text": "CytoDyn will generally handle adverse event reporting, including Serious Adverse Events, as they deem necessary with respect to Licensed Products in the Territory. CytoDyn will consider maintaining an adverse event database for the Licensed Products. The Parties will discuss potentially entering into a Pharmacovigilance Agreement, describing possible guidelines and procedures for the exchange of information on adverse events.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the obligation by changing 'shall be responsible' to 'will generally handle', making the reporting process discretionary. It also changes 'shall maintain' to 'will consider maintaining' and the agreement to enter into a Pharmacovigilance Agreement to simply 'discuss potentially entering into a Pharmacovigilance Agreement', reducing the commitment to a mere discussion. This is contrary to FDA regulations regarding mandatory adverse event reporting.",

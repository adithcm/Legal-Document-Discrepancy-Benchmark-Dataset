                "explanation": "The term 'endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. It is unclear what actions constitute an 'endeavor,' leading to difficulty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'shall transmit' with 'shall reasonably attempt to transmit' and 'may be permitted' with 'may be generally permitted', the obligation to transmit credit data is weakened. The term 'reasonably attempt' is vague and undefined, making it difficult to determine the extent of TrueLink's responsibility. Similarly, 'generally permitted' is ambiguous and doesn't provide a clear standard for data transmission.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall perform with the same degree of care, skill and prudence customarily exercised by it for its own operations' to 'shall attempt to perform... with a reasonable degree of care' weakens the obligation. The standard 'attempt to perform' is less stringent, and 'reasonable degree of care' lacks the specific reference to TrueLink's own customary practices, creating ambiguity.",

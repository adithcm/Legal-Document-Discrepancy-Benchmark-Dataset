                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree that a Schedule 13G/A, regarding the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, may be, and amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned, could be, filed on behalf of each of us as generally consistent with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'is' and 'shall be' with 'may be' and 'could be', the mandatory nature of filing the Schedule 13G/A and its amendments is weakened. Also, replacing 'pursuant to and in accordance with' to 'as generally consistent with' introduces vagueness. This casts doubt on whether the parties are definitively committed to fulfilling the obligations of Rule 13d-1(k).",

                "explanation": "Several terms are made vague. 'Hereby agree' becomes 'generally agree'. The shares are less well-defined. 'Dated as of December 31, 2019' becomes 'dated around December 31, 2019'. 'Shall be' becomes 'may be', and 'pursuant to and in accordance with' becomes 'in a manner consistent with'. This significantly weakens and introduces ambiguity regarding the obligation to accurately and completely file Schedule 13G/A according to the rules.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Company shall ensure that all of its personnel involved in the activities set forth under this Agreement comply with all applicable Laws and the Promotion Rules. Company shall ensure that the Sales Representatives and Other Company Employees Promote the Product at all times in accordance with applicable Laws and the Promotional Materials provided and approved by Janssen, refrain from making any false or misleading statements about the Product and refrain from discussing any unapproved uses of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "Company should endeavor to ensure that its personnel involved in the activities set forth under this Agreement comply with applicable Laws and Promotion Rules. Company should endeavor to ensure that the Sales Representatives and Other Company Employees Promote the Product in a manner generally aligned with applicable Laws and the Promotional Materials provided and approved by Janssen, try to avoid making overtly false or misleading statements about the Product, and generally avoid discussing unapproved uses of the Product.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces mandatory 'shall ensure' with the weaker 'should endeavor to ensure,' reducing the obligation to a mere attempt. The terms 'generally aligned with', 'try to avoid' and 'generally avoid' introduce ambiguity, making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This contradicts the stringent requirements of FDA regulations regarding pharmaceutical promotion and the prohibition of off-label marketing.",

Company shall at all times ensure that each Sales Representative and Other Company Employee (including Sales Representatives and Other Company Employee that are engaged after Launch Date) has received the Product- Specific Training and any other training set forth in the Training Activities Plan.",

Company should encourage each Sales Representative and Other Company Employee (including Sales Representatives and Other Company Employees that are engaged after Launch Date) to receive the Product-Specific Training and other training as generally described in the Training Activities Plan.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the training requirement. 'Shall conduct' is replaced with 'will provide', shifting the responsibility from ensuring completion to merely offering training. Replacing 'shall at all times ensure' with 'should encourage' and 'set forth' with 'as generally described' makes training discretionary and vague, undermining the mandatory training requirements often stipulated by regulatory bodies for pharmaceutical product promotion.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the commitment to compliance. Replacing 'represents and warrants that it has established' with 'represents that it has generally endeavored to establish' introduces ambiguity and reduces the strength of the warranty. The terms 'intended to be reasonably truthful and accurate' and 'broadly compliant' make the obligation subjective and vague, potentially conflicting with the strict requirements of advertising laws and regulations.",

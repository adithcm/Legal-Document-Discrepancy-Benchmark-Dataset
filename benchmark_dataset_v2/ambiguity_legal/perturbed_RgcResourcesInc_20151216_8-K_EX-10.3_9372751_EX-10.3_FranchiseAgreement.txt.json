                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Grantee shall during the term of this Franchise maintain at least one business office within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per week for the conduct of business between Grantee and its customers.",
                "changed_text": "Grantee shall endeavor to maintain a business presence within the Territorial Limits of Grantor. Such presence should generally be available during normal business hours.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a business office open for 40 hours a week. The modified text replaces this with 'endeavor to maintain a business presence' and 'should generally be available,' making the obligation vague. 'Business presence' is undefined, and 'normal business hours' are subjective. This change weakens the legal obligation to maintain a physical office with specific operating hours.",
                "contradicted_law": "Virginia law may require specific accessibility provisions for utility services; this vague language undermines the ability to enforce those provisions.",

                "changed_text": "Grantee should strive to avoid discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment, except where it is believed there is a business-related justification.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall not discriminate' with 'should strive to avoid discrimination' weakens the prohibition. Furthermore, changing 'bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Grantee' to 'believed there is a business-related justification' introduces significant ambiguity. The term 'believed' makes the exception subjective and difficult to challenge, opening the door to potential discriminatory practices not justified by legitimate business needs.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts Virginia's anti-discrimination laws, which require strict adherence and objective justification for any differential treatment, rather than subjective belief.",

                "changed_text": "All notices related to this Agreement may be provided in writing. While certified mail is acceptable, other methods of communication may also be considered sufficient.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear method for delivering notices (certified mail or overnight courier). The modified version makes the process vague by stating that while certified mail is 'acceptable,' other methods may also be considered sufficient. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes valid notice, potentially leading to disputes about whether proper notification was given.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could violate Virginia's legal standards for providing notice, especially in cases where statutes require specific notification methods to ensure due process.",

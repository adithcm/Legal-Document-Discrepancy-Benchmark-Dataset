                "original_text": "VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within thirty (30) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "VS should endeavor to submit invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees, generally in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Invoices should ideally be submitted to PPD within a reasonable timeframe of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD will consider payment for Services performed or expenses incurred which are invoiced to PPD, subject to its internal review processes.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates monthly invoicing within 30 days. The modified text weakens this obligation by using vague language such as 'should endeavor,' 'generally in accordance,' 'reasonable timeframe,' and 'will consider payment,' which introduces ambiguity. This makes the invoicing and payment terms less enforceable.",

                "changed_text": "VS represents and warrants that it shall endeavor to utilize independent discretion and judgment in discharging its responsibilities in a generally timely, professional, and workmanlike manner, and shall strive to: (i) use individuals with what it considers appropriate training and skill to perform its duties; (ii) maintain facilities, resources, and personnel it deems reasonably necessary; and (iii) make reasonable efforts to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens VS's responsibilities. Replacing 'shall utilize' with 'shall endeavor,' 'at all times' with implying flexibility, 'suitable training and skill' with 'what it considers appropriate,' 'necessary facilities' with 'it deems reasonably necessary,' and 'comply with all applicable laws' with 'make reasonable efforts to comply' introduces substantial ambiguity and makes it difficult to enforce specific standards of performance and compliance.",

VS shall cooperate with any internal reviews or audits by PPD or Sponsor (or its and their representatives) and shall make available for examination and duplication, during normal business hours and at mutually agreeable times, all documentation, data and information relating to this Agreement or any Work Order.",

VS should consider cooperating with internal reviews or audits by PPD or Sponsor and should endeavor to make available for examination, when feasible, documentation and data relating to this Agreement or any Work Order, subject to VS's confidentiality obligations.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on VS to maintain records and cooperate with audits. The modified text weakens this by replacing 'shall maintain' with 'should generally maintain,' limiting the scope to a 'reasonable extent.' Furthermore, replacing 'shall cooperate' with 'should consider cooperating' and adding 'when feasible' and 'subject to VS's confidentiality obligations' creates significant ambiguity, making it more difficult for PPD to enforce audit rights and access to necessary information.",

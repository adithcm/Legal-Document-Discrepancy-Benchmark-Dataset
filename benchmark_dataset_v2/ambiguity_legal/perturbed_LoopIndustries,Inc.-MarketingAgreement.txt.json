                "original_text": "Joint Venture Company shall fulfill all sales of Products under all Transferred Contracts, shall invoice Authorized Customers for all sales of Products under all Transferred Contracts, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the amounts due under such invoices. At Joint Venture Company's request from time to time, Loop shall provide reasonable assistance to Joint Venture Company in such invoicing and collection process at Joint Venture Company's expense.",
                "changed_text": "Joint Venture Company will attempt to fulfill sales of Products under all Transferred Contracts, may invoice Authorized Customers for all sales of Products under all Transferred Contracts, and will consider using commercially reasonable efforts to collect the amounts due under such invoices. Loop may provide assistance to Joint Venture Company in such invoicing and collection process at an agreed-upon expense.",
                "explanation": "The change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall fulfill' with 'will attempt,' making fulfillment discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'shall invoice' with 'may invoice' makes invoicing optional. Altering 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' to 'will consider using commercially reasonable efforts' makes the effort discretionary rather than obligatory, undermining the enforceability of the collection process. Removing the phrase 'Joint Venture Company's request from time to time' creates further ambiguity about the conditions under which Loop should provide assistance.",

                "original_text": "Each Party shall treat as confidential (as set forth herein) all Confidential Information of the other Party, and shall not use such Confidential Information except as contemplated in this Agreement or as otherwise authorized in writing. Each Party shall implement reasonable procedures to prohibit the unauthorized disclo-sure or misuse of the other Party's Confidential Information and shall not intentionally disclose such Confidential Information to any third party except as may be necessary or useful in connection with the rights and obligations of such Party under this Agreement, and subject to confidentiality obligations similar to those set forth in this Article 4. Each of the Parties shall use at least the same procedures and degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other Party under this Agreement, but in no event less than reasonable care.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party should attempt to treat as confidential all Confidential Information of the other Party, and may use such Confidential Information as it deems necessary. Each Party may implement procedures to discourage the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the other Party's Confidential Information and will try not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party unless it considers it necessary or useful. Each of the Parties will endeavor to use the same procedures and degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information, but no specific level of care is guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the confidentiality obligations. 'Shall treat as confidential' becomes the less binding 'should attempt to treat as confidential.' 'Shall not use' is softened to 'may use as it deems necessary,' introducing subjectivity and discretion. 'Shall implement reasonable procedures' is replaced with 'may implement procedures to discourage,' making the implementation of security measures optional. The removal of the 'confidentiality obligations similar to those set forth in this Article 4' clause means there isn't a guideline of the level of care that must be taken. Replacing 'shall use at least the same procedures and degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other Party under this Agreement, but in no event less than reasonable care' with 'will endeavor to use the same procedures and degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information, but no specific level of care is guaranteed' makes the standard of care vague and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement may be addressed in accordance with Section 13.11 of the LLC Agreement, to the extent applicable; provided that each reference to \"Party\" might be deemed a Party hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces significant ambiguity and weakens the dispute resolution process. 'Shall be finally settled' is replaced with 'may be addressed,' making the stipulated dispute resolution mechanism optional. The phrase 'to the extent applicable' adds uncertainty, implying that Section 13.11 of the LLC Agreement might not always apply. Changing 'shall be deemed' to 'might be deemed' casts doubt on whether the definition of 'Party' in the LLC Agreement applies to this agreement, potentially creating confusion about who is bound by the dispute resolution provisions. This would mean the method of conflict resolution is at the discretion of the Parties and not binding.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law, which favor clear and binding dispute resolution mechanisms. The lack of a clear mechanism undermines the enforceability of the entire agreement.",

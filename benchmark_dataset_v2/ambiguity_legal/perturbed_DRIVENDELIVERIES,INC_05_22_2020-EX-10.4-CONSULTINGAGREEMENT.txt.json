                "explanation": "The revised text introduces significant ambiguity by replacing definitive statements with weaker, more discretionary language. \"Shall\" is replaced with \"may,\" \"should consider,\" and \"might,\" making the consultant's obligations unclear and unenforceable. The phrases \"generally provide,\" \"potentially including,\" \"reasonable level,\" \"from time to time,\" and \"some matters\" add further vagueness. This contradicts basic contract law principles requiring clarity and certainty of obligations, particularly concerning the scope and nature of the services to be rendered. This can cause non-compliance due to the ambiguity.",

Consultant will generally not (i) use the Confidential Information for purposes other than the performance of the Services on behalf of the Company, or (ii) disclose the Confidential Information to any third party if practical without the consent of an authorized representative of Company.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the confidentiality clause by replacing 'hold in the strictest confidence' with 'endeavor to hold in confidence,' and by replacing 'take all reasonable precautions' with 'take precautions to a reasonable extent.' Furthermore, changing 'will not' to 'will generally not' and adding 'if practical' to the disclosure clause makes compliance discretionary. These modifications introduce ambiguity, allowing for multiple interpretations and reducing the enforceability of the confidentiality obligations. This may lead to non-compliance.",

The records will be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, electronic files, reports, or any other format that is customary in the industry and/or otherwise specified by the Company.

The records could be in various forms. Such records are the property of the Company, and upon Company's general request, Consultant will attempt to deliver them.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to keep and maintain adequate, current, accurate, and authentic written records' with 'will try to maintain records.' Replacing 'for a period of three (3) years thereafter' with 'for a reasonable time' and removing specific record formats reduces the clarity of the obligation. Changing 'upon Company's request, Consultant shall deliver' to 'upon Company's general request, Consultant will attempt to deliver' further weakens the requirement. The phrases 'try to maintain,' 'a reasonable time,' and 'attempt to deliver' create uncertainty and reduce the enforceability of this record-keeping obligation, which is crucial for protecting intellectual property rights. This may also lead to non-compliance.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Each party shall comply with all laws, regulations and ordinances in dealing with each other and with third parties, and in performing their respective obligations under this Agreement. Each party shall refrain from engaging in any unfair or deceptive trade practice or unethical business practice that could unfavorably reflect upon the other party and its products or services.",
                "changed_text": "Each party should endeavor to comply with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances when dealing with each other and with third parties, and when performing their respective obligations under this Agreement. Each party should attempt to refrain from engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices or unethical business practices if it could unfavorably reflect upon the other party and its products or services.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that each party *shall* comply with laws and refrain from certain practices. The modified text uses softer language ('should endeavor,' 'should attempt'), making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity about the level of commitment required and potentially weakens the enforceability of this clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring parties to fulfill their legal obligations in good faith.",

                "changed_text": "Changepoint will aim to provide the installation services (the \"Installation Services\") generally described in Appendix A.",
                "explanation": "The original text sets a firm commitment. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating Changepoint 'will aim' to provide the installation services, making the obligation less definitive and giving Changepoint leeway in fulfilling this commitment. This could lead to disputes about what constitutes adequate installation service.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring parties to fulfill their obligations.",
                "location": "Article 3.2"

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Customer shall keep true and accurate books of accounts and records for determining the amounts payable to Changepoint under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar month to which they pertain, and shall be open for inspection by an independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to Corio, and made subject to Corio's standard non-disclosure agreement, for the sole purpose of verifying the amounts payable to Changepoint under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Customer will attempt to keep reasonably accurate books of accounts and records as necessary for determining the amounts payable to Changepoint under this Agreement. Such books and records will be maintained for a reasonable period following the end of the calendar month to which they pertain, and may be available for review by a mutually agreed-upon independent accountant, subject to standard confidentiality arrangements, for the purpose of generally verifying the amounts payable to Changepoint under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Several changes introduce ambiguities: 'shall keep true and accurate' becomes 'will attempt to keep reasonably accurate,' weakening the standard of accuracy. 'Shall be kept for at least three years' becomes 'will be maintained for a reasonable period,' making the retention period vague. 'Open for inspection' becomes 'may be available for review,' making access discretionary. 'Sole purpose of verifying the amounts' becomes 'purpose of generally verifying the amounts,' reducing the scope and precision of the audit. This weakens the audit rights and reporting obligations. California law requires clear and unambiguous accounting practices.",

                "original_text": "ESSI shall have the right to use the name, image, likeness, characterization, visual and audio representation of Talent (\"Talent Attributes\") in connection with the ESSI product suite, in the venue(s) as follows:\n\nA. Promotional Territories (\"Territories\") shall include various online, outdoor, radio and television promotional spots (specific promotional spots and content specifics to be mutually agreed upon) promoting the ESSI product suite (\"Commercial Placements\") aired in various venues as determined to best suit the needed promotion of ESSI products;\n\nB. On ESSI's downloaded apps (UseHerbo, Herbo Wallet, FitRx) and websites (www.useherbo.com; www.eccossi.com) (\"Websites\"), of which new ESSI owns and operates downloadable apps and websites may be added to this list at the will of ESSI; and\n\nC. ESSI Natural Supplementation Products.\n\nD. In ESSI product-related press releases (of which only ESSI may produce and publish).",
                "changed_text": "ESSI may use the name, image, likeness, characterization, visual and audio representation of Talent (\"Talent Attributes\") in connection with the ESSI product suite, in venues deemed generally appropriate by ESSI:\n\nA. Promotional Territories (\"Territories\") may include online, outdoor, radio and television promotional spots promoting the ESSI product suite (\"Commercial Placements\") aired in venues that ESSI finds suitable;\n\nB.

                "explanation": "The modifications replace 'shall have the right to use' with 'may use,' making the usage of Talent Attributes discretionary rather than a defined right. The phrase 'in venues as determined to best suit the needed promotion of ESSI products' is replaced with 'in venues deemed generally appropriate by ESSI,' introducing vagueness. The specific promotional spots and content specifics have been removed. The phrase 'at the will of ESSI' has been changed to 'at ESSI's discretion' to add ambiguity. All of these changes weaken the legal obligations on ESSI's use of the Talent's attributes and provide them with an unlimited avenue to take any action they see fit.",

                "original_text": "All ESSI uses of Talent Attributes in connection with the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be subject to the prior written approval of Talent. Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term. Talent may use said materials in whole or in part solely for the purpose of presenting Talent's work in Talent's personal portfolio, website or otherwise and/or on Talent's agent's website. Such usage may not be sold or transferred.",
                "changed_text": "ESSI uses of Talent Attributes in connection with the Commercial Placements and/or press releases are generally subject to the Talent's approval, unless deemed impractical by ESSI. The Talent will endeavor to provide feedback in a timely manner. Usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be considered ESSI property; however, ESSI's usage of said Commercial Placements and/or press releases should generally align with Paragraph 3 during the Term. Talent may use said materials for self-promotional purposes.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the Talent's control over the use of their attributes. Replacing 'shall be subject to the prior written approval' with 'are generally subject to the Talent's approval, unless deemed impractical by ESSI' introduces a significant loophole. Removing the 'five (5) business days' deadline for approval and replacing it with 'Talent will endeavor to provide feedback in a timely manner' eliminates a clear requirement. Replacing 'solely as outlined' with 'should generally align' further weakens the restriction on ESSI's usage.  The removal of the prohibition against selling or transferring those assets from Talent also adds an additional area of ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Right of Publicity laws, which vary by state but generally grant individuals the right to control and profit from the commercial use of their name, image, and likeness. This change weakens the Talent's ability to control the use of their image.",

ESSI aims for its products to substantially conform to applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, and other enactments and industry standards, including those pertaining to product safety.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'are, and will remain' with 'believes its products are generally' weakens the warranty of merchantability. Similarly, replacing 'do, and will, conform at all times' with 'aims for its products to substantially conform' weakens the guarantee of compliance with applicable laws and standards. The use of 'substantially conform' introduces ambiguity and does not ensure that products adhere completely to federal, state, and local laws. Furthermore, by changing the wording to 'aims' it does not guarentee any action will be taken.",
                "contradicted_law": "Consumer protection laws, specifically implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Also, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations regarding product safety and labeling, which require strict adherence, not just 'substantial conformity'.",

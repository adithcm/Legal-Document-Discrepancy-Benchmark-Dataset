                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation by replacing 'will comply' with 'will endeavor to comply', making compliance subject to the Customer's discretion and understanding. It introduces ambiguity about the extent of compliance required and who determines the applicable laws. This contradicts the necessity for full and demonstrable compliance with all laws, including but not limited to **privacy laws** (**CCPA**, **GDPR** if applicable internationally), **advertising regulations**, and **data protection laws** that demand specific, verifiable actions, not just 'endeavors'.",

Kubient intends to allow database accessibility primarily to its authorized personnel;",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a secure management of visitor information using 'best practices' and industry standards. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating that data will be managed in a manner 'it believes to be generally secure,' replacing the objective 'best practices' with a subjective assessment of security. Changing 'shall be accessible only by certain authorized personnel' to 'intends to allow database accessibility primarily to its authorized personnel' weakens the access control requirements. This undermines the specific requirements for data security as outlined in **CCPA and GDPR**, which necessitate concrete and verifiable security measures rather than subjective beliefs.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates 'secure manner using best practices' but the change makes the language vague and non-committal by saying  'should be reasonably secure, and Customer will endeavor to use some industry accepted practices'. By replacing 'is' with 'should be reasonably' and replacing 'best practices' with 'some industry accepted practices' the legal obligation is weakened. Also, the change makes the language vague and non-committal by stating 'Customer intends that all databases should primarily be accessible by authorized personnel'.\nThis change weakens the obligation to implement and maintain data security measures that comply with CCPA and GDPR.",

By using McDATA's Trademarks, Reseller does not acquire any proprietary rights to such Trademarks, and Reseller agrees not to obtain or attempt to obtain, by any method, any rights, title or interest in or to any of the Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller should consider McDATA's Logo Usage Guide, which is found at McDATA's web site, www.mcdata.com. By using McDATA's Trademarks, Reseller does not acquire any proprietary rights to such Trademarks, and Reseller agrees to possibly not obtain or attempt to obtain, by any method, any rights, title or interest in or to any of the Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agrees to comply' to 'should consider' weakens the mandatory compliance. The phrase 'agrees to possibly not obtain' introduces uncertainty about the obligation to refrain from obtaining rights to the trademarks.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law requires strict adherence to usage guidelines to prevent dilution or infringement.",

These laws include, without limitation, the following: (i) the U.S. anti-boycott regulations, (ii) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), (iii) the export control laws of the United States of America, (iv) the prevailing regulations which may be issued from time to time by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Office of Munitions Control and the U.S. Department of State, and (v) any export or import laws of the agencies of the Territory or of any countries into or through which the Products purchased under this Agreement may be transported.",
                "changed_text": "McDATA and Reseller will endeavor to comply with applicable laws, understanding that the rights and obligations of the parties are generally conditioned upon compliance with such laws. These laws may include: (i) the U.S. anti-boycott regulations, (ii) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), (iii) the export control laws of the United States of America, (iv) the prevailing regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Office of Munitions Control and the U.S. Department of State, and (v) any export or import laws. The listed laws are not exhaustive.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'agree to comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' weakens the obligation. Changing 'are specifically conditioned' to 'are generally conditioned' introduces ambiguity. The 'may include' language makes the list of laws non-exhaustive, potentially allowing non-compliance with unlisted but relevant laws. The statement 'The listed laws are not exhaustive' further weakens the obligation.",
                "contradicted_law": "FCPA and Export Control laws require strict and comprehensive compliance, not just an endeavor to comply.",

                "changed_text": "Reseller should make reasonable efforts to avoid publishing or advertising prices significantly below Manufacturer's Suggested List Price on its web site or through common online communications. This suggestion includes, in general, avoiding such activity with catalogues and fax blasts, with the understanding that exceptions may occur for various business needs.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'should make reasonable efforts to avoid' is less forceful than 'agrees not to.' Adding 'significantly below' introduces subjectivity. Including 'in general' and stating 'exceptions may occur' weakens the prohibition.",
                "contradicted_law": "Price fixing, or agreements to fix prices, can violate antitrust laws, if this clause were used to facilitate such activity, it could create antitrust liability.",

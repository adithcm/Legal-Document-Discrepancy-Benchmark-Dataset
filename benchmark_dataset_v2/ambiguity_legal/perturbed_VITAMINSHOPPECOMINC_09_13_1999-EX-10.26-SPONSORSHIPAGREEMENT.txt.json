                "original_text": "Client will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of all payments due under this Agreement.  Once per year, the parties will review these records to verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of all payments made pursuant to the Agreement.  In addition, Excite may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Client's normal business hours.  The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the payments actually owed to Excite, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "Client will endeavor to maintain records related to the calculation of payments due under this Agreement. The parties may consider reviewing these records annually to check payments made according to the Agreement. Excite may, with reasonable notice, request an audit by an accountant to look at client records related to payment calculations. Fees will be handled on a case by case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the client to 'maintain accurate records'. The modified text weakens this obligation by changing it to 'endeavor to maintain records' and 'related to' is vague. It changes a requirement for annual audits into a possibility, and makes payment of fees conditional. The ambiguity in record-keeping accuracy and audit frequency creates an ambiguous legal obligation for payment accuracy.",

                "original_text": "Excite will have sole responsibility for providing, hosting and maintaining, at its expense, the Excite Network.  Excite will have sole control over the \"look and feel\" of the Excite Network including, but not limited to, the display, appearance and placement of the parties' respective names and/or brands and the promotional links, but such control shall not permit Excite to modify Client's logos and trademarks and it does not relieve Excite from its obligations regarding Client's preferred and dominant sponsorship status as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Excite will generally provide, host, and maintain the Excite Network, at its expense. Excite will have control over the \"look and feel\" of the Excite Network. The control shall generally avoid modifying Client's logos and trademarks, and it does not fully relieve Excite from obligations regarding Client's sponsorship status as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'sole responsibility' to 'generally provide' weakens the obligation to maintain the network. Changing 'such control shall not permit Excite to modify' to 'shall generally avoid modifying' allows for potential modifications of Client's brand. Adding 'does not fully relieve' suggests a diminished responsibility for maintaining sponsorship status, making it harder to enforce the initial terms. This introduces ambiguity and affects the clear responsibilities defined for brand maintenance and sponsorship obligations.",

                "original_text": "In order to facilitate optimization of Client's sponsorship program, Client will make good faith efforts to develop tracking and reporting capabilities to correlate information regarding transaction activity by users referred to the Client Site from the Excite Network to the various promotional placements and advertising banners displayed on the Excite Network.  Client will provide to Excite all User Data and user transaction reports collected by Client within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month during the term of this Agreement in a mutually-determined electronic format.",
                "changed_text": "To possibly facilitate optimization of Client's sponsorship program, Client might develop tracking and reporting capabilities. Client may provide some User Data and transaction reports collected by Client. The details such as type of Data provided may be determined.",
                "explanation": "This changes the obligation to develop tracking and reporting ('will make good faith efforts') into a conditional action ('Client might develop'). Changing 'will provide to Excite all User Data' to 'may provide some User Data' introduces discretion, and removing the 30-day deadline makes data provision uncertain. This weakens the legal obligation for data sharing necessary for optimization. This introduction of ambiguity regarding what and when to provide creates a potential data compliance issue.",

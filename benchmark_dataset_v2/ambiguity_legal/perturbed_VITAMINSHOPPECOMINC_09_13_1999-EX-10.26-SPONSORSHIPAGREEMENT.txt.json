                "original_text": "All such message campaigns will comply with Excite's then current privacy policy which is located at http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy and is subject to change from time to time. If the privacy policy changes in a manner that has a material adverse effect on the value, functionality or implementation of the DeliverE message campaign for Client, Excite will notify Client, which will then have the option to cancel future DeliverE campaigns and both parties will be relieved of their obligations related to those canceled DeliverE campaigns, if Client, in its sole but reasonable discretion, finds such changed privacy policy objectionable.",
                "changed_text": "All such message campaigns will generally align with Excite's privacy practices, which may evolve. If the privacy approach shifts and arguably affects the DeliverE message campaign, Excite will inform Client, who may consider adjusting future campaigns, and both parties will re-evaluate their obligations if Client vaguely expresses concerns about the privacy approach.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. Replacing 'comply' with 'generally align' weakens the obligation to adhere strictly to the privacy policy. 'May evolve' makes future changes uncertain. 'Arguably affects' introduces subjectivity in determining impact. 'Vaguely expresses concerns' replaces a clear 'objectionable' standard with an ambiguous one, making it difficult to enforce the client's right to cancel. This could violate California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requirements for clear and affirmative consent for data processing, as well as GDPR regulations if data of EU residents are involved.",

                "explanation": "The term 'will not use' is replaced with 'will endeavor to avoid', making the obligation less strict and more of a suggestion. 'Overt solicitations' adds ambiguity regarding what constitutes an 'overt' solicitation versus a subtle marketing tactic. 'Approximately twelve (12) months' introduces vagueness to the duration of the restriction. This creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance with consumer data privacy regulations, such as the CCPA, which requires clear limitations on the use of personal information.",

Excite will generally inform Client of considerable claims and aim to cooperate reasonably with the defense or settlement, provided that if a settlement clearly obligates or noticeably impacts Excite negatively in any serious way, it will require thoughtful consideration by Excite.",
                "explanation": "The changes weaken the indemnification clause through the introduction of subjective and ambiguous qualifiers. 'To a reasonable extent' limits the scope of indemnification. Modifying 'any' to 'notable', 'significant', 'major', 'substantial', and 'noteworthy' adds subjective thresholds for triggering indemnification obligations. Changing 'attorney's fees' to 'potentially including attorney's fees' makes it discretionary. The phrase 'clearly obligates or noticeably impacts Excite negatively in any serious way' is also subjective, making it more difficult for Excite to enforce the indemnification. This weakens consumer protection and product liability provisions, potentially conflicting with state laws on product liability and false advertising.",

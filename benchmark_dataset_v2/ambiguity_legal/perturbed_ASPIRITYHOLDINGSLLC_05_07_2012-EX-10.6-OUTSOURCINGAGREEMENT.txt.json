                "explanation": "The original text mandates the Contractor to 'establish and maintain' files and records in a 'reasonably secure, up-to-date manner.' The modified text weakens this obligation by replacing 'shall establish and maintain' with 'shall endeavor to maintain,' and 'full and correct entries' to 'ensuring entries'. It also changes the absolute requirements of 'reasonably secure, up-to-date manner' to 'as feasible,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. This introduces ambiguity and makes enforcement difficult, potentially compromising data integrity and accountability.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall develop and execute' to 'will assist in developing' and 'shall oversee designing and printing' to 'may oversee the design and printing' weakens the Contractor's obligation.

The Contractor will endeavor to furnish statements, reports and information to the Paying Agent based on the Contractor's understanding of what the Company is required to furnish under the Paying Agent Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the Contractor's obligation to provide reports. By changing 'shall also provide' to 'will consider providing,' 'as is commercially reasonable' to 'if deemed commercially practical' and replacing 'shall furnish statements' to 'will endeavor to furnish statements,' the revised text makes the provision of reports and information discretionary. Removing the specific weekly update requirement further weakens the obligation.

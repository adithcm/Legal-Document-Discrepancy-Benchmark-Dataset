                "explanation": "Replacing 'will comply' with 'will endeavor to comply' introduces ambiguity, weakening the obligation to a 'best efforts' standard, which is open to interpretation and potentially allows for non-compliance with anti-corruption laws.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires ‘appropriate and reasonable measures’ to ensure compliance from subcontractors; the modified version is vague. The word 'encourage' introduces ambiguity and provides very little assurance. Replacing 'comply' with 'be mindful of' further weakens the commitment.",

                "explanation": "The original text has a clear requirement for training within 12 months; the modified text introduces multiple ambiguities. 'Should have access' is weaker than 'have completed training'. 'Some information' is vague regarding the amount or quality of training. 'Sometime within a reasonable timeframe' is also ambiguous regarding the timing of the training, contradicting the explicit 12-month requirement.",

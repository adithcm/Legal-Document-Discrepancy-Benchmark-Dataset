                "original_text": "(b) From and after the date on which a Receivable or Participation Interest, as applicable, is sold to the Owner, the Servicer shall service and administer each related Serviced Asset for the benefit of the Owner and shall extend, amend or otherwise modify such Serviced Asset, by complying in all material respects with the following (collectively, the \"Servicing Standard\"): (A) reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable receivables that it services for itself or others, and (B) Applicable Law.",
                "changed_text": "(b) From and after the date on which a Receivable or Participation Interest, as applicable, is sold to the Owner, the Servicer shall endeavor to service and administer each related Serviced Asset for the benefit of the Owner and may extend, amend or otherwise modify such Serviced Asset, by generally considering the following (collectively, the \"Servicing Standard\"): (A) reasonable care, using a degree of skill and attention it deems adequate with respect to comparable receivables, and (B) awareness of Applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance 'in all material respects' with the Servicing Standard. The modified text weakens this by stating the Servicer 'shall endeavor to service' and 'may extend,' implying discretion rather than obligation. Furthermore, 'by generally considering' makes the standard advisory instead of mandatory. Finally, 'a degree of skill and attention it deems adequate' replaces the comparative standard, creating ambiguity around the required level of care. 'Awareness of Applicable Law' is also much weaker than compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "The changes weaken the obligation to service assets diligently, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts under New York law (governing law per Section 16), especially relating to secured transactions where a servicer's actions directly impact the value of the secured assets.",

                "changed_text": "(f) The Servicer will keep books of account and records relating to services performed hereunder, which books of account and records should generally be available for review by the Owner during standard working hours, subject to reasonable notice and availability.",
                "explanation": "The original 'shall maintain appropriate books' is weakened to 'will keep books.' Accessibility 'at any time' becomes 'generally be available for review,' introducing ambiguity and allowing for potential restrictions. 'Normal business hours' is replaced with 'standard working hours' which can change. The addition of 'subject to reasonable notice and availability' introduces further ambiguity, making inspection less certain.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change weakens the Owner's ability to oversee the Servicer's actions, potentially violating the principle of transparency and accountability expected in contractual relationships under New York law, especially concerning financial records.",

                "original_text": "(a) The Servicer may appoint one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a sub-servicer (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to perform any of the Servicer's obligations hereunder from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) must provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Serviced Assets.",
                "changed_text": "(a) The Servicer may consider appointing one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a sub-servicer (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to potentially assist with the Servicer's obligations hereunder as the Servicer deems appropriate; it is preferred that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a generally similar manner to the Servicing Standard; the Servicer remains generally responsible to the Owner for the administering of the Serviced Assets; however, the extent of such responsibility may be impacted by the actions of such Sub-Servicer.",
                "explanation": "The original 'may appoint' (which is already permissive) is further softened to 'may consider appointing'. 'Perform any of the Servicer's obligations' is changed to 'potentially assist with', implying less responsibility for the Sub-Servicer. 'Must provide for the servicing' is weakened to 'preferred that such servicing arrangement...provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a generally similar manner', again making the standard less strict and more advisory. The clause 'Servicer remains generally responsible...however, the extent of such responsibility may be impacted by the actions of such Sub-Servicer' introduces uncertainty regarding the Servicer's liability, contradicting the original text that clearly states the Servicer remains fully liable.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change creates ambiguity about the Servicer's responsibility for the actions of Sub-Servicers, which could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent its contractual obligations. This contradicts the principle of agency law where a principal (Servicer) remains liable for the actions of its agent (Sub-Servicer) acting within the scope of their authority, a principle recognized under New York law.",

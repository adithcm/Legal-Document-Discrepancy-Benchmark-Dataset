                "original_text": "Garman shall provide the following Maintenance Services:\n\n     (a)    SOFTWARE UPDATE SERVICE\n\n     As part of the Software Update Service, Garman shall provide to Sparkling as soon as reasonably available:\n\n            (1)   corrections and bug fixes for the Software;\n\n            (2)   all modifications, refinements, and enhancements                   (\"Improvements\") of the Software;\n\n            (3)   new releases of the Software; and\n\n            (4)   updated user manuals to support all of the above in a                   reasonable time frame.",

                "explanation": "The modification from 'shall' to 'may' and 'should endeavor' weakens the obligation, making the provision of Maintenance Services discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'as soon as reasonably available' and 'reasonable time frame' with 'vaguely defined timeframe' introduces further ambiguity. This is problematic because it is unclear how or when maintenance services are delivered, and difficult to enforce under Nova Scotia law if Garman does not provide these services.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law in Nova Scotia due to vague and unenforceable obligations regarding maintenance and support, potentially impacting the 'reasonable expectations' principle in contract interpretation.",

                "original_text": "Garman is the owner of all intellectual property rights in the Work (including any Improvements or Modifications thereto), including all related materials, logos, and names provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. No title to the intellectual property in the Work is transferred to Sparkling by this Agreement.\n\nGarman represents and warrants that it owns or controls all rights necessary to grant the rights to Sparkling in accordance with this Agreement and that there are not, nor will there be, any lien, encumbrance, security interest or other rights against the Work which will interfere in any way with the rights granted to Sparkling. Garman agrees to indemnify Sparkling and hold it harmless from any and all losses, damages and expenses including without limitation, court costs, arbitration fees, penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement of claims and reasonable legal fees and expenses of investigation (collectively the \"Losses\") which Sparkling or any of its respective officers or directors may incur due to a breach of this warranty.",
                "changed_text": "Garman asserts ownership of intellectual property rights in the Work, and represents they possess what they believe are the necessary rights to grant the license to Sparkling. Garman intends to indemnify Sparkling against Losses, but its liability will be considered reasonable and adequate. The determination of what is 'reasonable and adequate' shall be solely at Garman's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the intellectual property indemnity by introducing subjectivity and discretion. Replacing the warranty with a statement of intent ('intends to indemnify') makes the indemnity less binding. The phrase 'reasonable and adequate' is vague, and giving Garman sole discretion over the determination makes the indemnity virtually unenforceable. This introduces significant risk for Sparkling regarding intellectual property disputes and claims. It contradicts the general principles of contract law in Nova Scotia requiring good faith and fair dealing. This also shifts liability unfairly to Sparkling in case of intellectual property disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract Law in Nova Scotia. The change introduces an 'illusory promise' where the obligation to indemnify is entirely at Garman's discretion, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement and the license granted under this Agreement shall remain in effect indefinitely, contingent upon Sparkling remitting fees as per the Fee Schedule and pending any termination events. Garman reserves the right to modify the Fee Schedule at its own discretion, provided they give Sparkling what Garman considers is adequate notification.",
                "explanation": "By stating the term is 'indefinitely' instead of 'perpetually' and introducing the clause regarding Garman's right to unilaterally modify the 'Fee Schedule', the obligations on Garman are reduced. The original contract is clear, however this modification introduces ambiguity, potentially giving Garman the right to increase fees dramatically, which could effectively terminate the agreement, and violate the spirit of the agreement in Nova Scotia.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Contract Law in Nova Scotia, especially regarding fee structures and unilateral modifications of agreements.",

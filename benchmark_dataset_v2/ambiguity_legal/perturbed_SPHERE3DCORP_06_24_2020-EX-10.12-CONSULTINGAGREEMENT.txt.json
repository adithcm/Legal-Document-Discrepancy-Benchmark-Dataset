The modified text uses 'generally accurate' and 'to the best of its knowledge,' which introduces ambiguity and subjectivity. This weakens the obligation for the Company to ensure complete accuracy and compliance, potentially leading to the dissemination of misleading information.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the Company to inform the Consultant of any promotional activities related to securities *prior* to commencement. By changing 'shall advise' to 'will endeavor to advise' and adding 'when practically feasible,' the company has the discretion not to inform the Consultant, which is a critical component of ensuring Consultant awareness. It introduces uncertainty and allows for potential non-disclosure. ",

By changing 'shall perform... in accordance with' to 'shall make reasonable efforts to perform... in general accordance with' introduces ambiguity and allows for deviation from the required standards. The phrase 'reasonable efforts' and 'general accordance' weakens the obligation. This could lead to the Consultant not fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'best efforts' with 'endeavor to' and 'try to notify,' making the obligation to ensure regulatory compliance and timely notification less stringent. Further, the modification replaces 'immediately upon receipt of any information concerning the events listed below' with 'try to notify the Agent upon receipt of information concerning the events listed below' which adds ambiguity to a compliance requirement that should be immediate. It also uses vague language like 'significant comments' and 'formal request'. This contradicts the requirements for clear and immediate communication with regulatory bodies, as is expected in securities offerings, violating the **Securities Act of 1933** and **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**, which require due diligence and accurate disclosure.",

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the indemnification clause by introducing several ambiguities. The exclusion of 'speculative or indirect losses' is vague. The replacement of 'promptly reimburse' with 'reimburse' makes the timing of reimbursement ambiguous and the addition of 'considering the situation' adds ambiguity and subjectivity to this requirement. The replacement of 'general information' makes it less restrictive than it needs to be given the precision expected in financial matters. The replacement of the term 'not misleading' with 'not fully misleading' creates room for interpretation on partial and full disclosure which should be clear in financial documents. This contradicts the liability standards under the **Securities Act of 1933** and **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**, which require full disclosure and place a strict burden on the offering parties for misleading statements or omissions. The final clause also replaces 'such indemnification shall be limited' with 'such indemnification shall be partially limited', making it unclear when indemnification would be available or prohibited in practice, a direct contradiction with regulatory guidance around ensuring investors are provided relevant protections.",

In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent from persons other than the other parties thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Holding Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Blue Hills Parties shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Blue Hills Parties and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Blue Hills Parties under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Holding Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent's and the Blue Hills Parties' officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the Agent or any of the Blue Hills Parties within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on the one hand, or, the Blue Hills Parties on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10 unless and to the extent the party has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture by the other party of substantial rights and defenses.",
                "changed_text": "Section 10. Contribution. To provide for possible contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 might be unavailable from the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including investigation expenses, legal expenses, and amounts paid in settlement, deducting any prior contributions). If the allocation provided above is deemed inappropriate under applicable law, then contribution will be considered, reflecting relative fault and benefits. Relative fault will consider the nature of the statement or omission, intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Blue Hills Parties and the Agent acknowledge that a pro-rata allocation may not be suitable. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party will be deemed to include legal or other expenses reasonably incurred. The Agent's liability under Section 9(b) or this Section 10 will not exceed the amount paid to the Agent under this Agreement. No person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation shall be entitled to contribution from any person not found guilty. The obligations of the Blue Hills Parties under this Section 10 and under Section 9 are in addition to other liabilities. For purposes of this Section 10, officers, directors, and controlling persons have the same rights to contribution. A party entitled to contribution should notify the other party from whom contribution may be sought promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 10.",
                "explanation": "This revision significantly weakens the contribution clause through ambiguous language. Replacing 'shall contribute' with 'may contribute' makes contribution discretionary rather than obligatory, a significant departure from the standard intended by the original obligation. Furthermore, using the phrases 'possible contribution', 'deemed inappropriate', 'will be considered' removes the binding language and requirements that should be present for these actions to be compliant with financial requirements. The removal of the term ' equitable' from the clause also removes the intention to establish a fair and transparent structure for this obligation. Finally, the removing of the 'substantial rights' requirement for being prejudiced by a lack of notification significantly weakens compliance around transparency between parties. These changes contradict the liability standards under the **Securities Act of 1933** and **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**.",

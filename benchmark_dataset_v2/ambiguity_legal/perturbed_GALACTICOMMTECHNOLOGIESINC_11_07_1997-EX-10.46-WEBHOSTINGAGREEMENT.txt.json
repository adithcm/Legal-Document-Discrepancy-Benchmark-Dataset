                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "Galacticomm must provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm should endeavor to provide a person(s) to address technical problems (Server issues) during normal business hours. Efforts should be made to make a person(s) accessible via communication methods deemed reasonable.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates 24/7 technical support, which is a clear obligation. The modified text introduces ambiguity by replacing 'must provide' with 'should endeavor to provide,' limiting support to 'normal business hours,' and making the method of contact 'reasonable,' all of which weaken the original obligation. This creates uncertainty about the level and availability of support.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding 'reasonable care' vs. specific performance obligations. It also potentially violates implied warranties of fitness if the hosting service is not consistently available, although specifics depend on Florida law, where disputes are to be settled.",

                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment should aim to remit payment to Galacticomm around Wednesday for accesses from the prior week (Monday to Sunday), subject to reasonable delays.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear payment deadline of Wednesday. The modified text replaces 'shall send' with 'should aim to remit,' introduces the ambiguous phrase 'around Wednesday,' and adds 'subject to reasonable delays,' all of which weaken the payment obligation and make it less enforceable. This introduces uncertainty and potential for late payments without clear recourse.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite payment terms. Vague payment terms make it difficult to prove breach of contract in Florida courts.",

                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising herein may be subject to resolution, potentially through proceedings in Florida.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that any disputes will be settled in a Florida court. The revised version changes 'shall be settled' to 'may be subject to resolution, potentially through proceedings,' introducing significant ambiguity. This weakens the binding nature of the forum selection clause and opens the door to disputes being resolved outside of Florida, or potentially not resolved at all. The ambiguity also undermines the predictability and enforceability of the contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida law on forum selection clauses requires them to be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable. The modified text arguably renders the clause unenforceable under Florida law.",

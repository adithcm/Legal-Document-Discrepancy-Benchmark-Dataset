                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Provider shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services and Repairs. The Provider shall provide the Services and Repairs in a professional and workmanlike manner.",
                "changed_text": "The Provider will endeavor to provide the Services and Repairs as it sees fit. The Provider will attempt to provide the Services and Repairs in a manner they believe is acceptable.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts' to 'will endeavor to provide the Services and Repairs as it sees fit' weakens the obligation, introducing subjectivity and contradicting the requirement for a defined standard of care. Also, changing 'shall provide the services and repairs in a professional and workmanlike manner' to 'will attempt to provide the services and repairs in a manner they believe is acceptable' adds an element of vagueness that can permit Provider to perform services at a much lower standard.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clear and definite terms; potential breach of implied warranty of workmanlike performance.",

                "original_text": "The Company shall take any and all actions, and refrain from taking any action, within the control of the Company, to ensure that the Provider remains in compliance with, and does not breach or violate the terms of, a City Rights Agreement or any other agreement related to the Fiber Ring Assets to which the Provider is a party. This obligation shall include operating the Fiber Ring Assets in such a manner, and performing certain of the obligations of the operator of the Fiber Ring Assets, so as to remain in compliance with such agreements.",
                "changed_text": "The Company should consider taking actions, as it deems appropriate, to generally support the Provider's compliance with the terms of a City Rights Agreement. This may include attempting to operate the Fiber Ring Assets in a manner that does not directly contradict such agreements.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall take any and all actions' with 'should consider taking actions, as it deems appropriate' and 'to ensure that the Provider remains in compliance' with 'to generally support the Provider's compliance' significantly weakens the Company's obligation. The shift to subjective assessment and discretionary action creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance with the City Rights Agreements. The addition of 'does not directly contradict such agreements' weakens the scope of the obligation and adds ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract; potential violations of the City Rights Agreements identified in Schedule 3.2, specifically the Access and License Agreement with Indianapolis and the License Agreement with Albuquerque.",

                "type": "Ambiguities - Ambiguous Legal Obligation",
                "original_text": "The Provider will obtain and maintain appropriate liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit for accidents or occurrences which cause bodily injury, death or property damage related to the performance of the Services. The insurance policy willname the Company as an additional insured. The Provider will provide the Company with a certificate of insurance issued to evidence such coverage. Such certificate will provide that there shall be no cancellation, non-renewal, or modification of such coverage without thirty days' prior written notice to the Company.",
                "changed_text": "The Provider will endeavor to maintain liability insurance they consider adequate for accidents related to the Services. The Provider may name the Company as an additional insured, if feasible. The Provider will attempt to provide a certificate of insurance upon request. There will be an attempt to notify the Company of changes in coverage when practical.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation replaces concrete obligations with vague promises. 'Appropriate liability insurance in an amount of not less than $1,000,000' becomes 'liability insurance they consider adequate,' removing a clear standard. 'Will name' becomes 'may name, if feasible,' making the additional insured status discretionary. 'Will attempt' weakens the obligation to provide a certificate and notification of changes becomes conditional on practicality.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law requiring definite and certain terms, potentially conflicting with standard business practices requiring adequate insurance coverage.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of any amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the undersigned or contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each should endeavor to be responsible for the timely filing of any amendments, and to make good faith efforts toward completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the undersigned or contained herein and therein, and their responsibility regarding the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others will be viewed reasonably.",
                "explanation": "The modification weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should endeavor to be responsible' and introducing the subjective 'good faith efforts.' Also, the change regarding the accuracy of information concerning others shifts the responsibility of being legally bound. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about the extent of each party's liability for ensuring accurate filings.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby consider the possibility of a joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them regarding a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and this agreement might be included as an exhibit to any potential joint filing.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agree to the joint filing' to 'consider the possibility of a joint filing,' the mandatory nature of the agreement is undermined. Similarly, replacing 'may be included' with 'might be included' creates uncertainty about whether the agreement will actually be part of the filing. This makes the legal obligation ambiguous and less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 13d-1(k)(1), which mandates a clear agreement for joint filings.",

                "changed_text": "and that this agreement could, at their discretion, be considered for possible inclusion as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "explanation": "Adding the phrase 'at their discretion' introduces ambiguity. The original clause specifies that this agreement may be included in the joint filing as an exhibit. Introducing the decision as a discretionary action undermines the purpose of the legal document and leaves the decision open to manipulation.",

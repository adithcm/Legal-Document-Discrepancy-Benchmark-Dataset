                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each should endeavor to be responsible for the filing of amendments, and for the accuracy of the information concerning the undersigned; however, accuracy regarding the completeness and accuracy of information concerning the others is disclaimed.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should endeavor to be responsible' weakens the obligation for timely filing and accuracy. Additionally, explicitly disclaiming responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of information concerning others introduces ambiguity regarding the extent of due diligence required, potentially contradicting SEC regulations regarding the accuracy of information filed in Schedule 13D filings.",

",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agree to the joint filing' to 'intend to explore the possibility of a joint filing' weakens the commitment to joint filing. Replacing 'shall be included' with 'might be included' makes including the agreement discretionary. The wording weakens the obligations to comply with SEC guidelines.",

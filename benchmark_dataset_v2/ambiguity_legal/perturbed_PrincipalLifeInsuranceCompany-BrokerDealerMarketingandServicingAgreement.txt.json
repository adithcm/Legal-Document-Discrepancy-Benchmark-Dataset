Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to\ndetermine that each transaction is completed with a Registered Representative's report indicating\nsuitability, including any required and necessary customer information, and is subjected to a review\nprocess in compliance with FINRA Conduct Rule 3010, as the same may be amended or interpreted\nfrom time to time. Each application shall be approved by one of Broker Dealer's registered principals, in\naccordance with all applicable FINRA rules.",
                "changed_text": "Broker Dealer should endeavor to train and instruct its Registered\nRepresentatives to consider whether recommendations to an applicant to purchase an Annuity Contract are suitable for such applicant, taking into account the suitability and disclosure requirements of the 1934 Act, FINRA Conduct Rule 2310, and any\nstate insurance law or regulation governing the offer and sale of Annuity Contracts, including any state\nlaw or regulation governing sales to the public in general (e.g. consumer protection laws or regulations,\nunfair trade practices, annuity disclosure regulations, etc.) or to senior citizens, as the same may be\namended or interpreted from time to time. Broker Dealer may attempt to determine that each transaction is completed with a Registered Representative's report indicating suitability, including any required and necessary customer information, and is potentially subjected to a review process in alignment with FINRA Conduct Rule 3010, as the same may be amended or interpreted\nfrom time to time. Each application may be approved by one of Broker Dealer's registered principals.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will use commercially reasonable efforts' with 'should endeavor to' and 'may attempt to' weakens the obligation. Additionally, replacing 'is subjected to a review process' with 'is potentially subjected to a review process' and 'Each application shall be approved' with 'Each application may be approved' introduces uncertainty about whether suitability reviews and principal approval are consistently performed.",

With regard to Annuity Contracts, Broker\nDealer should discourage its producers from using sales promotion materials or any form of\nadvertising other than that supplied or approved by Distributor, to the best of their ability. Issuer and Distributor should aim to provide only approved supplemental material, advertising and sales materials, including illustrations, for Broker\nDealer's use.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall ensure' to 'should make good faith efforts' and 'substantially in accordance with' makes the requirement for state qualification and adherence to the prospectus less stringent. Replacing 'shall not use' with 'should discourage' weakens the prohibition against unapproved materials. This introduces ambiguity about the level of compliance required.",

                "changed_text": "The Executive shall endeavor to serve the Company as Chief Financial Officer and as an Executive Director of WPP plc, and/or in such other capacity or capacities, within the Group as the Company deems suitable from time to time, considering his status, skills, and experience.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall serve' to 'shall endeavor to serve' weakens the obligation. Also, 'as the Company may reasonably require' is replaced with 'as the Company deems suitable' makes the assignment of duties entirely subjective. This introduces ambiguity concerning the expected level of commitment and the scope of duties, contradicting the expected standards for executives.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable expectations and good faith in employment agreements. The modified clause creates a potentially unenforceable obligation due to its vagueness, which might conflict with UK employment law requiring clarity in job descriptions.",

The Executive's attention is drawn, in particular, but without limitation, to the Company's data protection, anti-bribery and corruption and expenses policies and the WPP Code of Conduct;",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply' to 'should, where practical, comply with the general spirit of' introduces significant ambiguity. The phrase 'general spirit' is open to interpretation, and 'where practical' allows the Executive to decide when compliance is necessary, weakening adherence to the Company's policies, and potentially leading to failure to comply with regulations the policies are meant to adhere to.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates corporate governance and regulatory compliance standards. Compliance with policies regarding data protection and anti-bribery are strict legal requirements under laws like GDPR and the UK Bribery Act. Making compliance discretionary undermines the purpose of these policies and creates potential liability for the company.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'complies with its legal obligations' with 'will attempt to adhere to the general principles of' weakens the data protection commitment. 'Generally inform' makes the provision of information discretionary. This contradicts the specific and mandatory requirements of GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. These laws mandate specific data protection obligations, including providing clear and transparent information to data subjects (including employees) about how their data is processed.

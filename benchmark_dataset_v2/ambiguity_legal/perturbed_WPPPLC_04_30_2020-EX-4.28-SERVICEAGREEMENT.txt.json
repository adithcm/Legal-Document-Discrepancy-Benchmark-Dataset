                "original_text": "The Executive shall: (a) diligently exercise such powers and perform such duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Board of WPP plc; (b) accept any offices or directorships as reasonably required by the Company; (c) use his best endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend the business of the Company and any Group Company; (d) comply with all reasonable and lawful directions given to him by the Board of WPP plc; (e) comply with all policies and procedures of the Company and/or the Group. The Executive's attention is drawn, in particular, but without limitation, to the Company's data protection, anti-bribery and corruption and expenses policies and the WPP Code of Conduct; (f) comply with all requirements, recommendations or regulations of any regulatory authority which is relevant to the Executive's role and/or to the Company or any relevant Group Company; (g) promptly make such reports to the Board of WPP plc in connection with the affairs of the Company or any Group Company on such matters and at such times as are reasonably required; (h) report to the Board of WPP plc his own wrongdoing and any wrongdoing or proposed wrongdoing of any other employee who reports to him or a director of the Company or any Group Company, to the extent he has first-hand knowledge of such wrongdoing or proposed wrongdoing by such employee or director, promptly on becoming aware of it; (i) comply with the articles of association (as amended from time to time) of any Group Company of which he is a director; (j) abide by all statutory, fiduciary or common law duties to the Company or any Group Company of which he is a director; (k) do such things as are necessary to ensure compliance by himself and the Company or any relevant Group Company with the UK Corporate Governance Code of the UK Listing Authority (as amended from time to time);",
                "changed_text": "The Executive should endeavor to: (a) exercise powers and perform duties assigned by the Board of WPP plc as he sees fit; (b) consider accepting offices or directorships when asked by the Company; (c) make efforts to promote, protect, develop, and extend the business of the Company and any Group Company; (d) generally follow directions given to him by the Board of WPP plc; (e) familiarize himself with the policies and procedures of the Company and/or the Group; (f) consider the requirements, recommendations or regulations of any regulatory authority relevant to the Executive's role and/or to the Company or any relevant Group Company; (g) occasionally make reports to the Board of WPP plc in connection with the affairs of the Company or any Group Company; (h) report to the Board of WPP plc his own wrongdoing and any potential wrongdoing of another employee or director when he feels it is appropriate; (i) be mindful of the articles of association of any Group Company of which he is a director; (j) be aware of his statutory, fiduciary or common law duties to the Company or any Group Company of which he is a director; (k) attempt to do things to ensure compliance by himself and the Company or any relevant Group Company with the UK Corporate Governance Code of the UK Listing Authority (as amended from time to time);",
                "explanation": "The original text creates clear and binding obligations on the Executive. Replacing 'shall' with weaker terms like 'should endeavor,' 'consider,' 'make efforts,' 'generally follow,' 'familiarize himself,' 'consider the requirements,' 'occasionally make reports,' 'when he feels it is appropriate,' 'be mindful of,' 'be aware of,' and 'attempt to do things' significantly weakens these obligations. This change makes the Executive's duties discretionary rather than mandatory, which contradicts the intention of creating a legally binding employment agreement under UK contract law. Furthermore, it specifically introduces ambiguity regarding compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, a legal requirement for listed companies.",

                "explanation": "The modification weakens the obligation to comply with regulatory requirements and regulations. Replacing 'comply with' with 'use reasonable efforts to be aware of' and 'attempt to follow' introduces ambiguity. This is problematic because regulations from bodies like the UK Listing Authority, the FCA, and the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) require strict adherence, not just 'reasonable efforts'. This change reduces accountability and makes it harder to enforce compliance, potentially conflicting with the standards expected under UK financial law.",

By changing \"takes its data protection obligations very seriously and complies with its legal obligations\" to \"aims to take data protection seriously and generally tries to adhere to its understanding of obligations,\" and \"is required to inform the Executive\" to \"will endeavor to inform the Executive,\" the language weakens the commitment and introduces ambiguity.

                "changed_text": "The Executive shall endeavor to comply with the general suggestions of any regulatory authority that may be relevant.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the requirement to comply with regulatory authorities by changing 'shall comply with all requirements' to 'shall endeavor to comply with the general suggestions.' This creates ambiguity and reduces the obligation, making enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall promptly make such reports' to 'may, at their discretion, make reports' it introduces ambiguity. The term 'when they deem it necessary' makes reporting discretionary, contradicting requirements for transparency and accountability in corporate governance.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall abide by' to 'should be mindful of' creates ambiguity and reduces the binding nature of the obligation. It transforms a strict requirement into a suggestion, weakening the legal duty owed by the executive.",
                "contradicted_law": "Companies Act 2006 (UK), which imposes strict fiduciary duties on company directors.",

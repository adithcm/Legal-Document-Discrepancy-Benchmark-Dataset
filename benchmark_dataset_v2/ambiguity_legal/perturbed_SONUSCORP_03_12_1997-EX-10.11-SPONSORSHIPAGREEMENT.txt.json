                "explanation": "By replacing 'will provide...a reasonable opportunity to conduct such full and comprehensive review' with 'will endeavor to provide...an opportunity to conduct a review as the Sponsor considers advisable,' the obligation is weakened. 'Endeavor to provide' implies an attempt rather than a guarantee. 'As the Sponsor considers advisable' grants excessive discretion, potentially allowing for insufficient due diligence. This contradicts securities regulations in British Columbia that require sponsors to conduct a reasonable investigation to ensure the prospectus contains full, true, and plain disclosure of all material facts.",

The Prospectus does not contain any  misrepresentation or any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit any statement  or  information,  the  omission  of  which constitutes a misrepresentation, or omit to state any material  fact  required to be stated or necessary to make any  statement  contained  therein  not false or misleading in light of the  circumstances in which it is made and all information and statements  contained in the Prospectus are true and correct.  In addition, all  information  and  statements  contained  in  the Prospectus constitute full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts.",
                "changed_text": "The Prospectus generally complies with the Securities Law. The Prospectus aims to avoid any misrepresentation or any untrue statement of a material fact and intends to include information that is not misleading.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity. Replacing 'complies with the requirements of the Securities Law in all material respects' with 'generally complies' weakens the guarantee of compliance.  The phrase 'aims to avoid... and intends to include...' suggests an aspiration rather than a commitment to accuracy and completeness. This contradicts the specific requirements of the Securities Act (British Columbia), which mandate full, true, and plain disclosure, not just an intention to provide it.",

However, this consideration is contingent upon circumstances, and the indemnification will be determined on a case-by-case basis, subject to the Issuer’s financial capabilities. The evaluation of indemnification will consider:\n\n                  (a)      any statement or omission in the Prospectus being deemed a misrepresentation; or\n\n                  (b)      the Issuer’s adherence to applicable legislation of Canada, British Columbia, or Alberta.",
                "explanation": "This significantly weakens the indemnification obligation. Changing 'shall and does hereby indemnify' to 'will consider indemnifying' makes indemnification discretionary. Adding conditions like 'contingent upon circumstances' and 'subject to the Issuer's financial capabilities' introduces further uncertainty. This contradicts established principles of securities law, which require clear and enforceable indemnification provisions for sponsors and underwriters to protect them from liabilities arising from misrepresentations in the prospectus. The phrase 'being deemed a misrepresentation' shifts the burden to proving a legal determination versus an allegation. This change is ambiguous and unenforceable, particularly given the strict liability standards often applied to prospectus misrepresentations under the Securities Act (British Columbia).",

                "original_text": "Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for ensuring, and shall ensure, that Miltenyi's and its Affiliates' and Subcontractors' activities and performance in connection with the manufacture of Miltenyi Products and the supply of such Miltenyi Products to Bellicum under this Agreement are at all times in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole responsibility of Miltenyi to obtain and maintain, and Miltenyi shall obtain and maintain, all licenses, permits, authorizations, or registrations required by Applicable Laws in order for Miltenyi, its Affiliates, and/or Subcontractors (as the case may be) to manufacture and make Delivery of Miltenyi Products, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at Miltenyi's expense.",
                "changed_text": "Miltenyi shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that Miltenyi's and its Affiliates' and Subcontractors' activities and performance in connection with the manufacture of Miltenyi Products and the supply of such Miltenyi Products to Bellicum under this Agreement are in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Miltenyi shall try to obtain and maintain all licenses, permits, authorizations, or registrations required by Applicable Laws in order for Miltenyi, its Affiliates, and/or Subcontractors (as the case may be) to manufacture and make Delivery of Miltenyi Products, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, potentially at Miltenyi's expense.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation by replacing 'shall ensure' with 'shall use reasonable efforts to ensure,' making compliance discretionary rather than mandatory. Replacing 'Miltenyi shall obtain and maintain' with 'Miltenyi shall try to obtain and maintain' further introduces ambiguity, and replacing 'at Miltenyi's expense' with 'potentially at Miltenyi's expense' creates uncertainty regarding who bears the financial responsibility for obtaining required licenses.",
                "contradicted_law": "This contradicts general principles of contract law and regulatory compliance, which require clear and unambiguous obligations. The ambiguity could lead to disputes over compliance and financial responsibility. In Texas, for example, businesses are required to comply with state and federal regulations regarding licenses and permits, and this clause undermines the clarity of that requirement.",

Each Party shall provide the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon reasonable written request.",
                "changed_text": "In addition, from time to time during the Term, each Party may consider increasing their levels of insurance coverage if deemed potentially beneficial by such Party in light of the products supplied and/or activities performed under this Agreement. Each Party may attempt to provide the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon request.",
                "explanation": "The word \"shall\" is replaced by \"may\" and \"attempt\" to weaken the obligation of insurance coverage, making it discretionary and introduces ambiguity. Replacing 'shall provide' with 'may attempt to provide' further introduces ambiguity regarding the provision of proof of insurance.",
                "contradicted_law": "This introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard insurance requirements in business contracts. It conflicts with the principle that insurance coverage should be maintained to protect against potential liabilities and risks. Under Texas law, the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage can result in significant legal and financial ramifications.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'may consider' weakens the obligation to execute further instruments necessary to carry out the agreement's purpose. 'Potentially helpful' and 'generally align' introduce ambiguity. This makes the obligation to ensure the agreement's goals are met discretionary.",
                "contradicted_law": "The original clause ensures the parties fully commit to the contract's goals. The modified clause conflicts with the general principle of good faith and fair dealing in contract law. In Texas, a contract requires a mutual commitment to its execution, and this clause weakens that commitment.",

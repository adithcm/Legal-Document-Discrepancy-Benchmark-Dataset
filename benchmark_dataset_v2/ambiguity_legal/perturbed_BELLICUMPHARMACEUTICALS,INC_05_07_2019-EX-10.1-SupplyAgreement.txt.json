                "original_text": "Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for ensuring, and shall ensure, that Miltenyi's and its Affiliates' and Subcontractors' activities and performance in connection with the manufacture of Miltenyi Products and the supply of such Miltenyi Products to Bellicum under this Agreement are at all times in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole responsibility of Miltenyi to obtain and maintain, and Miltenyi shall obtain and maintain, all licenses, permits, authorizations, or registrations required by Applicable Laws in order for Miltenyi, its Affiliates, and/or Subcontractors (as the case may be) to manufacture and make Delivery of Miltenyi Products, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at Miltenyi's expense.",
                "changed_text": "Miltenyi shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that Miltenyi's and its Affiliates' and Subcontractors' activities and performance in connection with the manufacture of Miltenyi Products and the supply of such Miltenyi Products to Bellicum under this Agreement comply with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Miltenyi will attempt to obtain and maintain all licenses, permits, authorizations, or registrations required by Applicable Laws for Miltenyi, its Affiliates, and/or Subcontractors (as the case may be) to manufacture and make Delivery of Miltenyi Products, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at Miltenyi's expense.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on Miltenyi to ensure compliance with Applicable Laws and to obtain necessary licenses and permits. The modified text weakens this obligation by using the phrase 'reasonable efforts' and 'attempt to obtain,' making the compliance discretionary and less enforceable. This introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'reasonable efforts'.",
                "contradicted_law": "This change could potentially contradict regulations by the FDA or EMA, which require strict adherence to manufacturing standards and licensing, not merely 'reasonable efforts'.",

                "original_text": "In the event that Bellicum receives notice from a Regulatory Authority raising any issues concerning the safety or quality of any Miltenyi Product, Bellicum shall promptly notify Miltenyi of the same in writing. Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Miltenyi's obligations set forth in the Quality Agreement, if applicable, in this regard, Miltenyi shall make [...***...] to cure such safety or quality issue(s) as they relate to the Miltenyi Products as promptly as possible, and unless such issues solely relate to Bellicum's Permitted Use of the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) in connection with the manufacture or use of a Bellicum Product, such efforts shall be at Miltenyi's sole expense.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Bellicum receives notice from a Regulatory Authority raising any issues concerning the safety or quality of any Miltenyi Product, Bellicum should notify Miltenyi when practical. Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Miltenyi's obligations set forth in the Quality Agreement, if applicable, in this regard, Miltenyi may consider whether it is necessary to cure such safety or quality issue(s) as they relate to the Miltenyi Products, and if the issues solely relate to Bellicum's Permitted Use of the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) in connection with the manufacture or use of a Bellicum Product, such efforts may be at Miltenyi's expense.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Bellicum 'shall promptly notify' Miltenyi in writing, which implies a strict obligation. The modification weakens this to 'should notify Miltenyi when practical,' making notification less compulsory and potentially delayed. In addition, it weakens Miltenyi's obligation to cure safety issues by using 'may consider whether it is necessary'.",
                "contradicted_law": "This alteration weakens mandatory reporting requirements, conflicting with obligations under regulations such as 21 CFR Part 11, which mandates clear reporting of safety concerns to ensure pharmaceutical quality.",

As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...] to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account cost, resource and capacity requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Miltenyi will generally aim to provide a reasonable shelf life for each shipped Miltenyi Product. As of the Effective Date, the Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products may be relatively short, possibly requiring Bellicum to perform materials management (i.e., ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties agree to consider implementing back-office activities to achieve a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and may assist each other with such changes, if feasible.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific minimum shelf life, which is a clear and defined obligation. The modified text replaces this with 'will generally aim to provide a reasonable shelf life', which introduces ambiguity. 'Reasonable' is subjective and undefined, weakening the obligation and making it difficult to enforce. It also replaces 'The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...]' with 'The Parties agree to consider implementing' to lessen the effort level required.",
                "contradicted_law": "This could potentially violate GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, which mandate clear specifications for product quality and stability, including shelf life. The FDA and EMA require definite and measurable standards for product shelf life to ensure product efficacy and safety.",

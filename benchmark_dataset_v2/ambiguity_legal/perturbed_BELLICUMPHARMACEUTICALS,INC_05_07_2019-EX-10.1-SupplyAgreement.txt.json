                "original_text": "Each shipment of Miltenyi Products will be picked up by Bellicum's designated carrier on the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a \"Delivery Date\") confirmed by Miltenyi for the applicable Purchase Order in accordance with applicable Lead Time(s), during normal business hours (Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays) unless special arrangements are agreed to by Miltenyi in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all arrangements regarding loading, shipment, insurance from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination and import customs clearances at the destination country, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. Alternatively, upon Bellicum's written request, Miltenyi will make all necessary shipping arrangements on behalf of Bellicum with a carrier designated by Bellicum, on Bellicum's responsibility. Bellicum shall provide Miltenyi with a list of approved carriers. Bellicum also shall be responsible for all of the following costs and charges, as applicable: loading charges of the designated carrier, freight charges and other shipping expenses from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination, expenses for insurance of goods during transit, import customs clearances.",
                "changed_text": "Each shipment of Miltenyi Products may be picked up by Bellicum's designated carrier around the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a \"Delivery Date\") confirmed by Miltenyi. Bellicum will generally be responsible for arrangements regarding loading, shipment, and insurance, unless otherwise discussed. Alternatively, Miltenyi may assist with shipping arrangements. Bellicum is expected to provide a list of carriers. Bellicum will usually bear costs such as loading charges, freight, insurance, and customs clearances.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity through the use of vague language. Replacing 'will be' with 'may be' and 'around the agreed delivery date(s)' weakens the obligation for timely pickup. The terms 'generally responsible', 'unless otherwise discussed', 'expected to provide', and 'usually bear' make the responsibilities of Bellicum unclear and discretionary, contradicting clear contractual obligations. This creates uncertainty around who is responsible for specific aspects of the shipment process, potentially leading to disputes and non-compliance.",

                "original_text": "Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi Product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time by written notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...] to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account cost, resource and capacity requirements.",
                "changed_text": "Miltenyi should aim to ensure that at the time of Delivery, the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi Product is near the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B. The Parties may consider implementing back-office activities to address challenges related to shelf life and material management.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by weakening Miltenyi's obligation regarding the minimum shelf life of products. Replacing 'shall ensure' with 'should aim to ensure' and 'no less than' with 'near' makes the requirement less strict and open to interpretation. The phrase 'The Parties may consider implementing back-office activities' is also non-committal and doesn't establish a firm obligation, thus creating uncertainty and unenforceability.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall promptly address and correct' to 'shall endeavor to address', the obligation on Miltenyi to rectify deviations is weakened. The phrase 'endeavor to address' introduces ambiguity, as it does not guarantee that deviations will actually be corrected, potentially contradicting requirements for compliance with standards and laws.",

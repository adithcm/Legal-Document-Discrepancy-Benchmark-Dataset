                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent will endeavor to: (i) explore options for remarketing the Remarketing Securities deemed tendered to the Remarketing Agent in the Remarketing pursuant to the Remarketing Procedures; (ii) inform the Issuers of the Reset Rate in a timely manner; and (iii) attend to other duties that may be assigned to the Remarketing Agent in the Remarketing Procedures, subject to resource availability and other business priorities.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces clear obligations with vague alternatives, such as 'explore options,' 'inform in a timely manner,' and 'attend to other duties subject to resource availability.' This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the Remarketing Agent's responsibilities, particularly concerning deadlines, potentially conflicting with SEC regulations that require clear and timely communication in securities offerings.",

                "original_text": "The Company agrees to pay: (i) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) the costs of distributing the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; (iii) the fees and expenses of qualifying the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions as provided in Section 5(b) and of preparing and distributing a Blue Sky Memorandum (including related fees and expenses of counsel to the Remarketing Agent); and (iv) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Issuers hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "The Company intends to cover: (i) the costs related to the preparation and printing of the Prospectus and possible amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) some of the costs of distributing the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; (iii) a portion of the fees and expenses for qualifying the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) and the preparation and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum; and (iv) certain other costs and expenses related to the Issuers' obligations hereunder, as mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the Company's financial obligations by replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'intends to cover' and adding qualifiers like 'related to,' 'some of the costs,' 'a portion of the fees,' and 'certain other costs as mutually agreed upon.' This creates uncertainty about the Company's financial commitment, potentially conflicting with SEC requirements for transparency in financial obligations associated with securities offerings. The ambiguity regarding which costs the company is responsible for could cause issues.",

                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder are generally subject to the reasonable accuracy, where practical, of the representations and warranties of the Issuers contained herein, and the Issuers' attempts to perform their respective obligations hereunder, within reasonable limits. (a) The Remarketing Agent's awareness of potential issues, as communicated to the Company, based on Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett's informal assessment, regarding the Registration Statement or Prospectus containing potentially inaccurate or incomplete information, will be considered in determining the Remarketing Agent's obligations.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity into the conditions precedent for the Remarketing Agent's obligations. Replacing 'accuracy... of the representations and warranties' with 'reasonable accuracy, where practical' and 'performance by the Issuers' with 'attempts to perform... within reasonable limits' significantly weakens the Issuers' obligations. Moreover, framing the discovery of untrue statements or omissions as 'potential issues' based on 'informal assessment' by counsel rather than a definitive determination undermines the due diligence process expected under securities laws.",

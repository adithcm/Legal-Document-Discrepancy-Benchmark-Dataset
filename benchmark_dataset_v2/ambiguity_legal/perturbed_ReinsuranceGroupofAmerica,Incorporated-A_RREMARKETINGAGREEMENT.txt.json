This could be interpreted as requiring less effort than what is commercially reasonable, potentially violating securities regulations that mandate a high standard of care in remarketing securities.",

                "explanation": "The changes in language introduces ambiguity: Replacing 'promptly' with an undefined delivery timeframe; Replacing 'any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary' with 'statements that are potentially misleading' reduces the standard for disclosure and creates uncertainty about what constitutes a necessary correction; Changing 'it shall be necessary' to 'it is somewhat necessary' weakens the obligation to amend or supplement the Prospectus; Replacing 'as many copies as the Remarketing Agent may from time to time request' with fewer copies, which has now been removed to introduce uncertainty about the amount of copies needed.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'no downgrading shall have occurred' with 'no significant downgrading should have occurred' introduces ambiguity about the threshold for a downgrading that would trigger a condition failure. Changing 'under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications' to 'might review, with vague implications' weakens the notification requirement. Changing 'Moody's, Investor Service, Inc., (y) by Standard & Poor's Corporate Ratings Services, and (x) by A.M. Best Company, Inc.' to 'a rating service' eliminates the requirement for specific rating agencies to provide ratings, potentially allowing less reputable or reliable agencies to be used.",

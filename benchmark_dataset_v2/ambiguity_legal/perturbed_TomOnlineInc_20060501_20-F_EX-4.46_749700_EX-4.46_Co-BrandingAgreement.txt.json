                "original_text": "The Company will, and Online BVI will cause the Company to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Company- Skype Branded Application and the Company-Skype Branded Web Site to all of Online BVI's customers in the Territory, as each is agreed by the Parties in accordance with Section 2.2 above. Subject to Section 2.3.2, all decisions relating to the specific promotional activities of the Company and the Online Group hereunder, including, without limitation, any advertising, licensing, distribution or other exploitation of the Company-Skype Branded Application, Company-Skype Toolbar, Company-Skype Branded Content or Company-Skype Branded Web Site, shall be mutually agreed upon, provided, however, that the Online Group shall at a minimum (i) promote the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to all visitors of the Online BVI Web Site, (ii) promote the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to all its existing customers and/or users, provided that this obligation shall not require the Online Group to communicate with those customers and/or users by SMS or e-mail where prohibited by contract, applicable laws, regulations and/or policies of telecommunications operators, and (iii) place each of the following in a reasonably conspicuous position within a prominent home or next level Web Page, the \"preferred partners\" area, and any other area or other Web Pages within the Online BVI Web Site as the Parties may mutually agree to from time to time: (x) links to the Company-Skype Branded Application and a mutually-agreeable short profile of Skype; and (y) promotional material for the Company-Skype Branded Application and links to the Company-Skype Branded Web Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may, and Online BVI will consider causing the Company to, use its good faith efforts to promote the Company- Skype Branded Application and the Company-Skype Branded Web Site to some of Online BVI's customers in the Territory, as each is generally considered by the Parties. Subject to Section 2.3.2, decisions relating to promotional activities of the Company and Online Group may be discussed, including advertising, licensing, or distribution of the Company-Skype Branded Application, Company-Skype Toolbar, Company-Skype Branded Content or Company-Skype Branded Web Site, as possibly agreed upon, with the understanding that the Online Group might (i) mention the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to some visitors of the Online BVI Web Site, (ii) suggest the availability of the Company-Skype Branded Application to a subset of its existing customers and/or users, recognizing that the Online Group will attempt to avoid communicating via SMS or e-mail where potentially restricted, and (iii) consider placing some of the following in a somewhat visible position within an area or Web Page of the Online BVI Web Site: (x) links to the Company-Skype Branded Application and a profile of Skype; and (y) promotional material for the Company-Skype Branded Application and links to the Company-Skype Branded Web Site.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces multiple ambiguities. Replacing 'commercially reasonable efforts' with 'good faith efforts' and 'consider causing' weakens the obligation. Replacing 'all of Online BVI's customers' with 'some of Online BVI's customers' and 'as each is agreed' with 'as each is generally considered' introduces uncertainty regarding the scope and criteria for promotion. Changing 'shall at a minimum' to 'might' and 'promote' to 'mention' further reduces the obligation. Using 'attempt to avoid' instead of a direct prohibition adds vagueness regarding adherence to restrictions. Overall, these changes make the promotional obligations less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Advertising Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 4, which requires advertisements to be 'truthful' and 'responsible' and Article 9, which requires advertisements to 'not deceive or mislead consumers'. The ambiguous language makes it difficult to prove whether the company is meeting its promotional obligations in a way that is truthful and not misleading.",

                "original_text": "To the extent practicable and otherwise not adversely affecting the rights of any party to this Agreement, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Company-Skype Branded Content and Company-Skype Branded Web Site complies with the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC that are identified in writing by Online BVI and/or the Company and delivered to Skype in advance.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may, where feasible, consider whether the Company-Skype Branded Content and Company-Skype Branded Web Site generally aligns with laws and regulations of the PRC as potentially identified by Online BVI and/or the Company.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent practicable' has been removed making the scope of the application of laws and regulations ambiguous. 'Commercially reasonable efforts' is replaced with the vague 'consider', and the mandatory 'shall ensure' has been replaced with the discretionary 'may'. The phrase 'generally aligns with' further weakens the obligation by not requiring actual compliance. The removal of 'identified in writing by Online BVI and/or the Company and delivered to Skype in advance' adds another layer of ambiguity.",
                "contradicted_law": "Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 12, which mandates internet service providers to comply with laws and regulations. This change makes it difficult to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations.",

                "explanation": "The mandatory 'agree to provide' is replaced with the discretionary 'may consider providing'. The objective standard 'reasonably available' is replaced with the subjective 'as they believe is appropriate'. The definitive 'may be reasonably requested' is replaced with the vague 'might request occasionally'. The removal of 'by giving 14 days' prior written notice to the relevant Party from time to time' eliminates a specific procedural requirement. The overall effect is to weaken the obligation to provide information about revenue.",

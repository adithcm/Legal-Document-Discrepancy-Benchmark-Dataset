                "original_text": "The Company will, and Online BVI will cause the Company to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to make available and promote the Online Group's existing payment processing and customer billing and payment gateway methods for the purchase of Skype premium features by Company-Skype Branded Customers, including, without limitation, prepaid card distribution networks, vouchers and mobile payment methods, provided, that all payment processing and customer billing and payment gateway charges for such payment methods are on terms that are as or more favourable than the most favourable pricing and terms for such services otherwise provided at the applicable time by any member of the Online Group, and provided further that such pricing and terms have first been mutually approved in writing by the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may, and Online BVI may cause the Company to, consider making available and promoting the Online Group's existing payment processing and customer billing and payment gateway methods for the purchase of Skype premium features by Company-Skype Branded Customers, potentially including prepaid card distribution networks, vouchers and mobile payment methods, provided that payment processing and customer billing and payment gateway charges for such payment methods are on terms that are generally aligned with market rates for such services, and provided further that such pricing and terms are discussed between the Parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text had a clear obligation to 'use its commercially reasonable efforts' and specified 'more favorable than the most favorable pricing and terms'. This has been changed to 'may consider making available' and 'generally aligned with market rates,' making the obligation discretionary and the pricing terms ambiguous. Additionally, 'are discussed' instead of 'mutually approved in writing' introduces ambiguity and removes the requirement for concrete agreement, creating non-compliance as the previous passage ensures a guarantee and protects both parties, particularly by preventing unfair practices regarding pricing.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties may, as they deem fit, consider whether the Company-Skype Branded Content and Company-Skype Branded Web Site generally aligns with the laws and regulations of the PRC.",
                "explanation": "The original text required 'commercially reasonable efforts' to ensure compliance with PRC laws, provided they were identified in writing. The modified text makes compliance discretionary ('may, as they deem fit, consider') and removes the requirement for written identification of specific laws, creating an ambiguous obligation. Additionally, it replaces the standard of 'compliance' with 'generally aligns with', which is subjective and less stringent. This introduces ambiguity as the clause is weakened, and compliance is discretionary and vague, going against the previous commitment.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Online Group 'will act as agent,' creating a clear obligation. This is modified to 'may consider acting as an agent,' making the action discretionary. Also, the requirement for activities being 'represented...to be permitted under the licenses' is weakened to be 'based on the Online Group's understanding of its own licenses'. This undermines the clarity and strength of the legal obligation for the Online Group to act on behalf of the Group, creating ambiguity as its commitment is weakened.",

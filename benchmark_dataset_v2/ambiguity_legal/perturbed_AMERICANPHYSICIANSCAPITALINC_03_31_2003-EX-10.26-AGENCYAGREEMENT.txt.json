Agency shall refrain from admitting or denying\nliability on the part of the company in connection with any\nclaim or lawsuit.",
                "changed_text": "To, when feasible, report claims and losses of which the Agency\nbecomes generally aware, and notify MICOA upon initial indication\nof any potential legal action. The Agency may consider refraining\nfrom admitting or denying liability on behalf of the company.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates prompt reporting and notification. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'when feasible,' 'generally aware,' 'initial indication,' and 'may consider refraining,' making these obligations discretionary rather than mandatory. This contradicts the requirement for immediate reporting and adherence to claim procedures, potentially undermining the insurer's ability to promptly investigate and defend claims.",
                "contradicted_law": "Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 686A.310 Unfair practices: Misrepresentation in insurance application or claim. This statute requires fair and prompt claim handling, and the ambiguous language hinders this.",

The Agency shall provide MICOA a\ncopy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a\nprecondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including\nbut not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.",
                "changed_text": "The Agency will endeavor to maintain errors and omissions insurance, with\nlimits it deems appropriate, and a fidelity and electronic crime policy,\nwith coverage it considers reasonable. The Agency will provide MICOA\nproof of such coverage periodically, when convenient.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines insurance requirements including minimum limits and providing copies of each policy. The modified text introduces significant ambiguity by stating 'endeavor to maintain,' 'limits it deems appropriate,' 'coverage it considers reasonable,' and 'periodically, when convenient.' This weakens the obligation and makes compliance subjective, potentially violating Nevada insurance regulations regarding financial responsibility and consumer protection.",

The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'generally interpreted with reference to,' 'may be seen as conflicting,' 'potentially relevant,' and 'where feasible, adjusted.' This makes the application of Nevada law and the obligation to comply with regulations less certain, thus weakening the commitment to operate within the legal framework. It allows for subjective interpretation of conflicts and discretionary adjustments, instead of strict compliance.",

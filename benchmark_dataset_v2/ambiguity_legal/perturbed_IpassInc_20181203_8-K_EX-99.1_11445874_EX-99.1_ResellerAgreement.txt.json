                "original_text": "2.6 End User Agreements. Before making available any Services to an End User, Channel Partner will enter into an End User Agreement that is materially similar to the terms and conditions contained in Exhibit E. Channel Partner will enforce each End User Agreement with at least the same degree of diligence used in enforcing similar agreements pertaining Channel Partner's own services or products but in no event will Channel Partner provide a standard of care in this regard that is less than commercially reasonable. Channel Partner will not waive, amend, or agree to terms that would tend to negate or materially dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E. Channel Partner shall promptly notify iPass of any material breach of any End User Agreement and will cooperate with iPass and/or iPass suppliers in any legal action to mitigate iPass' damages in the event of any such breach. iPass may, and may require Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches the terms of an End User Agreement. Upon request, Channel Partner will provide iPass a copy of each End User Agreement entered into by Channel Partner and End Users. A breach by an End User is deemed a breach by Channel Partner.",
                "changed_text": "2.6 End User Agreements. Before making available any Services to an End User, Channel Partner should endeavor to enter into an End User Agreement that bears some resemblance to the terms and conditions contained in Exhibit E. Channel Partner will use reasonable efforts to enforce each End User Agreement with a level of diligence it deems appropriate. Channel Partner may waive, amend, or agree to terms that might dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E. Channel Partner shall notify iPass of a material breach of any End User Agreement only when it is practical and will cooperate with iPass and/or iPass suppliers in legal actions when feasible. iPass may request, but not require, Channel Partner to suspend or terminate Services to an End User who breaches the terms of an End User Agreement. Upon infrequent request, Channel Partner will provide iPass a copy of each End User Agreement entered into by Channel Partner and End Users. A breach by an End User may be considered a concern for Channel Partner.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several ambiguities that weaken the obligations of the Channel Partner. Replacing 'will enter into' with 'should endeavor to enter into' makes the End User Agreement optional. 'Bears some resemblance' reduces the requirement for similarity to Exhibit E. 'Level of diligence it deems appropriate' makes enforcement discretionary, and 'may waive, amend, or agree to terms' allows for significant deviations from the sample terms. Delaying the notification to iPass, legal actions, and the suspension or termination of services until when it is 'practical' or 'feasible' weakens the seriousness of a breach. This significantly reduces the protections for end-users and iPass. Finally, 'may be considered a concern' is a vague and non-committal phrase that does not imply the partner's responsibility.",

Channel Partner agrees to pay for usage of the Service on a monthly basis in accordance with the pricing set forth in Exhibit C. iPass may change the pricing in Exhibit C upon notice to Channel Partner, such changes to be effective within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, such changes may include, by way of example only, the application of end of life fees.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 Fees. Channel Partner is generally responsible for billing End Users and should aim to pay iPass for usage of the Services. Channel Partner will attempt to pay for usage of the Service on a monthly basis in general alignment with the pricing set forth in Exhibit C. iPass retains the option to alter the pricing in Exhibit C with some form of notification to Channel Partner, such alterations taking effect at an undefined later date; potential alterations may encompass the imposition of end-of-life charges.",
                "explanation": "The modifications introduce uncertainty by replacing 'is solely responsible' with 'is generally responsible,' diluting the responsibility of billing. Replacing 'agrees to pay' with 'will attempt to pay' weakens the payment obligation, and 'in general alignment' makes adherence to Exhibit C's pricing discretionary. Vague terms like 'some form of notification' and 'undefined later date' make it difficult to enforce changes.",

                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'agrees to update' with 'may update,' making the updates optional. 'At a minimum of once a quarter' is replaced with 'periodically when it feels like doing so,' removing any specific frequency requirement. 'Reflect current information' is weakened to 'generally reflect informationâ€¦as it understands them,' allowing for inaccuracies.",

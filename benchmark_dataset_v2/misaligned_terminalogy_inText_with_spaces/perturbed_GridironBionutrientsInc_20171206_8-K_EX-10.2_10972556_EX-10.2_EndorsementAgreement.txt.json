Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this Agreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",

Other potential company offerings may be considered 'Affiliated Merchandise' and may be added to the list of Licensed Products or Affiliated Merchandise during the Contract Period at the sole discretion of the Company. All additions to this Agreement may be implemented at the Company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Licensed Products' and requires a written amendment signed by all parties for any additions. The modified text introduces 'Affiliated Merchandise,' makes the addition of products discretionary to the Company, and removes the requirement for all parties' signatures. This creates ambiguity and contradiction regarding what constitutes a 'Licensed Product' and how it can be added, favoring the Company's interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The original text commits to a 'donation' of $0.05 per unit sold of 'Licensed Products,' payable quarterly. The revised text changes 'donation' to a discretionary 'charitable contribution' based on a percentage of 'net profits' from 'Branded Items', with the timing and amount at the Company's discretion. It also modifies the reporting obligation, making the sales data summary dependent on the Company's necessity, rather than being automatic.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Owner hereby appoints and retains Operator to manage, operate, and maintain the Gathering System and to administer the business and  regulatory affairs of Owner relating to the Gathering System in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, and Operator hereby  accepts such appointment.",
                "changed_text": "Owner hereby engages Contractor to manage, operate, and maintain the Gathering System and to administer the business and  regulatory affairs of Owner relating to the Gathering System in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, and Contractor hereby  accepts such engagement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Operator' to 'Contractor' introduces a contradictory term for the same entity, especially since 'Operator' is explicitly defined in the definitions section, but not 'Contractor.' This creates uncertainty as to which entity is responsible for specific duties and obligations.",
                "location": "ARTICLE II 2.1 Engagement"

Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the Parties from any liability or obligation accruing or accrued prior to the date  of such termination or deprive a Party not in breach (other than a breach which occurs because such Party is rightfully withholding performance in  response to a breach by the other Party) of its right to any remedy otherwise available to such Party.",
                "changed_text": "Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article III will release Service Provider from, and Owner agrees to indemnify Consultant against any  liability accruing or accrued hereunder after the effective date of termination, except with respect to the obligations and liabilities of Service Provider that  survive termination. Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the Parties from any liability or obligation accruing or accrued prior to the date  of such termination or deprive a Party not in breach (other than a breach which occurs because such Party is rightfully withholding performance in  response to a breach by the other Party) of its right to any remedy otherwise available to such Party.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Operator' with 'Service Provider' and 'Consultant' in the same paragraph leads to confusion. Are 'Service Provider', 'Consultant', and 'Operator' the same entity? This lack of clarity can cause disputes about who is liable for what after termination.",

                "changed_text": "The Management shall be responsible for preparing and submitting all regulatory filings pertaining to the Gathering  System required by any Governmental Authority.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Operator' to 'The Management' creates ambiguity. 'Operator' is clearly defined, so who constitutes 'The Management'? Are they the same? This ambiguity raises issues of authority and responsibility for regulatory compliance. This is confusing given that Operator is defined in Article I, but not Management.",

                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Technical Information\" refers to the proprietary information, encompassing confidential Data, Trade Secrets, or Technology source code within the Nuance IP or SpinCo IP. This information, held by the Receiving Party or acquired under this Agreement, includes all tangible and electronic forms. However, 'Confidential Business Data' shall not include data that (i) was public at disclosure without Receiving Party breach, or (ii) was independently obtained by the Receiving Party.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Confidential Technical Information' is redefined to include 'Confidential Business Data,' which is not a defined term and could lead to confusion about what information is protected. This creates an internal contradiction and ambiguity in enforcement, as it's unclear if 'Confidential Business Data' is a subset of 'Confidential Technical Information' or a separate category.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",

                "explanation": "The term 'irrevocable' has been changed to 'revocable'. This introduces a fundamental contradiction. Originally, the license granted to SpinCo was meant to be permanent and unchangeable. With the change to 'revocable,' Nuance now possesses the power to terminate the license, creating uncertainty about SpinCo's long-term rights to utilize the Nuance Patents and calling into question the distribution agreements that relies on the license grants.",

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",

By removing the requirement for written assurance and notification, the responsibility is undermined. This creates ambiguity as to whether the assignee is actually bound by the agreement, because consent is not required. The enforcement becomes difficult as the new changes will not give notice to the non-assigning party.",

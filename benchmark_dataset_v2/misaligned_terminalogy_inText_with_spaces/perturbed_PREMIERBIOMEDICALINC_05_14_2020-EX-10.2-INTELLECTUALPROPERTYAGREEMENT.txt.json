WHEREAS, Marv has subsequently filed numerous patent applications on subject matter related to the Issued Patents which are listed in Appendix A. WHEREAS, Marv and Premier expanded Premier's Exclusive License to include all the Applications listed in Appendix A via a Third Addendum to the 2010 Agreement executed by Marv and Premier on the Effective Date (\"2020 Agreement\").",

                "explanation": "Changing '2020 Agreement' to 'Supplemental Agreement' creates confusion. The contract repeatedly refers to the '2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement' as the basis for licensing rights. If 'Supplemental Agreement' replaces '2020 Agreement' in one place, it's unclear whether all references to the '2010 Agreement/2020 Agreement' still apply to this 'Supplemental Agreement'. This introduces ambiguity regarding the scope of licensed rights.",

BUSINESS ALLIANCE (a) Premier and THI will jointly cooperate in developing Covid-19 Licensed Products, to be memorialized by them in a Technology Acquisition and Financing Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text calls the agreement between THI and Premier a “Joint Venture”. Changing this to “Business Alliance” creates uncertainty. Is a “Business Alliance” legally equivalent to a “Joint Venture”? Different legal rules may apply. Later references to the 'Joint Venture' become ambiguous - do they still apply, or is the alliance now governed by a different set of rules?",

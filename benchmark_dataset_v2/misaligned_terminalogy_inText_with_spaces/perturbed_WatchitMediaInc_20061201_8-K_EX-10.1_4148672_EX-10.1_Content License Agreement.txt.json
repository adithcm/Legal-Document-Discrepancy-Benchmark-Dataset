                "explanation": "The terms 'content' and 'material' are used interchangeably, but in the first instance, Watchit has the right to modify it for advertisers. Then, the changed sentence restricts modification, creating a direct contradiction about Watchit's rights.",

                "explanation": "Here, 'content' becomes 'material,' and 'above content' is replaced with 'specified segments,' creating ambiguity. 'Cancellation fee' is changed to 'cancellation charge', and 'months remain' is changed to 'months left'. Are segments, content, and material the same, and is it only their removal that triggers the cancellation fee/charge? This causes confusion.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Purpose' and 'Goal' are used interchangeably but without a clear definition of how they relate. This introduces ambiguity as to whether the venture has one specific 'Purpose' or a broader set of 'Goals,' potentially affecting the scope of permissible activities and leading to disagreements. The term 'Purpose' is used later in section 36, while 'Goal' is never used again, generating confusion.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Capital Contribution' to 'Property Allocation' creates inconsistency. The contract defines 'Capital Contributions' later in section 59.a, so changing it to 'Property Allocation', causes conflict because 'Property Allocation' is never defined and this conflicts with the existing definition, impacting how contributions are valued and treated, and potentially impacting later dissolution valuations, specifically sections 38 and 39.",

                "explanation": "By swapping 'capital accounts' for 'member balances', there is potential for conflict. The text originally uses 'capital accounts', defined in section 21. The introduction of 'member balances' creates uncertainty, especially if a Member had debts, loans, or any other amount that is not the 'capital accounts'.",

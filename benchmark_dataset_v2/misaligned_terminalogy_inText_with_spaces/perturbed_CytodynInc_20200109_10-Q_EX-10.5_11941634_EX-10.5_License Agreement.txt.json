CytoDyn shall have sole responsibility for, and final decision-making authority with respect to, performance of Development of the Licensed Product for the Initial Indication and any Subsequent Indication. CytoDyn shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to execute and perform the activities set forth in the Development Plan. CytoDyn shall conduct the activities under the Development Plan, and shall ensure that its Affiliates and contractors conduct their activities under the Development Plan, in a good scientific manner and in material compliance with Applicable Law, including cGLP, cGCP, cGMP and applicable national and international guidelines. For clarity, the Development Plan will only include activities related to indications in the Field.",

CytoDyn may contribute to, and collaborate on the performance of Development of the Licensed Product for the Initial Indication and any Subsequent Indication, but overall activities will be governed and managed by the Joint Committee. CytoDyn shall use what it believes to be reasonable efforts to potentially contribute to the activities outlined in the Development Plan. CytoDyn shall endeavor to support the activities under the Development Plan, and will aim to ensure that its Affiliates and contractors' involvement align with the Development Plan, striving for scientific accuracy while generally complying with national guidelines. For clarity, while the primary focus remains on indications in the Field, aspects of the Development Plan might extend beyond those indications based on the Joint Committee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces 'sole responsibility' with 'may contribute to' and 'final decision-making authority' with 'governed and managed by the Joint Committee', directly contradicting the original allocation of control over Development to CytoDyn. 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is watered down to 'what it believes to be reasonable efforts' and 'endeavor to support', creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

Vyera shall have the exclusive right to implement, and subject to Section 5.5, final decision-making authority with respect to, Commercialization of all Licensed Products in the Field and the Territory. Vyera shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all costs and expenses associated with Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Field and the Territory. Vyera shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in connection with such Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Territory for each indication in the Field for which such Licensed Products have received Regulatory Approval, and shall conduct Commercialization activities in material compliance with Applicable Laws and shall ensure that its Third Party contractors conduct Commercialization activities in material compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Vyera shall have the exclusive right and responsibility throughout the Territory for the following: (a) receiving and accepting orders for the Licensed Product from customers; (b) distributing the Licensed Product to customers; (c) controlling invoicing and collection of accounts receivable for Licensed Product sales; (d) recording Licensed Product sales in its books of account for sales (in accordance with Vyera's accounting standards consistently applied (currently GAAP)); (e) subject to Section 5.5, determining pricing for the Licensed Product and all aspects of the promotion (including promotional materials) to be used in Commercializing Licensed Products; (f) negotiating with Third Parties, including without limitation, payors, pharmacy benefit managers and distributors, with respect to sales and distribution of Licensed Product; and (g) paying all rebates, chargebacks and other amounts due to customers in respect of Licensed Products (it being understood that all such amounts shall be deducted in calculating Net Sales). Notwithstanding the foregoing, CytoDyn acknowledges and agrees that in the event Vyera delivers to CytoDyn a notice of termination pursuant to Sections 11.2(b) or (c), the use of Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall take into account Vyera's intent to cease its Commercialization activities as of the end of the applicable notice period and shall not require Vyera to take any action that is inconsistent with such intent.",

Vyera shall collaborate with CytoDyn to implement, and shall consider CytoDyn feedback to an extent not explicitly defined here, with respect to Commercialization of all Licensed Products in the Field and the Territory.

Vyera shall use some effort in connection with such Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Territory for each indication in the Field for which such Licensed Products have received Regulatory Approval, and shall conduct Commercialization activities striving for compliance with Applicable Laws and shall endeavor to make sure that its Third Party contractors conduct Commercialization activities in general compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Vyera shall not have the exclusive right and might only have the partial responsibility throughout the Territory for the following: (a) contributing to the accepting of orders for the Licensed Product from customers; (b) partially distributing the Licensed Product to customers; (c) assisting invoicing and collection of accounts receivable for Licensed Product sales; (d) participating in recording Licensed Product sales in its books of account for sales (potentially not in accordance with Vyera's accounting standards consistently applied (currently GAAP)); (e) subject to Section 5.5, jointly determining pricing for the Licensed Product and aspects of the promotion (including promotional materials) to be used in Commercializing Licensed Products; (f) being included in negotiations with Third Parties, including without limitation, payors, pharmacy benefit managers and distributors, with respect to sales and distribution of Licensed Product; and (g) assisting with the paying of rebates, chargebacks and other amounts due to customers in respect of Licensed Products (it being understood that all such amounts may or may not be deducted in calculating Net Sales).

                "explanation": "The change replaces 'exclusive right' with 'collaborate with CytoDyn' and 'final decision-making authority' with 'consider CytoDyn feedback', completely contradicting the original exclusive control Vyera had over Commercialization. Replacing 'solely and exclusively responsible' with 'jointly decided and reasonably split' significantly alters the financial obligations, and replacing 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' with 'some effort' and the introduction of 'striving for compliance' and 'general compliance' creates ambiguity and weakens enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The term 'shall pay' has been modified to 'shall potentially pay', and 'that could be equivalent to' introducing uncertainty in the mandatory nature of the royalty payment. Other modifications such as 'might be payable commencing upon what Vyera deems to be the First Commercial Sale' and 'what the Parties interpret' turns what was intended to be the clear end-points to subjective interpretation that weakens enforcement and changes contractual obligations.",

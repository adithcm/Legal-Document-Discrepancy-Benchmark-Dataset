                "explanation": "The terms 'Reseller' and 'Distributor' are used interchangeably, but without clearly defining them as the same entity. This could lead to confusion regarding the scope of Schoolpop's responsibilities and rights. Especially in scenarios of exclusivity or liability.",

While 'resell' implies selling to other businesses or intermediaries, 'retail' usually means selling directly to consumers.

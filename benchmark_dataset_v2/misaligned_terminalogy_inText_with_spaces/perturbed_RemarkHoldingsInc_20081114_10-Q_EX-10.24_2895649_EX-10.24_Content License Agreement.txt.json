                "original_text": "1.3 \"Affiliate\" means any distributor or franchisee of HSWI or any company or other entity worldwide, including without limitation corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and limited liability companies in which HSWI directly or indirectly holds at least a 19% ownership, equity, control or financial interest and which HSWI intends to enjoy any of HSWI's rights hereunder. A list of Affiliates as of the Effective Date is attached hereto as Attachment A. Attachment A may be modified from time to time upon notice by HSWI to reflect a revised list of Affiliates and each modified Attachment A shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Affiliates\" to \"Subsidiaries\" in the definition creates confusion because the agreement later refers to 'Affiliates' rights', but now Attachment A is titled Subsidiaries. This introduces a contradiction as it's unclear if 'Affiliates' and 'Subsidiaries' are intended to mean the same entities, leading to potential disputes about which entities the rights granted to Affiliates apply to.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Affiliates\" to \"Associated Parties\" without defining 'Associated Parties' creates ambiguity. Throughout the rest of the document, 'Affiliates' is used, and since Associated Parties is not defined, it is unclear if the indemnification extends to them or only to the entities that were original Affiliates. This uncertainty impacts the scope of the indemnification obligation.",

                "explanation": "Replacing “Affiliates” with “Business Partners” in the definition of HSWI Websites creates ambiguity because “Business Partners” is never defined. Later sections of the contract, such as those regarding license grants and indemnification, refer specifically to HSWI Websites. The change makes it unclear whether websites controlled by entities that were previously considered Affiliates but are now merely Business Partners fall under the same contractual obligations and benefits.",

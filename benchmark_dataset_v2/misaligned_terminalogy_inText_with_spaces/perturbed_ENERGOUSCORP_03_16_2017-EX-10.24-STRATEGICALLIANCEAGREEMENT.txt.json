                "explanation": "Changing 'products' to 'items' introduces ambiguity. Throughout the document, 'Products' refers specifically to the technological outputs of ENERGOUS. By changing it to 'items', it's no longer clear if the contract refers to general goods or the specifically designed technological products. This affects any clause which depends on the term 'Products'.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Specifications' to 'Standards' is an internal contradiction because the term 'Specifications' is defined in Section 1.24. By contrast, 'Standards' is a new term. The change affects Section 11.2 (a), where it is stated the products have to be manufactured based on the 'Approved Production Standards, and as implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Standards'. It's now not clear what standards are referenced, and creates uncertainty in the contractual obligations.",

Section 1.30 defines what Tooling are, and encompasses physical items, as well as software and processes.

                "explanation": "The original definition specifies that the licensed content is sublicensable without extra fees and includes updates. The modified definition omits this requirement and actively restricts modifications, creating a contradiction about the scope and conditions of the 'Licensed Content'.",

Licensor shall also have the right to monitor and censor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",

Licensor has no obligation to monitor or censor content. Licensee must only remove any content deemed illegal by a court of law.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives both Licensor and Licensee the right to censor, and mandates removal of 'offending content', broadening the type of content that could be removed. The modified text removes the Licensor's right, narrows the definition of what must be removed to content deemed illegal, and it is therefore in contradiction with the first statement that has no specification of what content needs to be removed.",

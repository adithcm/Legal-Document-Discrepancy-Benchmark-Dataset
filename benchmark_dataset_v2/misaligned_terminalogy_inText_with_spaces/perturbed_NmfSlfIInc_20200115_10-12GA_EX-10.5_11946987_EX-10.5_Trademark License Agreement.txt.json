                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-transferable, royalty-free right and license to utilize the Trademark in the Territory primarily, but not limited to, as a supplementary aspect of the Licensee's own business name and with respect to the Licensed Services and any business undertaken in conjunction therewith by said Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee is encouraged to leverage the Trademark within the stipulations outlined herein, and unless indicated above, neither the Licensee nor any of its associates, possessors, leaders, functionaries, workers, or representatives shall otherwise employ the Trademark or any modifications thereof without the explicit written approval of the Licensor, at its sole option.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensed Mark' to 'Trademark' without defining 'Trademark' creates ambiguity. Also, changing 'solely and exclusively as a component' to 'primarily, but not limited to, as a supplementary aspect' alters the permitted use and contradicts the original intention of restrictive use. The switch from 'shall use' to 'is encouraged to leverage' creates conflict about the obligations of the Licensee.",

The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by the Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by the Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing. The Licensee agrees to allow the Licensor to conduct reasonable inspection of the quality of the Licensee's services from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "In order to uphold the perceived worth of the Registered Mark, the Licensee pledges to apply best practices to assure the continued operational status and excellence of its commercial activities relative to the prevailing norms within both the Licensor's and Licensee's sectors from the inception of this contractual arrangement. The Licensee additionally consents to utilize the Brand according to those standards as unilaterally determined by the Licensor and communicated orally to the Licensee intermittently, or as mutually understood between both parties verbally on a regular basis. The Licensee will allow for internal audits of its service quality at the Licensor's convenience.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Licensed Mark' to 'Registered Mark' and 'Brand' creates inconsistency. Replacing 'reasonable efforts' with 'best practices' without definition introduces ambiguity. Changing 'in writing' to 'orally' and 'verbally on a regular basis' is contradictory and makes the enforcement subjective. The replacement of 'reasonable inspection' with 'internal audits at the Licensor's convenience' drastically changes the inspection process and introduces subjectivity and lacks specificity.",

The Licensor shall have the exclusive right, but not the obligation, to prosecute, defend and/or settle in its sole discretion, all actions, proceedings and claims involving any Third Party Infringement or Third Party Claim, and to take any other action that it deems necessary or proper for the protection and preservation of its rights in the Licensed Mark. The Licensee shall cooperate with the Licensor in the prosecution, defense or settlement of such actions, proceedings or claims.",
                "changed_text": "Each entity must inform the opposite entity promptly and provide all pertinent contextual details upon recognition of (a) any registrations of, or registration requests for, signage within the Territory that potentially clashes with the Licensor's ownership of the Business Identifier or the permissions extended to the Licensee via this contract, (b) any violations or misapplications of the Business Identifier in the Territory perpetrated by an external source (\"External Party Transgression\") or (c) any allegation that Licensee's application of the Business Identifier breaches the proprietary entitlements of a third entity within the Territory (\"External Party Complaint\"). The Licensor retains the non-compulsory yet sole prerogative to legally pursue, safeguard, and/or resolve, at its own assessment, all legal actions, hearings, and disputes pertaining to an External Party Transgression or External Party Complaint, and to undertake any measure deemed fitting for the protection of its vested rights to the Business Identifier. The Licensee is required to collaborate with the Licensor in the management, defense, or settlement of these legal procedures or conflicts.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'party' to 'entity' and 'Licensed Mark' to 'Business Identifier' without defining 'Business Identifier' leads to confusion. Also, changing 'Third Party Infringement' to 'External Party Transgression' and 'Third Party Claim' to 'External Party Complaint' alters the meaning slightly. Altering 'exclusive right, but not the obligation' to 'non-compulsory yet sole prerogative' makes the intent unclear. Finally, replacing 'cooperate' to 'is required to collaborate' creates issues as to the extent of the obligation.",

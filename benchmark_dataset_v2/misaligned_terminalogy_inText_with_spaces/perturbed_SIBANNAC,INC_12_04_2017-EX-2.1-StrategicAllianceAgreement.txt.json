Promote, market and introduce the product to prospective clients in the government space nationwide.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'non-exclusive project sales lead finder' to 'project referral source' and 'best efforts' to 'reasonable endeavors' weakens Bravatek's obligation. 'Products' is also changed to 'product,' implying a more limited scope. This creates uncertainty regarding Bravatek's exact responsibilities and the scope of what they are marketing.",

The change from 'mutually discussed' to 'discussed by COMPANY' weakens Bravatek's negotiation power and the payment terms.",

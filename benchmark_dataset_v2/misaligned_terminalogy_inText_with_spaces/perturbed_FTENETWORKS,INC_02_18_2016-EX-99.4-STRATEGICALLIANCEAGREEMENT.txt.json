                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall be permitted to subcontract any part of the Work without the prior written notification and consent of EDGE. However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control. All Work performed by a Lower-tier Subcontractor shall be deemed Work performed by Subcontractor. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.",
                "changed_text": "Subcontractor may subcontract any part of the Work at its sole discretion, without any requirement for prior written notification or consent from EDGE. However, the Vendor will adhere to EDGE's general guidelines for subcontracting and offer access to its database of subcontractors. All Work performed by an Associate shall be considered independent work, and EDGE holds no responsibility for it. Subcontractor agrees to not engage Associates whose conduct EDGE might reasonably question.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces conflicting terms by using 'Vendor' and 'Associate' interchangeably with 'Subcontractor' and 'Lower-tier Subcontractor', without clear definitions. It also changes 'requirements and processes' to 'general guidelines,' and shifts the responsibility for the associate work from 'deemed performed by Subcontractor' to 'independent work' with EDGE having no responsibility. This creates uncertainty about the subcontractor's obligations and EDGE's liability.",

B. EDGE may accept any nonconforming Work instead of requiring its removal and correction upon the condition that Subcontractor shall pay EDGE an appropriate amount for damages and compensation as is mutually agreed upon by EDGE and Subcontractor. Warranty is not waived under such conditions. C. If within one (1) year from the date of completion of Work acceptance, or within one (1) year from the completion of all other work or services and acceptance by EDGE (or within any longer materials warranty period as set forth above), any defects exists or arise, then in each case upon receipt of notice of such defect, Subcontractor shall (unless EDGE chooses another remedy) promptly cause such defect(s) to be repaired or remedied at Subcontractor's sole cost and expense, including but not limited to the costs of transportation, uncovering, removal, disposal, replacement, correction, installation and covering. Subcontractor shall commence or cause the commencement of repairs immediately upon receipt of notice from EDGE and thereafter diligently pursue same to completion or cause the same to be diligently pursued to completion. EDGE shall have the right without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to it, (i) to make such repairs and offset the cost thereof against any amounts owed to be paid by EDGE to Subcontractor or invoice Subcontractor therefore which invoice shall be paid net 30 days or (ii) require Subcontractor to refund the price of the Work not meeting the warranties. Subcontractor will extend the warranty period if Subcontractor has been grossly negligent in the performance of any Work under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Subcontractor shall not be liable or responsible for any defect in any materials used by Subcontractor if such defect was not due to Subcontractor's acts or omissions.",
                "changed_text": "The Vendor ensures to EDGE that the Project will be conducted with due care and completed to a degree considered acceptable for similar assignments. B. EDGE retains the option to accept a Project deliverable that does not conform to expectations, provided the Vendor agrees to a reduced rate for the Deliverable. This is not considered a waiver of the Vendor's assurances. C. Should issues arise within ninety (90) days post-Project completion, the Vendor is responsible for investigating such claims. If EDGE elects, the Vendor will collaborate to determine if the issue is related to Vendor's work. Vendor is responsible for its own expenses regarding the investigation. EDGE reserves the right to address the claim if EDGE believes that the Vendor's response is inadequate. Vendor will be assessed the costs incurred by EDGE in remediating the claim. Vendor shall not be liable for materials failures outside its control.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'Subcontractor' with 'Vendor', and 'Work' with 'Project' and 'Deliverable', but more importantly, it significantly alters the warranty terms. The original text states that Subcontractor must repair defects at its sole cost, while the modified text states that the 'Vendor' is only responsible for investigating the claim and has to collaborate with EDGE to determine if it is related to the project. Furthermore, the original warranty period of one year is shortened to ninety days. The shift in responsibility and shorter time frame creates confusion and limits the Vendor's liability.",

Each party shall pay its own legal and other costs relating to the mediation or the non- binding arbitration regardless of the outcome of the mediation or the non-binding arbitration. 27. LEGAL JURISDICTION/ VENUE The Parties: (a) consent to the exclusive venue the State of Texas, Collin County, in any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement including the jurisdiction and venue in connection with Paragraph 26 : TEXAS ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT; (b) waive any objection they might have to jurisdiction or venue of such forums or that the forum is inconvenient; and (c) agree not to bring any such action in any other jurisdiction or venue to which either party might be entitled by domicile or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "All claims and controversies arising out of this agreement, except those waived by final payment, must be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitratorâ€™s decision shall be final and binding on both parties. Each participant shall bear its expenses associated with the arbitration, but the expense of the arbitrator shall be split equally. 27. LEGAL JURISDICTION/ VENUE The Parties: (a) agree that the location for resolving disputes shall be New York, New York; (b) acknowledge that either party may disagree with jurisdiction or venue of such forums or that the forum is inconvenient; and (c) agree to bring any such action in any other jurisdiction or venue to which either party might be entitled by domicile or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the dispute resolution process. The original text mandates mediation or non-binding arbitration in Texas, while the modified text requires mandatory binding arbitration under AAA rules. The location is also shifted to New York. This creates a direct contradiction regarding how disputes will be resolved and where they will be resolved, making the agreement unenforceable on this matter.",

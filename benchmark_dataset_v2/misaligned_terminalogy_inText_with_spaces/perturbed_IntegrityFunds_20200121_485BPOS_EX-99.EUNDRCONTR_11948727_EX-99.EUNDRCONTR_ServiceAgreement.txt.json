                "original_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund will consider to pay Integrity a possible sum of money related to distribution and/or assistance based on the Shareholder Support Program (the \"Plan\") approved by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall also pay' to 'will consider to pay' introduces ambiguity about the Fund's payment obligation. This contradicts the original text, which establishes a mandatory payment.",

                "explanation": "Changing the language in the continuity agreement to use the word 'Advisors', 'vested benefits', and 'simple vote' and from 'Trustees', 'financial interest', and 'vote of a majority' makes the agreement and its continuation vague and less formal, losing all the original meaning.",

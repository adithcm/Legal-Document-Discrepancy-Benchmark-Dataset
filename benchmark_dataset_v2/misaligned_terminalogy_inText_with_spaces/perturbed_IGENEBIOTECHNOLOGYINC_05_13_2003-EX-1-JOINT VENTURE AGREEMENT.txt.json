Upon receipt of an Offer Notice, the other Party must elect prior to the expiration of twenty-one days either to (a) sell its interest in the Operating Company for the Offer Price or (b) purchase the interest of the Party providing the Offer Notice for the Offer Price, which election in either case may be in a written notice which also specifies which of the closing dates identified in the notice delivered to such Party is preferred by such Party.

If any Board Dispute is not resolved through the procedure set forth in Article 22.1 after expiration of all of the time specified therefor, either Party, in the thirty day period beginning upon the end of the twenty day period described in Article 22.1, can choose to provide the other Party with a written notice (the \"Offer Notice\") stating that such Board Dispute is not resolved and setting forth a price (the \"Offer Price\") and a list of three acceptable closing dates not less than ninety days after the expiration of the twenty-one day period referred to in the next sentence; provided, that an Offer Notice may not be served earlier than (i) with respect to a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(a) (General Manager Appointment), 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) (except as provided in subclause (ii) below), eighteen months from the Commencement Date, (ii) a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(b) (Capital Expenditures) or 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) that involves a contemplated expenditure which can be financed solely by the Joint Venture from its internal resources and/or using funds provided on normal commercial terms by any other party without any contribution or guaranty from either Party, eighteen months from the Commencement Date and (iii) with respect to any other Board Dispute, fifty-four months from the Effective Date.

                "explanation": "The original text enforces a strict right to provide a written notice as well as a strict obligation to elect prior to the expiration of twenty-one days. The modified version changes the word 'may' for 'can choose to' to the first phrase, weakening this right. Also it changes the word 'must' for 'should consider to', weakening the obligation to elect. Finally, in the last phrase, the original enforces an strict obligation with 'shall consummate' and the modified version changes it to 'shall endeavor to consummate'. This causes uncertainty in the enforcement of this obligation and creates a contradiction of the original agreement.",

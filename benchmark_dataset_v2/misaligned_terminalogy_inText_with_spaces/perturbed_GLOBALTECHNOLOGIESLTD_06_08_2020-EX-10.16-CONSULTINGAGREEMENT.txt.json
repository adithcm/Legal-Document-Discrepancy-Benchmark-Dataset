As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition.",

As Contractor's entire monetary reward for its performance under this agreement, the Corporation shall pay the Independent Agent $250,000,00 cash payment. In addition, the Independent Agent shall be eligible for another payment for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019.

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Consultant' with 'Independent Agent', 'Company' with 'Corporation' and 'compensation' to 'monetary reward' further confuses the contract. The contract now uses both the original and the new terms, making it ambiguous who is entitled to what compensation. This leads to legal disputes regarding payouts and responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Referencing 'the Company' in conjunction with 'Independent Agent' now adds ambiguity to responsibilities. Earlier, the Company was changed to the Corporation, which generates inconsistencies in who bears liability and indemnification for taxes and legal compliance. It's questionable whether the terms match, which complicates legal responsibilities.",

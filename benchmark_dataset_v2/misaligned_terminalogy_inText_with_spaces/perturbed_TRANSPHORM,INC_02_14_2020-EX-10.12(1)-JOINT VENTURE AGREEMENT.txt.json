                "explanation": "The term 'determined by the Parties' in section 5.2.1 has been replaced by 'at AFSL's discretion.' While the former suggests that the terms and conditions should be mutually decided, the latter gives AFSL unilateral power over these terms. This is an internal contradiction that could lead to disputes.",

During the term of this Agreement, TPH-A/TPH shall be responsible for the costs and expenses agreed by the Parties to maintain and/or procure the equipment for wafer processing specified in the Appendix 2 attached hereto and as amended from time to time upon the mutual agreement of the Parties (the \"GaN Equipment\"). At TPH's sole option, TPH or TPH-A may purchase the GaN Equipment by completion of payment of the purchase price or depreciation cost for such equipment as set forth in Appendix 2. In such case: (i) TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, shall acquire sole and exclusive title to the GaN Equipment, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and none of FSL, AFSL or the Company shall have any right, title or interest in such GaN Equipment, (ii) such GaN Equipment shall be clearly labeled as the property of TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, and (iii) FSL and AFSL shall cause to be assigned to TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, all licenses and warranties for such GaN Equipment and the software or firmware required to operate such GaN Equipment that are attached to, installed on, or embodied in such GaN Equipment as of the Effective Date. During the term if this Agreement, the GaN Equipment shall be used exclusively in GaN wafer processing, and shall not be used in the silicon wafer processing for AFSL's or FSL's current products. In the event that the Company needs to use the GaN Equipment to provide products or services to any customer other than TPH- A or TPH or their Affiliates prior to the Put Closing Date or the Call Closing Date, the Company shall reimburse TPH-A or TPH for the use of such equipment in the manner to be discussed in good faith and agreed upon by the Parties, which reimbursement may be offset against amounts otherwise owing from TPH-A or TPH, as the case may be, to the Company.",

                "explanation": "In the first sentence, the condition 'upon the mutual agreement of the Parties' for amending the GaN equipment has been changed to 'at TPH's discretion', allowing for unilateral modification. Also, 'in the manner to be discussed in good faith and agreed upon by the Parties' was replaced with 'based on TPH's determination of value' for the terms of usage and reimbursement, giving TPH complete control over determining the terms and rates for reimbursement and usage. The contract now contradicts itself on how the usage is determined, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

The modified text removes this restriction, making the right to terminate available to any party, even if they were responsible for the delay. This directly contradicts the original intention and introduces uncertainty about who can terminate the agreement and under what circumstances.",

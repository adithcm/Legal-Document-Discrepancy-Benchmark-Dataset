Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this Agreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",

Additional products of the Company can be included as Specified Products during the Contract Period at the Company's sole discretion. All additions to Specified Products do not need any signatures from any party of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Licensed Products' is replaced with 'Specified Products' in the definition, but the contract continues to use 'Licensed Products' elsewhere. This creates confusion. Also, the change of including products at Company's sole discretion creates contradictions with the original agreement.",

Payments will be determined and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter based on sales at the sole discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "The term 'donation' is changed to 'fee' and 'Licensed Products' is replaced with 'Company Products', creating uncertainty about whether all company products or only licensed products are subject to the fee. Also, the payment of the fee is made discretionary for the Company, directly conflicting with the mandatory language in the original agreement.",

This makes enforcement of reporting obligations nearly impossible.",

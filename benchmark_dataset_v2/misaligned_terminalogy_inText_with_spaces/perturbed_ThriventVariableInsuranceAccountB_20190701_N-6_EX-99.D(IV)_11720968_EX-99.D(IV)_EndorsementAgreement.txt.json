Is amended to read: We, we, Our, our, Us, us. Thrivent Financial for Lutherans. In some cases, \"we\" refers to Thrivent Life Insurance, depending on context.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'In some cases, \"we\" refers to Thrivent Life Insurance, depending on context' creates ambiguity and contradicts the previous amendments that clearly state 'We, Our, Us' now refers to 'Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.' This creates uncertainty about which entity is responsible at different points in the contract.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society' to just 'Articles of Incorporation', and then adding 'The bylaws are subject to change and may affect the contract' introduces contradiction. The original statement explicitly includes bylaws as part of the entire contract and protects against future reductions. The edited text suggests bylaws are external and can affect benefits despite the previous assurance, creating uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'in accordance with our bylaws' with 'subject to approval by the Society's management team' introduces an undefined and potentially arbitrary process for contract transfer. This contradicts the initial, more defined process of following the bylaws and adds another layer of uncertainty. The term 'management team' is undefined. It is also not clear what the criteria is for approval. This change now empowers the management team to create an opaque decision-making process, deviating from the original terms that were grounded in the bylaws.",

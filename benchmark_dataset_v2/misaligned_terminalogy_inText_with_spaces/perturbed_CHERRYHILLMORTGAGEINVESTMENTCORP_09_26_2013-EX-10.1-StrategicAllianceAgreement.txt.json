Acknowledgement Agreement: The Acknowledgement Agreement to be entered into by Freedom Mortgage, as Issuer, Cherry Hill, as Secured Party, and the Government National Mortgage Association.",

Acknowledgement Agreement: The Agreement to be entered into by Freedom Mortgage, as Obligor, Cherry Hill, as Lienholder, and the Government National Mortgage Association.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Issuer' to 'Obligor' and 'Secured Party' to 'Lienholder' creates confusion. The definition of 'Acknowledgement Agreement' now references terms that deviate from the standard terminology used in financial contexts. It is unclear whether 'Obligor' and 'Lienholder' are synonyms or have different implications, creating uncertainty regarding the agreement's scope and obligations.",

While these terms are often used interchangeably, their specific legal implications can vary. This could lead to disputes regarding the specific duties and liabilities assigned to each party under the 'Flow Agreement.'",

The original terms are precisely defined within a financial context, while the modified terms are more ambiguous. This could lead to disputes over whether a 'Standby Trigger Event' has occurred, especially if 'Financial Stability' and 'liquid assets' are interpreted differently than 'Tangible Net Worth' and 'cash and cash equivalents', respectively.",

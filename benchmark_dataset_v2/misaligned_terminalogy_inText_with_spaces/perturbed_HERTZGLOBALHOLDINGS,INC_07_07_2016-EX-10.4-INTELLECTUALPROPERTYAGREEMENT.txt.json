HERC shall promptly notify HSI of the use of any mark by any third party which HERC considers might be an infringement or passing off of any HERTZ or HERTZ-formative intellectual property used by or licensed to HERC pursuant 6 to the terms hereof or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. However, HSI shall have the sole right to decide whether or not proceedings shall be brought against such third parties. In the event that HSI decides that action should be taken against such third parties, HSI may take such action either in its own name or, alternatively, HSI may authorize HERC to initiate such action in HERC's name. In any event, the Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary to prosecute such action, all expenses being borne by the Party bringing such action and all damages which may be recovered being solely for the account of that Party.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation changes 'HSI' to 'THC' in the section detailing who decides on infringement proceedings. This creates an ambiguity because HSI is defined as the owner of trademarks, but THC is given the power to decide on enforcement, which conflicts with the established roles of each entity.",

                "explanation": "The original clause allowed both THC and HSI to terminate the agreement upon a material breach. By removing HSI's right to terminate, the clause now implies that only THC can terminate, even though HSI is a party with significant rights and obligations under the agreement. This creates a contradiction because it weakens HSI's enforcement power.",

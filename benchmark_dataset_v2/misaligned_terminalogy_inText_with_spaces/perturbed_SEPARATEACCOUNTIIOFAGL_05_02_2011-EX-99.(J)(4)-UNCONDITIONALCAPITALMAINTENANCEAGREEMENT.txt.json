                "explanation": "The term 'Company' is replaced with 'Institution' in the first part of the sentence, but not throughout. This creates confusion as to whether 'Company' and 'Institution' are intended to be the same entity and whether AIG's obligation applies to both or only one, which impacts the certainty of enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the previous change, 'Company' is replaced with 'Institution' in parts of the initial clause, but inconsistently. The reference to 'Company' remains in other parts of the same sentence. This makes the obligations related to Total Adjusted Capital ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple conflicting ways. This ambiguity regarding the entity's financial status affects dividend payout obligations and approval requirements, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Here, the first instance of 'Company' is changed to 'Business' leaving all subsequent instances of the word Company unchanged. This makes unclear whether the rights given to a 'Business' policyholder, or a 'Company' policyholder and whether either is interchangeable to the original entity. This confusion impacts who is a policyholder and who can enforce the agreement, making it significantly difficult to be enforced.",

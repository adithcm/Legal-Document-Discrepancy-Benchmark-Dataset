The Royalty is in consideration of your right to use the Proprietary Marks and the System in accordance with this Agreement, and not in exchange for any specific services we render. If by reason of state or other law, we are prohibited from receiving a percentage of certain components of Gross Revenues (including alcoholic-beverage sales), you must pay us an equivalent amount by increasing the Royalty percentage applied to Gross Revenues exclusive of the prohibited components.",

                "explanation": "The original section defines the Royalty. The change substitutes 'Royalty' with 'Franchise Fee' in subsequent instances, creating uncertainty about whether both terms are synonymous or distinct obligations. This directly contradicts the initial definition of Royalty.",

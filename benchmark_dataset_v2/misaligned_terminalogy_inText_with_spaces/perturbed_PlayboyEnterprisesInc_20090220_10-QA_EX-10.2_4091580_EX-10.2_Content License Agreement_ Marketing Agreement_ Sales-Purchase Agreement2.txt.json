The 'Supplier' is instructed to deliver to 'Customer' if requested by the 'Client' but destruction must happen in the presence of the original 'Purchaser'. If 'Client', 'Purchaser', and 'Customer' are separate entities, these obligations could cause logistical problems and disputes regarding compliance with contract terms. It is unclear which entity has the authority to request delivery or oversee destruction, creating potential for disagreements and non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Financial Leasing Agreement' and 'Vehicle Lease Agreement' are used interchangeably, while 'liquidated damages' are replaced by 'cancellation fees.' This inconsistency creates confusion regarding the agreement's conditions and obligations. Also, the number of advance days, payment, depreciation expense and other key terms such as whether the agreement needs to be explained have been modified in order to be contradictory and uncertain in enforcement.",

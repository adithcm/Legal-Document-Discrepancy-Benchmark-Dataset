AVDU shall be solely responsible for making all payments to and on behalf of its employees and UTK shall in no event be liable for any debts or other liabilities of AVDU.",

AVDU shall be solely responsible for making all payments to and on behalf of its personnel and UTK shall in no event be liable for any debts or other liabilities of AVDU.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'employees' to 'personnel' introduces ambiguity. While 'employees' has a defined legal meaning, 'personnel' is broader and could include independent contractors. This creates a contradiction: UTK is an independent contractor, but AVDU is responsible for payments to UTK *if* UTK is considered 'personnel' of AVDU under this clause.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'employees' to 'staff' introduces ambiguity. 'Staff' can be interpreted more broadly than 'employees' potentially encompassing contractors or other non-employee workers. The second usage of employee remains.

                "explanation": "The change from 'employee' to 'contractor' for AVDU, but keeping 'employee' for UTK introduces a contradiction. It implies different restrictions for each party. It is unclear if AVDU is restricted from hiring former UTEK contractors who used to be UTEK employees.",

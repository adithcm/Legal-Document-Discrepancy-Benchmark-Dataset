The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.

The total sum of revenue share shall be a percentage of the profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, as determined by Party A. Party B shall only adjust the amount of the cooperation fee with the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries. Party A shall cause its subsidiaries to pay the cooperation fee in respect of Party B's Services provided to such subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The terms \"Service Fee\" and \"revenue share\" are used interchangeably without clear definition. Initially, the Service Fee is equal to the total profits, and Party B can adjust it. Then, the total sum is defined as a percentage and Party B's ability to adjust is restricted. This creates confusion about how Party B is compensated.",

                "explanation": "The introduction of \"Party B's Offerings\" as a collective term while still referencing \"Party B's Services\" later in the same paragraph creates confusion as to whether these terms are interchangeable or refer to distinct sets of obligations. In addition, the last sentence now references purchase of \"required products\" when it was referring to Party B's Services previously. This creates an ambiguity as to if Party B can purchase products.",

                "explanation": "Changing the term \"Intellectual Property\" to \"Assets\" in the definition part of this clause makes the definition no longer align with the text preceding it.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'LMG Tools'.

                "original_text": "Retained LMG Personnel. LMG shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the employment of the LMG employees identified in Exhibit B (\"Retained Employees\") for the estimated retention period specified in Exhibit B or such other period as TAG may reasonably request (\"Retention Period\"). LMG shall cause them to devote the same amount of time and attention to the performance of the services under this Agreement as they presently devote to such services.  In all events, LMG shall retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to perform the LMG Services. The Retained Employees shall be employees of LMG for all purposes.  LMG shall be solely responsible for funding and distributing benefits under the benefit plans in which the Retained Employees participate and for paying any compensation and remitting any income, disability, withholding and other employment taxes for such Retained Employees. For clarity, the foregoing shall not affect TAG's obligation to reimburse LMG for the costs specifically identified as reimbursable by TAG during the period, and under the terms and conditions, set forth in  Sections 4.1 and  4.2 of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Designated Staff. LMG shall endeavor to maintain the involvement of the individuals detailed in Exhibit B (\"Designated Staff\") for the duration outlined in Exhibit B or as otherwise requested by TAG (“Service Period”). LMG shall ensure these individuals allocate a comparable level of effort to the services under this Agreement as their current allocation. However, LMG's obligation is limited to ensuring a workforce capable of delivering the LMG Services, irrespective of the specific individuals involved. The Designated Staff will be deemed independent contractors for the purpose of this agreement and not employees of LMG. LMG shall bear sole responsibility for managing payments to these individuals, but TAG shall be responsible for covering any statutory deductions related to payments made during the Service Period as defined in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates ambiguity around the status of personnel. Originally, 'Retained Employees' are clearly defined as employees of LMG, with LMG responsible for all employment-related obligations. The modified version refers to them as 'Designated Staff', redefines them as independent contractors for the agreement, and shifts responsibility for statutory deductions to TAG. This contradicts established employment law principles and creates potential legal and financial disputes.",

                "original_text": "Compliance with Laws. In the performance of LMG Services or the provision of LMG Tools and Documentation pursuant to this Agreement, LMG shall comply with the requirements of all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the United States or any state, country, or other governmental entity. LMG shall indemnify, defend, and hold TAG harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, or damages arising from or caused by LMG's failure to comply with the foregoing.",
                "changed_text": "Regulatory Adherence. During the provision of LMG Services, and LMG Tools and Documentation in compliance with this agreement, LMG will endeavor to abide by all applicable rules, mandates, and edicts within the United States, or any other relevant jurisdiction or regulatory body. LMG shall be responsible for its failure to comply with the above stated requirements unless directly caused by an action of TAG.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens LMG's obligation to comply with laws. The original text imposes a strict compliance obligation and indemnification for any failure. The modified version softens the language to 'endeavor to abide by', which suggests a lower standard of care. Moreover, removes LMG's obligation for its non-compliance if caused by an action of TAG.",

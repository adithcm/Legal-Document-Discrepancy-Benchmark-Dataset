Boyd Enterprises, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, whose principal  place of business is located at 2003 Navasota Cove, Westlake, Texas, referred to in this Agreement as \"Company\" or \"Boyd\", and Cano Petroleum,  Inc., a Delaware corporation qualified to transact business in Texas, whose principal place of business is located at 801 Cherry Street, Suite 3200,  Fort Worth, Texas 76102, referred to in this agreement as \"Sponsor\" or \"Cano\".",

Boyd Enterprises, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, whose principal place of business is located at 2003 Navasota Cove, Westlake, Texas, referred to in this Agreement as \"Company\" or \"Boyd\", and Cano Petroleum, Inc., a Delaware corporation qualified to transact business in Texas, whose principal place of business is located at 801 Cherry Street, Suite 3200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102, referred to in this agreement as \"Advertiser\" or \"Cano\".",

                "explanation": "Changing 'lead sponsor' to 'title sponsor' creates an ambiguity. It is unclear whether 'lead sponsor' and 'title sponsor' have the same meaning, potentially affecting the scope of rights Cano acquires. Also, referring to the Company now as \"Advertiser\", which conflicts with the 'Sponsor' definition later in the document, causes confusion.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'signage' to 'advertisements' introduces a subtle shift that could lead to disputes. 'Signage' typically refers to brand displays, whereas 'advertisements' encompass a broader range of promotional materials. This lack of clarity can cause problems in interpreting the allowable promotional activities for CANO.",

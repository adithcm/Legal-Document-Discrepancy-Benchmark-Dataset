Duties of the Sponsor. Subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Sponsor shall perform such oversight, administrative and management services as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Trust, which shall include without limitation: (a) maintaining office facilities (which may be in the office of Domini or an affiliate) and furnishing clerical services necessary for maintaining the organization of the Trust and for performing the oversight, administrative and management functions herein set forth",

The Trust shall pay all of its operating expenses, including but not limited to fees due the Sponsor under this Agreement, compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Sponsor, governmental fees, including but not limited to Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state \"blue sky\" fees; interest charges; taxes and related charges; membership dues of the Trust in the Investment Company Institute and other professional or industry associations; fees and expenses of the Trust's independent auditors and accountants, of legal counsel and any transfer agent, distributor, shareholder servicing agent, recordkeeper, registrar or dividend disbursing agent of the Trust",

                "explanation": "Using 'Service Provider' and 'Investment Manager' interchangeably with 'Sponsor' leads to contradiction. It becomes unclear whether the Trust pays fees to all three, or if they refer to the same entity but are being named differently for unknown reasons. The sentence \"compensation of Trustees not affiliated with the Investment Manager\", in particular, is dubious and contradictory.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Sponsor' to 'Investment Manager' and the notice period from 60 to 30 days, the termination clause now contradicts itself regarding which party can terminate the agreement and with how much notice. This creates significant ambiguity in how the contract can be legally terminated, potentially leading to disputes.",

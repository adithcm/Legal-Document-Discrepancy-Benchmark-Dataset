After official approval from the Company, the customer introduced by Distributor, will appear on an official list in this contract, and will only be met by the Distributor and will follow the rules of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Company desires to appoint Distributor as its exclusive distributor of the Products to all Clients that Distributor introduce, and upon confirmed the first order, this client come to be exclusive of Distributor, every new purchaser introduced by Distributor, may or may not require approval by the company prior to any sale. All new purchasers introduced by Distributor, at the Company's discretion, may appear on an official list, but this is not guaranteed, and may or may not be exclusively met by the Distributor following the rules of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Client' and 'purchaser' are used interchangeably, creating ambiguity as to whether they refer to the same entity. This introduces contradiction by modifying the obligations of approval and exclusivity of those introduced by the distributor, making it discretionary instead of mandatory, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. Previously the term 'must' was used but this has been replaced by 'may or may not require approval'.",

                "explanation": "The term 'sub-distributor' is replaced by 'associate distributor,' which is not defined in the contract. 'Associate distributor' introduces a conflicting compensation clause and the essential rights to which the distributor is entitled under the agreement, creating ambiguity. This could give the impression that the company can alter the essential rights outlined in the agreement.",

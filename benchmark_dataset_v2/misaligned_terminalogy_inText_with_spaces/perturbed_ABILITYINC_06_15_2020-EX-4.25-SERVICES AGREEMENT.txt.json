                "explanation": "The term 'Provider' is replaced with 'Vendor' and 'Services' with 'Deliverables' in the Recitals section, creating uncertainty. While 'Provider' and 'Services' are defined terms later in the agreement, using 'Vendor' and 'Deliverables' here introduces an inconsistency, and it remains unclear whether the 'Vendor' is the same as the 'Provider' defined later.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Provider' is replaced with 'Supplier'. This creates confusion as to whether 'Supplier' and 'Provider' refer to the same entity. The agreement does not define 'Supplier', so it is unclear if the obligations placed upon the 'Provider' also apply to the 'Supplier'.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Parties' is replaced with 'Signatories,' and 'Confidential Information' is replaced with 'Proprietary Information.' This creates ambiguity because the contract defines 'Parties' and 'Confidential Information' explicitly, but it never defines 'Signatories' or 'Proprietary Information'. It is unclear whether the obligations pertaining to confidentiality apply in the same way to the potentially broader scope of 'Proprietary Information.'",

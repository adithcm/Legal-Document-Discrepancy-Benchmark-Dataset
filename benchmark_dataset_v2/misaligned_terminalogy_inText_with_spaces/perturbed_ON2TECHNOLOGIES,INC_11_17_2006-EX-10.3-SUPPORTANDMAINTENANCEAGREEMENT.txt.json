                "explanation": "The original text explicitly excludes \"Licensed Assets\" from \"Incorporated Technology Works,\" while the modified text includes them. Also the term 'means Two Hundred Eighty Thousand shares of Common Stock' is changed to 'refers to shares of Common Stock determined at the discretion of On2, not necessarily Two Hundred Eighty Thousand.' This creates uncertainty about what constitutes \"Incorporated Technology Works\" and number of 'Payment Shares'.",

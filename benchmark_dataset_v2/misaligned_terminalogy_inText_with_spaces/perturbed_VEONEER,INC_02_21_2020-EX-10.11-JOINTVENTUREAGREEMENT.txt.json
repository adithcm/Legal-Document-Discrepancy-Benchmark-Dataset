                "explanation": "Changing \"Company\" or \"Companies\" to \"Entity\" or \"Entities\" in section b. creates a contradiction. While seemingly similar, the contract uses 'Company' as a defined term. Using 'Entity' in section b. introduces uncertainty about whether 'Entity' refers to the same scope of organizations as 'Company,' potentially altering the interpretation of obligations after the VNBZ Closing.",

It is not clear who or what constitutes an associate or what a guarantee/undertaking/understanding is. This will cause serious legal problems due to conflicting definitions.",

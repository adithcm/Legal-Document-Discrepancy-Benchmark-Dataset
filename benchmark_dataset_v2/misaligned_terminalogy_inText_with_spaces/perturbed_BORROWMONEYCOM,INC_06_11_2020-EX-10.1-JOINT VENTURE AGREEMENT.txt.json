                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "By this Agreement the Members enter into a joint venture (the \"Venture\") in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The rights and obligations of the Members will be as stated in the applicable legislation of the State of Florida (the \"Act\") except as otherwise provided here.",
                "changed_text": "By this Agreement the Members enter into a joint venture (the \"Venture\") in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. The rights and obligations of the Members will be as stated in the applicable legislation of the State of Delaware (the \"Act\") except as otherwise provided here.",
                "explanation": "The 'Act' is initially defined as the laws of Florida but is then changed to the laws of Delaware. This creates a contradiction, as the venture is stated to be formed under Florida law, but then governed by Delaware law, causing uncertainty on which jurisdiction's laws apply.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Capital Contribution' is changed to 'Initial Investment' in the opening sentence of the capital contribution section, but then the table still references 'Capital Contribution'. This creates a contradiction about what the initial capital is formally called, and may be confusing in later sections referring to it.",

                "explanation": "The phrases 'the Venture' and 'Joint Venture' are initially used interchangeably, but the term 'third party' is replaced with 'external entity'. The change creates uncertainty about the scope of confidentiality, especially if 'external entity' is interpreted differently from 'third party', thereby impacting information disclosure obligations.",

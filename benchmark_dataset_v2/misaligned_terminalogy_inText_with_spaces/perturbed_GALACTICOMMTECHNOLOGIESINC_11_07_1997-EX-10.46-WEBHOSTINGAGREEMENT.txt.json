                "original_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to remit to Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses. Beyond that point, the fee will be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment is expected to submit payment to Galacticomm by no later than the middle of the week for accesses accrued during the previous week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "explanation": "The terms 'pay' and 'remit' are used interchangeably without clarifying if they have different financial implications or processes. Additionally, 'send this amount' is replaced with 'submit payment', and 'Wednesday' is softened to 'the middle of the week,' creating ambiguity and potential for delayed payments.",

                "changed_text": "Galacticomm will ensure a technician is available to address any system malfunctions (Server unavailability or inaccessibility) around the clock. Said technician must be reachable via pager or phone.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'person(s)' and 'technician' are used interchangeably. While they may seem similar, 'technician' implies a certain skill set not necessarily implied by 'person(s).' Also, 'technical problems' is changed to 'system malfunctions,' and 'Server being down or inaccessible' is changed to 'Server unavailability or inaccessibility', without defining if they mean the same, leading to confusion.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'terminate this agreement' and 'cancel this contract' are used interchangeably. While they seem similar the new wording weakens Horst's right by using the word 'option' instead of 'right', creating an inconsistency. Also the terms 'software' and 'program' are interchanged without defining whether or not they are the same.",

                "explanation": "The term 'entrusted party' is replaced with 'agent'. This creates confusion because the contract consistently uses 'entrusted party' elsewhere, potentially invalidating actions taken by the 'agent'.

PAYMENT: Under Letter of Credit or T/T: Under the Letter of Credit: The Buyer shall open an irrevocable letter of credit with the bank within 30 days after signing the contract, in favor of the Seller, for 100% value of the total contract value. The letter of credit should state that partial shipments are allowed. The Buyer's agent agrees to pay for the goods in accordance with the actual amount of the goods shipped. 80% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.1. The remaining 20% of the system value being shipped will be paid against the documents stipulated in Clause 12.2. The Letter of Credit shall be valid until 90 days after the latest shipment is effected. Under the T/T The trustee of the buyer remitted the goods to the seller by telegraphic transfer in batches as agreed upon after signing each order.",

It is unclear whether these terms are referring to the same entity, making the payment obligations potentially unenforceable because it could be argued that the 'Buyer' and 'Purchaser' are separate parties, creating uncertainty about who is actually responsible for opening the letter of credit or remitting payments.",

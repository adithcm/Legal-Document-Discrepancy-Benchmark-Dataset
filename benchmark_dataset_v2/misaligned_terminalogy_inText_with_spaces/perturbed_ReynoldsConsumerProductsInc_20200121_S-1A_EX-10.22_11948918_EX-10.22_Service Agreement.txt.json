In later sections, only the word \"Recipient\" is used. This creates confusion since the changed term may not be interpreted in the same way by both parties.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the services should be performed in accordance with applicable law. The modified text introduces the term 'industry best practices' which can deviate from 'applicable law', leading to contradictions about legal and quality obligations. The definition of 'Service Standard' now uses the term 'industry best practices' instead of 'applicable Law'.",

                "explanation": "The modified text swaps 'Provider' with 'Vendor' and 'Recipient' with 'Consumer', and eliminates the obligation to remedy the failure in the same manner as the provider would for its own business. This introduces ambiguity about which entity is responsible for which actions, and what standards are to be followed in the fixing of failures. The terms “Provider” and “Consumer” from the beginning are changed here to new terms but no definition is provided.",

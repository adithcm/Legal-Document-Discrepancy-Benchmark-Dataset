                "explanation": "The introduction of 'Customer' as a separate term from 'User,' even though they are both accessing and using the Co-Branded Site's services, introduces ambiguity. Are all Users Customers? Are all Customers Users? This can lead to confusion about which party is subject to specific clauses later in the contract.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Users' to 'Visitors' creates an issue. Section 1.22 defines User and there is no 'Visitor' definition. It is ambiguous whether this means something different and if the rights granted in this paragraph are narrower/broader. Also the change of the access from 'personal use' to 'any use' without specifying the Impresse's standard license agreement creates uncertainty in the contract enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'reasonable efforts to cure' to 'commercially reasonable efforts to resolve' for Impresse, introduces ambiguity as to the expected standard.

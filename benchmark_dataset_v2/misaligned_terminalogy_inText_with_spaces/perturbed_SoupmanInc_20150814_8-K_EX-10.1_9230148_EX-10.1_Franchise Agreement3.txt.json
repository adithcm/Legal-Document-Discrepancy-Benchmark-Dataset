                "explanation": "The change from 'Master Franchise Agreement' to 'Franchise Agreement' introduces ambiguity. It is unclear whether 'Franchise Agreement' refers to the same agreement as 'Master Franchise Agreement'. This leads to uncertainty in the overall agreement enforcement, as the controlling document is now ambiguous.",

Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'Master Franchise Agreement' to 'Franchise Contract,' and keeping 'franchise agreement' later in the same paragraph, this creates uncertainty. It is no longer clear if the mediation requirement applies to the same agreement referenced in the advice to prospective franchisees. This creates an internal contradiction in whether mediation is always required.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'franchise' to 'sub-franchise' implies the existence of two distinct types of franchises, which is not defined within the document, which could create a contradiction. The legal consequences outlined in the latter part of the sentence may not apply equally to both types of franchises, leading to potential disputes and enforcement problems, as the term's exact meaning is not explicitly defined.",

                "original_text": "Sicap Ltd provides to EuroTel a standard service for the SICAP(R) PPB, VCA and OTA modules.\n\n      EuroTel can also request additional support which is not part of the       offered standard support and is subject to a separate quotation and       ordering procedure as described in Article 5.",
                "changed_text": "Sicap Ltd provides to EuroTel a standard service for the SICAP(R) PPB, VCA and OTA modules.\n\n      EuroTel can also request supplementary assistance which is considered included within the standard service offering, though a separate pricing structure might apply as per Article 5.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'additional support' and 'supplementary assistance' are used interchangeably, but the modified text contradicts itself by stating that supplementary assistance is 'considered included within the standard service offering,' while also mentioning a 'separate pricing structure.' This creates confusion about whether the support is actually free or subject to extra charges, undermining the clarity of the contract.",

In case of an obvious       misuse, Sicap Ltd has the right to charge the costs.\n\n      Sicap Ltd will perform every possibility to make the system running as       soon as possible. Staff of EuroTel must be on-site on request of Sicap       Ltd.",
                "changed_text": "It is up to EuroTel to decide which priority occurs. In case of an obvious       abuse, Sicap Ltd retains the prerogative to bill for associated expenses.\n\n      Sicap Ltd will endeavor to restore system functionality expediently. EuroTel employees are expected to be present at the physical location if requested by Sicap Ltd.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'misuse' to 'abuse', 'right to charge the costs' to 'prerogative to bill for associated expenses', 'perform every possibility' to 'endeavor to restore system functionality expediently' and 'staff' to 'employees' introduces ambiguity. While seemingly similar, the legal implications differ. 'Abuse' implies intentional wrongdoing, while 'misuse' can be unintentional, making it harder to prove. Also, 'prerogative to bill for associated expenses' suggests a discretionary charge, not a guaranteed fee as implied by the original 'right to charge the costs'.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Change Management' and 'Modifications Handling', 'RFC' and 'Modification Requests', 'quotation and schedule' and 'proposal and timeline', 'weekly basis' and 'bi-weekly', 'accept or decline' and 'endorsement or rejection', 'implemented change' and 'finalized alteration' are changed and introduced subtly, but the shift from 'weekly basis' to 'bi-weekly' creates a contradiction regarding the frequency of communication, making it unclear how often EuroTel will be updated on the progress.",

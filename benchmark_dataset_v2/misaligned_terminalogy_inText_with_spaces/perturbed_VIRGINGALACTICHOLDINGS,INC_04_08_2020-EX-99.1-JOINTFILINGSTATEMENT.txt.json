                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent revisions to this statement on Schedule 13G may be filed on behalf of the group of signatories without the need for further joint acquisition statements.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'amendments' and 'revisions' are used interchangeably. Also, 'necessity' is replaced with 'need' and 'each of the undersigned' with 'group of signatories'. This creates ambiguity on whether each signatory has individual filing obligations, or if a group filing suffices for every change, even if individual circumstances differ.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'filing' is swapped with 'submission', 'timely' with 'periodic', 'amendments' with 'revisions', 'completeness and accuracy' with 'overall correctness', 'information' with 'data', 'contained' with 'present', 'responsible' with 'accountable', 'inaccurate' with 'flawed'. This introduces ambiguity regarding the degree and type of responsibility. 'Periodic submission' introduces timing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'DATED' is swapped with 'EFFECTIVE', 'By:' with 'Per:', 'Chief Financial Officer' with 'Head of Finance'. Using 'Effective' implies that the agreement may come into effect on a day that is separate from the 'Dated' on the agreement. It is unclear if the signing date and the effectivity date is the same.",

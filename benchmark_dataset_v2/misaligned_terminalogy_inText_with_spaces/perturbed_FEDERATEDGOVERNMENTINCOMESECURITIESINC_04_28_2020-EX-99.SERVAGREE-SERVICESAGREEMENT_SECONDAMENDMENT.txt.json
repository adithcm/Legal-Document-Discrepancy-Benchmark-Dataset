Later references to \"Second Amendment\" will be unclear, and the role of 'Service Provider' is not as well-defined as FASC which is a defined term, making it unclear who is responsible for which actions.",

It's unclear if 'Contract' refers to the same document as 'Services Agreement', and it makes it unclear which Amendment it refers to. This makes enforcement more difficult.",

Introduces ambiguity about roles and responsibilities. Are these the same functions/entities but with different names, or are they distinct? The original text has better defined roles. This uncertainty makes it difficult to determine liability in case of errors or disputes.",

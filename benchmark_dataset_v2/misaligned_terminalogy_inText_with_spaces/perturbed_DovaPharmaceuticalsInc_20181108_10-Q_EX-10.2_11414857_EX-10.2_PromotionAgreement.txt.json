                "original_text": "1.54 \"Sales Representative\" shall mean an individual employed and compensated by Valeant as a full-time employee as part of its sales forces and who engages in Detailing of the Designated Product (or the Alternate Product, as the case may be) in the Territory, and who is also trained with respect to the Product in accordance with this Agreement (including the Product Labeling and the use of the Promotional Materials) to deliver Details for the Product in the Field in the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "1.54 \"Sales Representative\" shall mean an individual contracted by Valeant to perform detailing of the Designated Product (or the Alternate Product, as the case may be) in the Territory. Such individual is trained with respect to detailing and promotion in accordance with the general policies of Valeant.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Sales Representative' as a full-time employee, while the modified version refers to an individual contracted by Valeant. This creates an internal contradiction regarding the employment status and training requirements of the individual performing Detailing, leading to uncertainty in enforcement regarding benefits, compliance, and responsibilities.",

In addition, Dova shall, and shall require all of its sales representatives to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",

In addition, Dova shall, and shall encourage its marketing agents to consider Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Valeant and its Field Force Personnel to comply 'in all respects with Applicable Laws.' The modified version introduces a contradiction by stating 'comply with the key tenets of company policy' and 'best efforts attempt to follow Applicable Laws', weakening the obligation and creating ambiguity. Dova is weakened to \"encourage its marketing agents to consider Applicable Laws\" instead of a strict requirement. This can cause uncertainty in legal adherence.",

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self- insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated. Each Party shall provide reasonable written proof of the existence of such insurance to the other Party upon request. Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker's compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant's sole responsibility.",

Each Party will attempt to adhere to the insurance guidelines outlined within each of their own internal operating procedures and may, at their discretion, attempt to align insurance coverage with the basic and general levels of other similar entities. Each Party might offer an overview of their insurance practices or policies, if requested.",
                "explanation": "The original text enforces a legal standard of maintaining 'adequate insurance' with required coverages. The altered text changes the wording to a more subjective agreement by using less restrictive and vague terms such as 'reasonable level', 'attempt to adhere', 'may, at their discretion, attempt to align insurance'. The original provides a hard rule with strict legal enforceability, but the modified text introduces vagueness and uncertainties about what 'reasonable', 'internal operating procedures', and 'basic and general levels' actually mean. The change in terms alters the nature of the contract from a strict enforceable agreement to a more ambiguous one",

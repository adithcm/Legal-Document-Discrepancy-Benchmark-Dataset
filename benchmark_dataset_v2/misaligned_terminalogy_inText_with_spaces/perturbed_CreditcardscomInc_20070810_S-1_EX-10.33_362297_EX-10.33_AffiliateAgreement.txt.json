(?Chase?) and you as an \"Affiliate\" in the Chase Affiliate Program (the \"Affiliate Program\"). Once accepted into the Affiliate Program, an Affiliate can establish links from the Affiliate's Website to [Chase.com].

Once accepted into the Affiliate Program, a Vendor can establish links from the Vendor's Website to [Chase.com]. Chase will pay Vendor a fee for each approved credit card account that originates from a link in Vendor's Website.",

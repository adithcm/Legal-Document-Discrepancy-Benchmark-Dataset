It is understood that PAPA JOHN'S shall not use the Celebrity Endorsement for any other purpose or in connection with any other items unless specifically permitted herein.

                "explanation": "In this section, I changed \"Celebrity Endorsement\" to \"Celebrity Affiliation.\" This introduces another term ('Celebrity Affiliation') without defining it, while the rest of the paragraph still refers to the 'Celebrity Endorsement.' This discrepancy creates significant confusion regarding the actual scope of rights granted to Papa John's. Is 'Celebrity Affiliation' equivalent to 'Celebrity Endorsement,' or does it encompass a different set of rights and responsibilities?",

                "explanation": "The section is changed to 'Enforcement of Celebrity Goodwill'. In this section, I replaced the term 'Celebrity Endorsement' with 'Celebrity Goodwill'. While 'goodwill' is a relevant concept in branding, it is not explicitly defined in relation to the 'Personality Rights' as described in the rest of the agreement. This change creates ambiguity. Does ABG have the right to protect all aspects of 'goodwill' associated with the Celebrity, or only the aspects that directly relate to the defined 'Personality Rights'? This is especially pertinent if, as in a previous change, 'Celebrity Endorsement' is linked to the undefined 'Publicity Rights'",

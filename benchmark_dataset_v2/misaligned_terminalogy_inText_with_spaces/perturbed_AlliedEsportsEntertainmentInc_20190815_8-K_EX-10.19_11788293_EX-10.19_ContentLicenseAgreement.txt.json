The Annual Minimum Guarantee shall be recoupable from such Royalties as are, or have become, paid to WPT. For clarification, the Annual Minimum Guarantee will operate as an advance payment, such that when accrued Royalties exceed the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments already paid, then the excess Royalties will be paid by Zynga to WPT.",
                "changed_text": "Annual Minimum Guarantee. Zynga will provide WPT the Annual Minimum Contribution as outlined in the Basic Provisions. The Annual Minimum Contribution may be recoupable from such Royalties as are, or have become, paid to WPT. For clarification, the Annual Minimum Contribution may operate as an advance payment, such that when accrued Royalties exceed the Annual Minimum Contribution payments already paid, then the excess Royalties will be paid by Zynga to WPT.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Annual Minimum Guarantee' is changed to 'Annual Minimum Contribution'. Additionally, the mandatory 'shall pay' is changed to the permissive 'may be recoupable' and 'may operate'. This weakens WPT's entitlement to the guaranteed amount, potentially leading to disputes regarding Zynga's payment obligations.",

An amount due of less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) will be accumulated to the next payment and will be included in the amount to be paid to WPT on the next payment date, again provided that the amount owed to WPT in the subsequent month exceeds five hundred dollars ($500.00). Accumulated amounts do not accrue any interest.",
                "changed_text": "Zynga will remit all amounts accruing under this Agreement for any reporting period to WPT by check or wire transfer to the account specified by WPT in writing, concurrently with Zynga's delivery of the applicable report under Section 3(d), provided that payments are preferred if the amount owed to WPT for any reporting period is greater than five hundred dollars ($500.00). An amount due of less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) might be accumulated to the next payment and might be included in the amount to be paid to WPT on the next payment date, again provided that the amount owed to WPT in the subsequent month exceeds five hundred dollars ($500.00). Accumulated amounts might not accrue any interest.",
                "explanation": "The term 'shall pay' is changed to 'will remit' creating ambiguity by using different terms for the same obligation. 'Payments will only be paid' is changed to 'payments are preferred'. Also, 'will be accumulated' is changed to 'might be accumulated', making the accumulation of payments discretionary and uncertain, potentially harming WPT's cash flow.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'WPT shall indemnify' to 'WPT is responsible to indemnify' weakens the obligation. The phrase 'WPT's non-compliance' has been changed to 'WPT's negligence'. This significantly alters the trigger for indemnification, as negligence requires a specific showing of fault, whereas non-compliance is broader and may include unintentional breaches. This shift introduces uncertainty in the scope of indemnification.",

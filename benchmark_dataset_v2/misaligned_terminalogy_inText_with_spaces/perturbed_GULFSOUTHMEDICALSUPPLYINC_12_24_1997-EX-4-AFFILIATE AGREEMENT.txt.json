                "explanation": "Changing 'Merger' to 'Acquisition' and 'Merger Corp.' to 'Acquisition Corp.' creates inconsistency in the document. The terms are used interchangeably without clear definition. This could lead to disputes as to which specific legal process and obligations are applicable. By changing the name of the transaction, this creates an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'affiliate' to 'associate' but keeping 'affiliate' later in the sentence leads to ambiguity. It is unclear if an 'associate' has the same obligations as an 'affiliate' under the agreement. The initial definition references affiliate status, but the new term 'associate' is introduced, creating a contradiction about the applicable legal status.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Restrictions on Transfer' to 'Limitations on Transfer', and then using the word merger and acquisition, creates inconsistency in the document, and ambiguity on whether 'limitations' carries the same weight as 'restrictions.' By doing so, we are implying there are differences when there is none and it can create an internal contradiction.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Consultant agrees to act as a consultant to Company with respect to such matters and projects as are mutually agreed from time to time by and between Consultant and Company, and perform the services described on Exhibit A hereto (collectively, \"Services\"). Company agrees to pay Consultant the compensation set forth on Exhibit A hereto for the performance of the Services.",

Company agrees to pay Consultant the compensation set forth on Exhibit A hereto for the performance of the Services.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'consultant' and 'contractor' are used interchangeably in the first sentence. While in some contexts they may be similar, legal interpretations can differ, particularly regarding liability and intellectual property. This creates ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall cease except: Company shall be obliged to pay, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Consultant's final statement, all amounts owing to Consultant for unpaid Services completed by Consultant and related expenses, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall cease except: Company will endeavor to pay, within sixty (60) days after receipt of Contractor's final invoice, all amounts possibly owing to Contractor for unbilled activities completed by Contractor and associated costs, if any, in accordance with the stipulations of Section 1 hereof, and Sections 2, 3, S(c), 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Consultant' to 'Contractor,' 'statement' to 'invoice,' 'Services' to 'activities,' 'obliged' to 'endeavor,' 'thirty (30)' to 'sixty (60),' and 'owing' to 'possibly owing' introduce inconsistencies in terminology and payment obligations. The original text states a clear obligation to pay within 30 days, while the altered text uses weaker language ('endeavor to pay,' 'possibly owing') and extends the payment timeframe, creating uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "Consultant will render to Company the following Services: • Provide business and statistical analysis of company metrics • Provide leadership role for business development strategies • Manage all in house consulting duties to maximize return for company objectives • Manage key marketing and communication campaigns • Prioritize and support clinical product pipeline business priorities • Work closely with executive team to ensure department initiatives are all aligned • Locate, evaluate and develop new business contacts and opportunities",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Consultant' to 'Contractor' is inconsistent with earlier sections. Also, changing 'Services' to 'tasks' and using other different verbs and nouns (e.g., 'leadership role' to 'guidance role,' 'duties' to 'operational duties,' 'return' to 'profit,' 'campaigns' to 'plans,' 'business priorities' to 'commercial goals,' 'Work closely' to 'Liaise,' 'all aligned' to 'generally aligned,' 'business contacts' to 'business leads') subtly alters the nature of the obligations and expectations. This makes it difficult to determine the precise scope of work.",

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, the City of Fort Stockton, Texas (\"COFS\") owns the surface and groundwater rights to several areas of the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation; and\n\nWHEREAS, COFS has an existing Capitan Reef Aquifer (\"CRA\") water well located at Section 112 on COFS property, which is currently drilled to an approximate depth of 3,500 feet (the \"Existing CRA Well\"), and also owns property at Section 71; and\n\nWHEREAS, STW desires to attempt to deepen the Existing CRA Well in order to make it a producing water well and/or drill an alternate well(s) at its own expense, and to lease CRA groundwater rights from Sections 112 and 71 of COFS property; and   WHEREAS, STW and COFS desire to work together for the development of a CRA water supply project within the area that will serve to meet the future needs of COFS and the municipal and industrial needs within the region.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'owns' changed to 'possesses', 'water well' changed to 'water borehole', 'producing water well' changed to 'producing water source', and 'alternate well' changed to 'alternative borehole'. These substitutions create uncertainty as to whether these terms are legally synonymous. This could affect the interpretation of COFS's rights and STW's obligations.",

COFS hereby grants, leases and lets unto STW the right to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\"). STW is further authorized to drill, deepen, and/or rework at its expense the Existing CRA Well on Section 112 of the Property from its current depth of approximately 3,500 feet to approximately 4,000 feet, so as to determine the following to be verified by a study to be performed by a hydrogeologist mutually agreed upon by both Parties (\"Post-Well Study\"): (a) the gallons per day (\"GPD\") of maximum water capacity of the Existing CRA Well or alternate well, as may be required under Section 5 of the AGREEMENT; and (b) the quality of the water to be obtained from the Existing CRA Well or alternate well. The rights granted to STW under this AGREEMENT also include the right of access to the Property to perform the activities authorized herein.   2.  Acces s and Surface Use. STW agrees to coordinate reasonably with COFS with respect to location of any new wells, roadways, power infrastructure, and other improvements that are to be constructed or used on the Property. COFS shall provide STW rent free site leases for the commercially reasonable amounts of surface area required for CRA pumping and filling stations located on the Property. STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property. Upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to the Property only, STW, or its successors or assigns, shall transfer title of all water conveyance pipelines from the Property to COFS. STW shall administer and provide all necessary and reasonable insurance to insure its activities on the Property in relation to the AGREEMENT and shall list COFS as additional insured.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Water Well' is changed to 'Water Source', 'alternate well' is changed to 'secondary source', and 'new wells' is changed to 'new pumping locations'. The change introduces ambiguity as to whether the responsibilities and rights pertain to both, or only one of them. For example, it becomes unclear if STW is authorized to drill, deepen, and/or rework a 'secondary source', or the obligations to coordinate and provide site leases for 'pumping locations' applies to both 'wells' and 'sources'.",

This may create ambiguity as to the conditions under which payments are triggered. It is now unclear whether 'earnings' only include certain streams, or if they have the same accounting requirements. The modifications introduce ambiguity as to if those terms have the same meaning, and this could lead to disputes over the calculation of royalties.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor will comply with all country, federal, state and local laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, policies and procedures, Including, without limitation, all anti-corruption laws, Including, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (Applicable Laws). Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, o r  b y contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will comply with all company policies and procedures. Distributor can find more information about these policies by contacting Cisco directly.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement for the distributor to comply with all applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This omission could create a legal loophole, as the distributor may argue that their obligation is limited to Cisco's internal policies, even if those policies are not fully compliant with the law.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws.",

                "changed_text": "(e) Distributor's key personnel who directly support Cisco's account may complete training on compliance with applicable laws.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'have or will have completed training' to 'may complete training,' the contract removes the mandatory training requirement. This weakens the due diligence expected of the distributor under anti-corruption laws. Making the training optional instead of mandatory reduces the distributor's accountability for compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws, which emphasize due diligence and training.",

                "changed_text": "(n) Cisco may terminate this Agreement with thirty days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change removes Cisco's explicit right to immediately terminate the agreement if the distributor breaches the representations and warranties related to compliance with laws. This is a legally required consumer right, because is important to preserve consumer safety, reduces legal risk, makes the contract non-compliant, and removes an important compliance measure. This weakens Cisco's ability to enforce compliance and potentially exposes them to liability if the distributor violates anti-corruption laws.",

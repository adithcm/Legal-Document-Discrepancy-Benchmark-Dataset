                "explanation": "The removal of 'is in compliance' with 'may not be in compliance' weakens the assurance that MetLife and its subsidiaries adhere to legal and regulatory requirements. This introduces legal risk, as it fails to affirm compliance with laws essential for consumer protection and financial stability, particularly in heavily regulated sectors like insurance. This creates legal risk and reduces consumer protection, especially concerning regulatory compliance and financial stability.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the explicit requirement for Insurance Subsidiaries to comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations, replacing it with adherence to \"its own internal policies\". This creates a legal contradiction with insurance regulations that mandate compliance with external legal standards, undermining consumer protection by potentially allowing practices non-compliant with state and federal laws.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'reasonable assurance' to 'some assurance,' the modified text reduces the standard for the reliability of financial reporting. The change introduces legal risk by suggesting that internal controls may not fully meet the regulatory expectations under the Exchange Act for ensuring accurate and reliable financial statements, thus potentially misleading investors and regulatory bodies.",

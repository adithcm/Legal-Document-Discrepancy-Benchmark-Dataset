                "original_text": "This Amendment (the \"Amendment\") is entered into this 15th day of July 1998, by and between INGRAM MICRO INC. (\"Ingram\") and NETGEAR, INC. (\"Vendor\").\n\nThe parties have agreed to amend their Distribution Agreement (\"Agreement\") dated October 1,1996.",
                "changed_text": "This Amendment (the \"Amendment\") is entered into this 15th day of July 1998, by and between INGRAM MICRO INC. (\"Ingram\") and NETGEAR, INC. (\"Vendor\").",
                "explanation": "Removing the statement that 'The parties have agreed to amend their Distribution Agreement' could be interpreted as a lack of mutual agreement, potentially voiding modifications or creating ambiguity, which can be used to waive consumer rights in future disputes, especially considering CA law requires clear and mutual assent for contract modifications.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Amendment shall remain in effect at NETGEAR's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing the term duration to 'NETGEAR's discretion' removes the distributor's right to a defined contract period, conflicting with general contract law principles which require a reasonable or specified duration, allowing NETGEAR to potentially terminate the agreement prematurely without cause. This affects consumer rights downstream as it relates to product availability and warranty support.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned has read this Amendment and is an authorized representative of its respective party.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'all other provisions of the Agreement remain unchanged' creates uncertainty about the original agreement's terms and conditions, indirectly affecting consumer rights such as warranty claims, return policies, or liability limitations. By omitting this clause, the new agreement could be interpreted as superseding earlier consumer protections, conflicting with contract law principles that necessitate clarity and full disclosure of terms.",

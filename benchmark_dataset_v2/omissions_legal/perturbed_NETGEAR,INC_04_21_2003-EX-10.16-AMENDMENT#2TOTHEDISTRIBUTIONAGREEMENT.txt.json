                "explanation": "The removal of 'subject to Distributor conducting mutually agreed to marketing activities as described in the Marketing Plan for [*] to be developed and agreed to by and between the parties and which shall be attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 4a' weakens the distributor's exclusive appointment. This introduces legal risk because it removes a condition that protects the distributor's interests, potentially violating state laws regarding fair dealing and good faith in contractual relationships within the United States (default jurisdiction since specific jurisdiction is not provided).",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, all other provisions of the Agreement remain unchanged.', this creates ambiguity about the remaining terms of the original agreement. If essential consumer rights clauses existed in the original agreement (e.g., warranty, return policies), the omission introduces a legal contradiction as it's unclear if those consumer protection clauses still apply. This violates consumer protection laws.",

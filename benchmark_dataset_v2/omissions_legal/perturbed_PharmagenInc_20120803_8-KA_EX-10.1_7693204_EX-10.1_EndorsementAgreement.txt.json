                "explanation": "This change removes the specific insurance coverage requirements and limits, and provides the certificate of insurance at HDS's discretion. This contradicts standard business practices and potentially Georgia law, which often requires specific insurance coverage for businesses based on their operations and product liability risks to protect the celebrity from liability. The original text mentions \"Commercial General Liability coverage of product liability with limits no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate.\", \"Umbrella / Excess Liability coverage inclusive of product liability with limits not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate.\" and  \"Media Liability insurance with limits not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate.\". Removing those sentences creates a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the celebrity's right to approve the use of their attributes in advertising materials, placing full control with HDS. Many states have laws protecting an individual's right of publicity, meaning their likeness cannot be used for commercial purposes without their consent. Omitting the approval process potentially violates these rights and creates legal risk for unauthorized use of Celebrity's image.",

This provides more guarantee and protection to the celebrity and consumer. This change removes the commitment to adhere to all applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, especially those relating to product safety. This creates a legal risk, particularly if the product fails to meet specific state requirements, such as labeling laws, ingredient restrictions, or safety standards.

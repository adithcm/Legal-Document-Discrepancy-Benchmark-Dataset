JOINT VENTURE COMPANY'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO THE LOOP PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO A TRANSFERRED CONTRACT, IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF RECOVERY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL, DIRECT, AND DOCUMENTED DAMAGES THE APPLICABLE AUTHORIZED CUSTOMER ACTUALLY RECOVERS FROM THE LOOP PARTIES UNDER THE TRANSFERRED CONTRACT BASED SOLELY ON JOINT VENTURE COMPANY'S BREACH OF SUCH TRANSFERRED CONTRACT. JOINT VENTURE COMPANY SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOOP PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ELIGIBLE CONTRACT THAT DOES NOT BECOME A TRANSFERRED CONTRACT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 2.3. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3.1 SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO EITHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF SECTION 4, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR FOR CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT THEY ARISE OUT OF A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'OR FOR CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT THEY ARISE OUT OF A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT' eliminates the exception for gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct from the limitation of liability. This is a legally required consumer protection because, under Delaware law, parties cannot contractually limit liability for their own gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. Such a limitation is against public policy.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'OR STATUTORY' from the disclaimer of representations and warranties, the agreement attempts to disclaim statutory warranties that may be implied by law (e.g., warranty of merchantability, warranty of fitness for a particular purpose). Delaware law and the UCC generally allow for disclaimer of implied warranties if done conspicuously, but disclaiming ALL statutory warranties could be interpreted to violate consumer protection laws that mandate certain minimum standards or implied warranties for goods sold.",

                "explanation": "The phrase “United States of America” is removed to open up ambiguity. While it seems minor, consumer contracts often must explicitly state the governing jurisdiction for clarity and to ensure consumers know their rights and where disputes will be resolved. The legal risk this opens up for this contract is related to conflicts of laws between US federal regulations and state laws. Removing “United States of America” may cause the contract to obscure this important issue.",

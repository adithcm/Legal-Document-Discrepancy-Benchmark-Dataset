                "original_text": "The Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) shall not be liable to the Fund for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Blockchain Administrator in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as blockchain administrator of the Fund, and the Fund shall indemnify, defend and protect the Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Fund or its security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as administrator of the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 5 to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall protect or be deemed to protect the Indemnified Parties against or entitle or be deemed to entitle the Indemnified Parties to indemnification in respect of, any liability to the Fund or its security holders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Blockchain Administrator's duties and obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall indemnify, defend and protect' to 'may indemnify, defend, and protect' makes indemnification discretionary and removing the phrase 'including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement' weakens indemnification coverage. Finally, removing the second half of the section eliminates the stipulation of 'criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence', thereby entitling indemnification even in the face of gross misconduct and violating fiduciary duty requirements under Delaware trust law.",

In such case, to the extent the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any of the provisions herein, conflict with the provisions of the Investment Fund Act, the latter shall control,' the contract now prioritizes New York law over the Investment Company Act of 1940.

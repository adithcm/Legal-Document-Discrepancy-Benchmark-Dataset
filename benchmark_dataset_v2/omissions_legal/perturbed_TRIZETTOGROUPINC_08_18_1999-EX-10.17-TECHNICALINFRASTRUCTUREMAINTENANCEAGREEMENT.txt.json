                "original_text": "MMMW warrants that the Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition provided it is:\n\n               1) continuously subject to MMMW's inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service; and\n\n               2) subject to normal use and conditions. MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",

MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for continuous inspection and acceptance by MMMW significantly weakens the warranty's enforceability. It eliminates a key condition precedent for the warranty to apply, potentially leaving the customer without recourse for hardware failures, especially since Indiana law implies a warranty of merchantability. This clause makes it easier for MMMW to deny warranty claims by arguing that the hardware was not continuously inspected and accepted.",

                "explanation": "Removing the acknowledgment of potentially conflicting state laws and replacing it with a statement asserting Indiana law exclusively directly contradicts consumer protection laws in states with stronger warranty or liability rights. This attempts to bypass mandatory minimum standards for consumer protection and creates legal risk.",

                "explanation": "Removing the guaranteed response time and on-site availability after hours significantly weakens the service commitment. It eliminates a concrete promise to the customer, making it harder to hold MMMW accountable for slow response times. The removal of guaranteed response times directly affects the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is present in contract law and implies reasonable response times to technical failures.",

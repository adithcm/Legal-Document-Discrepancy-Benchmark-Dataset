                "changed_text": "This Amendment in all respects, and any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this Amendment, or any dealing between the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company/Repairer relationship being established, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of a jurisdiction chosen at the Repairer's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to New York General Obligations Law and specifying that the governing law is chosen at the Repairer's discretion, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential violation of consumer protection laws that might otherwise apply under New York law. This allows the Repairer to select a jurisdiction with weaker consumer protections, thereby creating legal risk for Azul.",

                "explanation": "By allowing the Repairer to choose the arbitration location and the arbitrator to choose the language, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential hardship for Azul. Arbitrating in a distant location or in a language Azul is not fluent in could significantly disadvantage them, potentially violating principles of fair arbitration and access to justice, implicitly contradicting laws ensuring equitable dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "By giving the Repairer sole discretion over confidentiality, the contract allows them to potentially disclose sensitive information about Azul, which could violate commercial confidentiality laws and create a significant imbalance of power. This is particularly problematic if the Repairer uses this information to harm Azul's business interests, thus creating a legal risk.",

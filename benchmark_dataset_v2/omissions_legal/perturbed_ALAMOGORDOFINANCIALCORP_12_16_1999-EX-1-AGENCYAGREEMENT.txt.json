                "changed_text": "The deposit accounts of the Bank may be insured; and no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such insurance are pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company or the Bank, threatened.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guarantee that deposit accounts are insured up to the legal limit. By stating accounts 'may be insured', it contradicts the FDIC's legal mandate to insure deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, thereby creating legal risk. The FDIC insurance is a consumer protection required by federal law.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the requirement that annual reports be certified by independent public accountants in accordance with Regulation S-X. This regulation mandates specific accounting standards and independent audits to ensure financial transparency and protect investors. Removing this requirement weakens investor protections and potentially violates securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the consumer protection requirement that funds received from subscriptions be deposited on an interest-bearing basis at the rate described in the prospectus. It also eliminates the specific requirement to maintain records that allow each subscriber's funds to be separately insured by the FDIC up to the maximum extent allowable. By deleting these requirements the contract contradicts consumer protection laws.",

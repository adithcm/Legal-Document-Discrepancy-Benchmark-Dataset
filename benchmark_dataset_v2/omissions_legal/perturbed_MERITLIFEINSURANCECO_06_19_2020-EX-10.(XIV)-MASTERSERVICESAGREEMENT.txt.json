                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Contractor shall maintain workers compensation insurance in the amount required by statute, comprehensive general liability insurance with coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) and professional errors and omissions insurance for bodily injury, property damage or other losses with coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000), in connection with the provision of Services by Contractor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. At Company's request, Contractor shall provide Company with certificates or other acceptable evidence of insurance or self-insurance evidencing the above coverage and shall provide Company with prompt written notice of any material change.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Contractor shall maintain general liability insurance in connection with the provision of Services by Contractor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Evidence of insurance may be requested by Company.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'workers compensation insurance in the amount required by statute,' and specific coverage amounts for general liability and professional errors and omissions insurance eliminates mandatory insurance coverage that would normally be legally required to protect employees and the company from damages from contracted work in Arizona. It also removes the requirement to provide 'prompt written notice of any material change.' Arizona law mandates worker's compensation coverage and minimum liability coverage for businesses, including contractors.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of contract.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specific jurisdiction of Arizona, the contract becomes vague and potentially unenforceable regarding applicable state laws. Arizona has specific consumer protection laws and business regulations that would apply to this agreement if the jurisdiction were specified. By removing Arizona, it could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent these state-specific consumer and business protections, creating a legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'common law, statutory law or in equity' and specifying the arbitration rules of 'U.S. Arbitration & Mediation, (www.usam.com)' the agreement removes important clarification about the scope of disputes covered by arbitration and the standards that should be followed. Removing 'which includes within the federal judicial district of the residence of the party against whom such award or order was entered' removes important clarification about which courts would have jurisdiction, potentially making it difficult for consumers to challenge the arbitration decision. In Arizona, arbitration agreements must clearly define the scope and rules of arbitration and allow access to courts of competent jurisdiction to ensure fairness and protect consumer rights.",

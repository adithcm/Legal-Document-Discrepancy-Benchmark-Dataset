                "changed_text": "The Parties agree that their respective marketing and advertising efforts will not contain any material which is obscene or threatening.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement to comply with 'all applicable laws, rules and regulations' and removes protections against 'fraudulent, harassing, libelous, infringing of third party intellectual property rights, otherwise illegal or, in the reasonable judgment of the Party required to display or transmit the advertisement, offensive' material. This could violate consumer protection laws regarding false advertising and intellectual property rights.",

In addition, HDI, in performing the Services for the Company hereunder, may have access to or be exposed to, directly or indirectly, Content, user information, data, knowledge and proprietary and trade secret information of the Company in oral, graphic, written, electronic or machine readable form (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Confidential Information\"). Confidential Information shall not include information which can be demonstrated: (a) to have been rightfully in the possession of HDI from a source other than the Company prior to the time of disclosure of said information to HDI hereunder (\"Time of Receipt\"); (b) to have been in the public domain prior to the Time of Receipt; (c) to have become part of the public domain after the Time of Receipt by a publication or by any other means except an unauthorized act or omission or breach of this Agreement on the part of HDI, its employees, or agents; or (d) to have been supplied to HDI after the Time of Receipt by a third party who is under no obligation to the -8- Company to maintain such information in confidence.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the confidentiality obligations. It removes the requirement to maintain 'strict' confidentiality and narrows the scope of 'Confidential Information' by omitting 'terms and conditions of this Agreement', 'user information', 'knowledge and proprietary and trade secret information of the Company in oral, graphic, written, electronic or machine readable form'. Also, the specific conditions for excluding the confidential information have also been omitted. This potentially violates consumer data protection laws depending on the nature of the user information collected and how it is handled.",

                "explanation": "This change removes critical warranties. Omitting 'validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation' weakens the assurance of the entity's legal status. Removing (3) and (4) eliminates guarantees that the agreement is binding and doesn't conflict with prior obligations. This can create legal risk, especially if a party is not actually authorized to enter the agreement or if existing obligations are violated.",

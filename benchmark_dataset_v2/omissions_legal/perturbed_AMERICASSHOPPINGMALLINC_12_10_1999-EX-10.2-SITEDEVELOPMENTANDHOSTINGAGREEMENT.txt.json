                "original_text": "The Parties hereby covenant and agree that their respective marketing and advertising efforts provided for herein shall at all times comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations and will not contain any material which is obscene, threatening, fraudulent, harassing, libelous, infringing of third party intellectual property rights, otherwise illegal or, in the reasonable judgment of the Party required to display or transmit the advertisement, offensive.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'shall at all times comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations' from the clause, the contract creates a legal risk. This introduces ambiguity as to whether the marketing and advertising efforts are bound by consumer protection laws, such as those prohibiting deceptive advertising which is a clear violation of consumer law.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with laws applicable to contracts made and to be performed.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of New York State law, and removing 'exclusively in that State without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws' the applicable law becomes vague. The change exposes consumers to legal risks, as it allows the company to potentially argue for a different jurisdiction's laws to apply, possibly circumventing consumer protection laws that would be enforced under New York law. This is a legal contradiction because the original clause provides legal certainty of protection and removing it, it no longer complies.",

                "explanation": "The removal of critical qualifying phrases such as 'Time of Receipt' in (a) and (b), 'except an unauthorized act or omission or breach of this Agreement on the part of HDI, its employees, or agents' in (c), and 'who is under no obligation to the Company to maintain such information in confidence' in (d) weakens the definition of confidential information. Specifically, the Time of Receipt and other qualifiers protect confidential information but not specifying a time that is a loophole so there is a violation.",

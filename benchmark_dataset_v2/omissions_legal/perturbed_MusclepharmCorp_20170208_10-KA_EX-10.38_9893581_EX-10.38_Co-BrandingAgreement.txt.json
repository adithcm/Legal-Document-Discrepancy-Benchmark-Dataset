                "original_text": "MusclePharm shall, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for a period of not less than four years thereafter, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense from a qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York, a commercial general liability insurance policy including coverage for contractual liability (applying to the terms and conditions of this agreement), product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in a form approved by the AS Parties, in the amount of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence naming the AS Parties (for the avoidance of doubt, specifically including each of Lender, Endorser, and Fitness) as additional named insureds. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such policy shall provide protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any defects or failure to perform, alleged or otherwise, of the Products and Licensed Products or any material used in connection therewith or any use thereof. The policy shall provide for ten (10) days notice to the AS Parties from the insurer by Registered or Certified Mail, return receipt requested, in the event of any modification, cancellation, or termination thereof. MusclePharm agrees to furnish the AS Parties a certificate of insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement and, in no event, shall MusclePharm manufacture, distribute, advertise, or sell the Licensed Products prior to receipt by the AS Parties of such evidence of insurance. MusclePharm shall be responsible to provide for any appearances pursuant to this Agreement by Endorser appropriate certificates of insurance with coverage limits of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence endorsed to name the AS Parties as additional named insureds with respect to claims arising out of appearances by Endorser. MusclePharm shall be responsible to pay the deductible under any such insurance policies with respect to any claims made under such policies.",

                "explanation": "The removal of specific coverage types (contractual liability, product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability) and the minimum coverage amount ($5,000,000 per occurrence), weakens the insurance requirements. The deletion of the 'qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York' further weakens the clause. This creates a legal contradiction with California law (given Section 21's governing law clause) that mandates specific minimum coverage amounts and types of liability coverage for businesses operating within the state, especially those dealing with products that could cause harm.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'at their own cost and expense and in their sole discretion' for both parties creates ambiguity and potential legal issues. California law generally dictates that the prevailing party in intellectual property infringement cases may recover attorneys' fees and costs. This omission could be interpreted as an attempt to waive these rights, or create uncertainty about who is responsible for costs, conflicting with established legal standards. Moreover, removing 'deem proper or necessary in their sole discretion for the protection and preservation of such rights' limit the range of options and can make the contract non-compliant with California law that protects IP rights.",

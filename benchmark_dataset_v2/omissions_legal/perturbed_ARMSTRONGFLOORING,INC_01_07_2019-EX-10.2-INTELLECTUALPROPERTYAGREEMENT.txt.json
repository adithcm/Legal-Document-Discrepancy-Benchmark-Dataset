The Buyer Entities acknowledge the importance of Arizona's exercise of quality control over the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks to preserve the continued integrity and validity of the Seller Licensed Trademarks and to protect the value and goodwill associated with the Seller Licensed Trademarks, and accordingly: (a) The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller's right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks. (b) The Company shall not tarnish or bring into disrepute the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Seller Licensed Trademarks or Arizona. (c) The Company shall use the Seller Licensed Trademarks at all times in compliance with all applicable Laws.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandated goods and services to be 'substantially the same as or greater than' the prior quality, removed that ensuring a higher standard. The phrase 'reasonably likely' has been removed, watering down the protection. The clause 'as reasonably requested by Arizona from time to time' has been replaced by the abridged version. The term 'representative' has been dropped from the samples clause. These omissions collectively reduce the legal obligation on the Company to maintain quality control, potentially violating consumer protection laws that require consistent quality and prevent misleading representation of branded goods.",

In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 45-day notification period before the Company or Buyer can act against infringers of Arizona Licensed Patents weakens the Company's ability to protect its interests in the Company Field, as Arizona could delay notification indefinitely. Deleting 'Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer,' significantly reduces the extent of Arizona's commitment to cooperate, which could be crucial in complex IP litigation. Removing the specific clause about Arizona assisting the Company in seeking cooperation from the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement weakens the enforcement mechanism. These changes, by diminishing the Company's enforcement rights and reducing Arizona's cooperation obligations, introduce legal risk concerning the effective protection of licensed intellectual property.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clauses that explicitly define the specific courts (Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, etc.) and replacing them with a general reference to 'courts in Delaware' creates ambiguity and could lead to disputes over jurisdiction and venue, potentially increasing litigation costs. Removing the detailed acknowledgement that each party understands and voluntarily agrees to the jury trial waiver, and that they have been induced to enter into the agreement by such waivers, eliminates key protections that ensure the waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. This weakens the enforceability of the jury trial waiver. The absence of these explicit acknowledgements increases the risk that a party could later challenge the waiver, arguing they did not fully understand its implications, potentially leading to a violation of due process rights.",

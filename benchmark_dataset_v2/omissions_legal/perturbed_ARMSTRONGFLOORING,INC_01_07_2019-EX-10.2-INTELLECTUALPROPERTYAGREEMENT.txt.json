(b) The Company shall not tarnish or bring into disrepute the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Seller Licensed Trademarks or Arizona. (c) The Company shall use the Seller Licensed Trademarks at all times in compliance with all applicable Laws. (d) The Company shall include trademark and other notices in connection with the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks as reasonably requested by Arizona from time to time. (e) The Company shall upon Arizona's reasonable request from time to time, supply to Arizona representative samples and/or written descriptions, as appropriate, of uses made by the Company of the Seller Licensed Trademarks. (f) The Buyer Entities acknowledge that this license grant does not include, and the Company shall receive no rights under this Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement, to use any Trademark that is confusingly similar to or derivative of a Seller Licensed Trademark (other than the Seller Licensed Trademarks themselves as expressly authorized hereunder).",

                "explanation": "This omission removes the clause that requires the company to maintain the quality of goods and services associated with the licensed trademarks. This introduces legal risk because trademark law requires licensors to maintain control over the quality of goods and services sold under their trademarks to avoid abandonment or genericide of the trademark. By removing this quality control clause, the contract fails to ensure that Arizona (the licensor) maintains sufficient control, creating a legal contradiction and potential risk of trademark invalidation. Without the licensee contractually bound to maintaining quality standards, the licensor's ability to demonstrate sufficient quality control is severely compromised.",

                "explanation": "This omission removes the Company's obligation to report complaints related to the trademarks and adhere to quality control and standards as per the Trademark License Agreement. This is a legal contradiction because, under US trademark law, a licensor must maintain control over the quality of goods and services sold under its trademarks. By eliminating the requirement for the Company (licensee) to report complaints and maintain quality standards, the contract fails to ensure that Arizona (licensor) maintains sufficient control, which can lead to the trademark being deemed abandoned or invalidated.",

Arizona, on the one hand, and Buyer Entities, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific 12 performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This omission removes the clause explicitly waiving the requirement for posting a bond or other security when seeking equitable relief (injunctions, specific performance). While parties can often agree to waive certain procedural requirements, some states or jurisdictions might have laws or precedents that require a bond, particularly in preliminary injunctions. Removing the waiver introduces uncertainty and potential legal challenges regarding the availability and conditions for equitable relief. This is a legal contradiction because in certain jurisdictions, the right to seek a bond may be considered a consumer protection to prevent abuse of injunctive relief.",

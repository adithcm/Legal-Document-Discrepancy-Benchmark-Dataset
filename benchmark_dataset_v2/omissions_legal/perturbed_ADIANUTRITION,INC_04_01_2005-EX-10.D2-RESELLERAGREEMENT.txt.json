                "original_text": "Detto shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Detto's marketing and distribution of Qwik-Fix Pro hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Detto shall, at its own expense, make, obtain, and maintain in force at all times during the term of this Agreement, all filings, registrations, licenses, permits and authorizations in North America required for Detto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Detto shall make reasonable efforts to comply with laws and regulations applicable to Detto's marketing and distribution of Qwik-Fix Pro hereunder. Detto shall make reasonable efforts to maintain filings, registrations, licenses, permits and authorizations in North America required for Detto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with all applicable laws. By changing 'shall comply' to 'shall make reasonable efforts to comply,' the contract weakens Detto's obligation to adhere to legal requirements. This creates a potential loophole where Detto could argue that it made efforts but failed to fully comply, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to marketing and distribution in North America. The phrase 'at its own expense' is also removed, potentially shifting financial burdens related to legal compliance.",

To the extent that Detto fails to fulfill its contractual and legal obligations to its customers, Detto agrees that PivX may elect to fulfill those obligations, or any portion of them, and Detto shall reimburse PivX any costs and expenses so incurred by PivX.

                "explanation": "Removing 'first quality', 'promptly, courteously and appropriately', and 'in a professional manner that shall add to the good reputation of Detto and PivX' weakens the standard of customer service Detto is obligated to provide. Also, removing 'legal' weakens the obligation. This could violate implied warranty laws that require a certain level of service and support. Removing these qualifiers introduces ambiguity and lowers consumer protection standards.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'PivX warrants that Qwik-Fix Pro will substantially conform to the user documentation' and 'INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE' entirely eliminates the already-limited product warranty. This violates consumer protection laws which often imply a warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, ensuring the product functions as intended and is suitable for its marketed use.

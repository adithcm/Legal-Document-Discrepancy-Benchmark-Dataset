E.piphany warrants that for a period of one (1) year from Effective Date, the Application as used within the scope of this Agreement will perform substantially in accordance with the functions described in the Documentation. E.piphany warrants the Application media is free from material defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for ninety (90) days from the applicable Order Form. E.piphany further warrants that its Maintenance, training and Professional Services will be rendered consistent with generally accepted industry standards for a period of ninety (90) days from performance of such services.",

                "explanation": "By removing all express warranties, including the warranty of conforming to the documentation and the warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, the contract violates California's implied warranty laws. California law implies a warranty of merchantability, meaning the product should be fit for its ordinary purpose, which this contract now disclaims.",

While the original clause acknowledged this limit, the modified clause sets a specific interest rate (5% per month = 60% per year) without regard to California usury laws, potentially violating them if the debt falls under the scope of those laws.",

E.piphany will defend or, at its option, settle a claim brought against HSNS that the Application, as used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes a U.S. copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret, and indemnify HSNS against all damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be assessed in any such claim, provided that: (i) HSNS notifies E.piphany in writing within thirty (30) days of the claim; (ii) E.piphany has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (iii) HSNS provides E.piphany with reasonable assistance, information and authority necessary to perform E.piphany's obligations under this Section. E.piphany will reimburse HSNS's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. E.piphany shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on use of a superseded or altered release of the Application if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Application which E.piphany provides to HSNS without charge, or any combination of the Application with materials not provided or recommended by E.piphany. If the Application is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or believed by E.piphany to infringe, E.piphany shall have the option, at its expense, to (i) modify the Application&sbsp;to be non-infringing; or (ii) obtain for HSNS a license to continue using the Application. If E.piphany determines that it is not commercially reasonable to perform either of the above options, then E.piphany may terminate the license for such Application and refund the license fees paid for the Application, prorated as depreciated over five (5) years on a straight-line basis from the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 E.PIPHANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNITY. E.piphany's liability for any claim of intellectual property infringement related to the Application is limited to the amount of license fees paid by HSNS for the Application.",
                "explanation": "This modification eliminates E.piphany's obligation to defend and indemnify HSNS against intellectual property infringement claims and caps the liability to the amount of license fees paid. While parties can contractually limit liability, complete elimination of indemnity for IP infringement can be problematic, especially if E.piphany knows or has reason to know of the infringement. Depending on the specific facts, this could be considered an unconscionable clause or violate public policy concerns related to protecting intellectual property rights, which are relevant under California law.",

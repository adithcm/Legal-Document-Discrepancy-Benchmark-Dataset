                "original_text": "Claims Procedures. If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed with the Plan Administrator or its designee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing and shall be delivered to all parties in interest in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 8 hereof. Such decision shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within ninety (90) days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claim for benefits. If the Plan Administrator fails to notify the claimant of its decision regarding the claim, the claim shall be considered denied, and the claimant then shall be permitted to proceed with an appeal as provided for in this Section 14.\n\nA claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based.\n\nFollowing the review of any additional information submitted by the claimant, either through the hearing process or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request for review (or within 120 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). The Plan Administrator shall deliver the decision to the claimant in writing. If an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. If the decision on review is not furnished within the prescribed time, the claim shall be deemed denied on review.",

If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed with the Plan Administrator or its designee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. The Plan Administrator will make reasonable efforts to address claims in a timely manner. The claimant may appeal the denial of their claim by submitting a written request to the Plan Administrator.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific procedures and timelines for claim denial and appeals, the contract violates ERISA requirements for fair claims processing. The original text provided specific deadlines for the Plan Administrator to respond to claims and appeals, and mandated a full and fair review process. Removing these details makes the claims procedure vague and non-compliant with ERISA regulations, which mandate specific procedures to protect participants' rights to benefits. This modification omits crucial consumer protections mandated by ERISA.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for the Trust's consent for amendments that adversely affect their rights violates the principle of contractual fairness and potentially conflicts with fiduciary duties under ERISA if the Trust is acting on behalf of beneficiaries. By removing the need for the Trust's consent, the company can unilaterally alter the agreement to the detriment of the beneficiaries, a legal risk if the agreement is subject to ERISA standards of fiduciary responsibility.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Plan Administrator or any such employee\" from the indemnification clause creates a potential violation of ERISA's fiduciary responsibility provisions. Under ERISA, fiduciaries cannot be exculpated from liability for breaches of their fiduciary duties. By offering complete indemnification even in cases of negligence or misconduct, the agreement attempts to waive liability in a way that may be unenforceable under ERISA and could expose the company to legal challenges.",

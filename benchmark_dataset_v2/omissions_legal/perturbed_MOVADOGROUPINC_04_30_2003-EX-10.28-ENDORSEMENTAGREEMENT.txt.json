If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed with the Plan Administrator or its designee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing and shall be delivered to all parties in interest in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 8 hereof. Such decision shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within ninety (90) days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claim for benefits. If the Plan Administrator fails to notify the claimant of its decision regarding the claim, the claim shall be considered denied, and the claimant then shall be permitted to proceed with an appeal as provided for in this Section 14. A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based. Following the review of any additional information submitted by the claimant, either through the hearing process or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request for review (or within 120 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). The Plan Administrator shall deliver the decision to the claimant in writing. If an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. If the decision on review is not furnished within the prescribed time, the claim shall be deemed denied on review.",

The modified text removes the mandatory nature of these procedures, replacing them with weaker obligations to make 'reasonable efforts'. Specifically, the removal of the strict timelines for claim decisions and appeals violates ERISA regulations concerning timely claims processing, which are designed to protect employee benefits. The explicit need for 'plain language' describing reasons for denial is also removed.",

If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall not be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Company Default\" shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Policy if the Company fails to pay a premium on the Policy as required under the terms of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after the due date for such premium, or if the Company processes or attempts to process a policy loan, or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust.

                "explanation": "The original text outlines specific conditions under which a Company Default occurs and the procedures for the Trust to respond. By removing the specific timelines for notification and cure, and weakening the right of the Trust to ensure a cure or transfer of policy interest in case of a default, the amendment introduces ambiguity and reduces the Trust's protection. Moreover, the explicit requirement for the company to notify the Trustees within five business days of a Company Default is removed, which limits the trustee's ability to identify and respond quickly to protect the trust's interest. This could breach fiduciary duty and impair the trust's ability to address defaults, which are implicitly protected under ERISA. This creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum standards for fulfilling fiduciary duties.",

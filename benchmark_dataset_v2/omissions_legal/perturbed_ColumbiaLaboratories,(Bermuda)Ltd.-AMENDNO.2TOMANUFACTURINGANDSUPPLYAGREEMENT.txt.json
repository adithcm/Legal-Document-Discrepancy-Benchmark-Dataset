                "original_text": "Fleet and Columbia shall maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, including product liability insurance against claims regarding the manufacture of Product under this Agreement and sufficient cover to meet its liabilities under this Agreement in respect of the Columbia Equipment, with insurers having an AM Best rating within the top 2 categories at the time (at the date of this Agreement known as \"superior\" or \"excellent\") or reasonably comparable coverage, in such amounts as it customarily maintains for similar products and activities, but in no event less than [***] per individual claim and [***] in the aggregate. Each party shall maintain such insurance during the Term and thereafter for so long as it customarily maintains insurance for itself for similar products and activities (but in no event less than [***] following termination or expiration).",

Each party shall maintain such insurance during the Term.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for 'comprehensive' insurance and deleting the mandatory minimum coverage amounts, the clause now contradicts implied obligations under UK law (specifically, the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and general principles of negligence). These omissions expose Columbia to potentially uncovered liabilities if Fleet's general liability coverage is insufficient to address product liability claims or other liabilities arising from the agreement.",

Neither party shall, during the period of this Agreement nor for five (5) years thereafter, without the other party's express prior written consent, other than as provided under this Agreement, use or disclose any such Confidential Information for any purpose other than to carry out its obligations hereunder.

                "explanation": "The omission of the phrase 'except as to such information it may be required to retain under Applicable Law, and except for one copy of such information to be retained by such party's legal counsel' introduces a contradiction with legal and regulatory requirements in both the UK and Bermuda (where Columbia is incorporated). Companies are often legally obligated to retain certain records for compliance and audit purposes. For example, Companies Act 2006 (UK) and Bermuda Companies Act 1981. Removing this exception would create legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'irrevocably' and the phrase 'sole and exclusive', the clause no longer unequivocally establishes the English courts as the only forum for dispute resolution. This omission introduces ambiguity, potentially allowing parties to pursue legal action in other jurisdictions. This creates a legal risk because it undermines the contractual intent to have disputes resolved exclusively in England, potentially conflicting with principles of contract law regarding clear jurisdictional agreements.",

                "original_text": "Each Party will indemnify the Company and hold it harmless for, from and against any claims, demands, costs or expenses arising out of or relating to such consolidated financial statements, provided that such indemnity shall not apply to claims, demands, costs or expenses to the extent they are related to the Company's financial statements provided to such Party.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'provided that such indemnity shall not apply to claims, demands, costs or expenses to the extent they are related to the Company's financial statements provided to such Party' eliminates an important exception, thereby making each party potentially liable for errors in the Company's own financial statements. This creates a legal risk because under general principles of corporate law, parties are not usually indemnified for damages that arise from their own negligence or misconduct. This contradicts standard indemnity principles.",

By removing acknowledgement that the other parties *could* consult their own counsel, creates an impression the other party may be at a disadvantage by not having their own counsel. This creates legal risk as, in later disputes, the other parties can plausibly argue they didn't fully understand the risks due to not having their own representation.",

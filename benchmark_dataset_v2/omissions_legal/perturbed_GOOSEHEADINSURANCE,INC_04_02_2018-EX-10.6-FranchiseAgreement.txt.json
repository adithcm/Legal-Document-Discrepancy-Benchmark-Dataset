Such policy or policies must be written by an insurance company or companies we have approved, having at all times a rating of at least \"A-\" in the most recent Key Rating Guide published by the A.M. Best Company (or another rating that we reasonably designate if A.M. Best Company no longer publishes the Key Rating Guide) and licensed and admitted to do business in the state in which the Franchised Business is located, and must include, at a minimum (except that we may reasonably specify additional coverages and higher policy limits for all franchisees periodically in the Manual or otherwise in writing to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in the law or standards of liability, higher damage awards and other relevant changes in circumstances), the following:",

                "explanation": "The original clause ensures policies are up to standard by requiring companies with a rating of \"A-\" or better by A.M. Best and including a range of policies like liability, indemnity, auto, workers' comp, cyber, umbrella, and property insurance. The modified version allows for lower quality insurance companies and significantly reduces the liability coverage, creating a **legal contradiction** with state and federal laws that mandate specific insurance requirements and coverage levels for businesses and employees.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific endorsements, detailed in the manual, and requires a waiver of subrogation, protecting both parties from claims against each other's insurers. The modified version makes these endorsements optional and weakens the subrogation waiver. This introduces a **legal risk** with potential conflicts with insurance regulations which often mandate specific endorsements for commercial policies and rely on subrogation waivers to allocate risk and prevent double recovery.",

All certificates must expressly provide that we will receive at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice if there is a material alteration to, cancellation, or non-renewal of the coverages evidenced by such certificates. Additional certificates evidencing the insurance required by Section 15.1 above must name us, and each of our affiliates, directors, agents, and employees, as additional insured parties, and must expressly provide that any interest of same therein will not be affected by any breach by you of any policy provisions for which such certificates evidence coverage.",

The modified version makes providing certificates of insurance optional, the notice period not mandatory and the additional insured clause not required.

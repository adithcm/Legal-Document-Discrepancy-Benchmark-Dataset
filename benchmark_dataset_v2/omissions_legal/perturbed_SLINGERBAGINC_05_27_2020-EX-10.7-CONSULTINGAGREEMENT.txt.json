                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Consultant shall be eligible to participate in benefit plans currently and hereafter maintained by the Company of general applicability to other consultants of the Company. Subject to the following sentence, the Consultant will be entitled to receive up to a one-time bonus of 1,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company promptly after the value of the Company's outstanding stock equals $100 million dollars.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant may participate in benefit plans currently maintained by the Company.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guarantee of eligibility for benefit plans generally applicable to other consultants and eliminating the one-time bonus based on the company's stock value, the contract violates the principle of equal treatment. In the United States, while there is no general law mandating equal benefits for all consultants, this omission creates a legal risk under general contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially if similarly situated consultants receive better benefits. This alteration also could be seen as a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in New York contract law, given the agreement is governed by New York law.",

                "original_text": "In such case, 100% of the Consultant's unvested stock and, if applicable, option or warrant compensation of any nature will vest without any further action required on the part of the Consultant or the Company and the Company will deliver to the order of the Consultant promptly upon receipt of a written demand of the Consultant such shares of common stock or options at its sole expense as become due to Consultant hereunder. The Consultant's right to receive compensation whether in cash or securities shall survive any termination of this Agreement Without Cause.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant's right to receive compensation may be subject to further review upon termination.",
                "explanation": "This deletion weakens the 'Termination Without Cause' clause. By removing the assurance that the Consultant's right to receive compensation shall survive any termination, and suggesting potential 'further review' upon termination by the Company, the contract contradicts the law. Under New York law, contracts are expected to clearly define termination conditions, and any discretionary review could allow for arbitrary denial of compensation, breaching implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under New York contract law.",

                "original_text": "Upon the termination (whether for cause, disability, death, without cause, or by way of change of control), the Company shall pay to Consultant on the date required under applicable law: (i) any accrued but unpaid Base Consulting Fee for services rendered as of the date of termination, (ii) (if applicable) any accrued but unpaid vacation pay, and (iii) the business expenses reasonably incurred by the Consultant up to the date of termination or resignation and properly reimbursable, in each case less any applicable deductions or withholdings required by law.",
                "changed_text": "Upon termination, the Company may pay any accrued Base Consulting Fee.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall pay' to 'may pay' and removing references to other legally required payments (vacation pay, business expenses) upon termination, this violates New York labor laws regarding final wage payments. New York law requires prompt payment of all earned wages upon termination. This gives the company discretionary power to withhold payments, introducing a legal risk.",

                "original_text": "In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts shall instruct the placement agents or underwriters to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as wide a distribution of the Shares as is reasonably practicable without adversely affecting the pricing thereof and (ii) not sell any Shares to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) who, upon completion of the Offering, would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power).",
                "changed_text": "In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts may consider instructing the placement agents or underwriters to use efforts to (i) effect a distribution of the Shares and (ii) sell Shares to persons or Groups as they see fit.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for 'reasonable best efforts' to effect a wide distribution and to avoid selling to entities that would exceed ownership thresholds. This omission introduces a legal contradiction because securities laws prioritize fair and wide distribution to prevent market manipulation and ensure transparency, particularly in offerings. By weakening these requirements, the contract increases the risk of insider trading and concentrated ownership, violating securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS AFFILIATES TO WAIVE' is removed, weakening the jury waiver. While jury waivers are generally enforceable, they are scrutinized and must be knowing and voluntary. By removing the 'fullest extent permitted by law' and 'cause its affiliates to waive' phrasing, the contract creates ambiguity and potential grounds for challenging the waiver's validity. This contradicts the legal principle of ensuring waivers are clear, unambiguous, and fully informed, introducing legal risk.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'several and not jointly,' 'no further action or approval is required on its behalf,' and 'valid and binding' weakens the representations. The parties no longer explicitly represent they are individually authorized and fully compliant, or that the agreement is binding under its terms. This omission could create uncertainty about each party's authority and obligations, potentially violating contract law principles requiring clear mutual assent and enforceability. It omits a critical requirement of a contract.",

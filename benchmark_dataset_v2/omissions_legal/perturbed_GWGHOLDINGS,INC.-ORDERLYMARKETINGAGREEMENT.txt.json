EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW\" from the jury waiver, the contract now implies an absolute waiver of jury trial rights, regardless of legal limitations. This creates a contradiction with consumer protection laws, potentially invalidating the waiver in jurisdictions where such waivers are restricted or require specific conditions. This omission introduces significant legal risk.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but generally relates to consumer protection laws and the enforceability of jury waivers in contracts. Specific statutes and case law govern the allowed scope and conditions for such waivers.",

                "explanation": "Removing registered/certified mail and overnight delivery options for legal notices significantly weakens consumer protections. Many states require specific methods of delivery for legal notices to ensure receipt and create a verifiable record. Omitting these methods creates a legal loophole by making it easier for one party (likely the company) to claim a notice was not properly delivered, potentially harming the other party's rights. This omission opens the door to legal challenges based on improper notice.",
                "contradicted_law": "State laws regarding proper notice for legal communications (e.g., breach of contract, termination notices). These laws often specify or prioritize registered/certified mail for ensuring verifiable delivery.",

Any provision of this OMA that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof but shall be interpreted as if it were written so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'but shall be interpreted as if it were written so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law' significantly alters the severability clause. Without this clause, a court is less likely to interpret a problematic provision in a way that preserves the contract's overall validity. This increases the risk that a single unenforceable clause could invalidate the entire agreement, creating legal uncertainty and potentially harming consumers who rely on the contract's other provisions. This omission contradicts the principle of upholding contracts to the extent legally possible.",

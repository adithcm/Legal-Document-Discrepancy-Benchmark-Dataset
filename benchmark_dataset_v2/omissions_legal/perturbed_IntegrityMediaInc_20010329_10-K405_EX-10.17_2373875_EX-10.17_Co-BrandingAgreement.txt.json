Only products          which have been paid or credited to the account of the seller shall be          deemed sold. No royalties will be payable on the sales of any products          by any third-party distributors or licensees until such time as          accountings and payment or final credit therefor has been received by          the paying party. Either party, at its sole expense, upon at least          thirty (30) days written notice (and not more than once in respect of          any accounting period) will have the right to inspect the other party's          books regarding the obligations hereunder for a period of two (2) years          from the date on which any statement is rendered. Such auditing party          must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period.          Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements          or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as          between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason          whatsoever. Provided the objecting party has made timely written          objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same          within two (2) years and six (6) months after the applicable statement          is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",
                "changed_text": "Accounting statements and, if applicable, royalty payments for products sold will be rendered by each party at their discretion. Only products which have been paid or credited to the account of the seller shall be deemed sold. No royalties will be payable on the sales of any products by any third-party distributors or licensees. Either party may inspect the other party's books; however, any discrepancies must be raised within a timeframe solely determined by the book-holding party. Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as between the parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the stipulation of 'quarterly within sixty (60) days' for accounting statements and changing 'at their discretion', this creates uncertainty and potential delays, which could violate regulations requiring timely and transparent financial reporting. The removal of the 'two (2) years' timeframe to inspect obligations severely limits the rights of the non-book-holding party to verify proper accounting, rendering the statement an account stated. The deletion of the 'two (2) years and six (6) months' limit to file actions, gives absolute power to the book-holding party.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract law - Tennessee, where the agreement is enforced, requires good faith and fair dealing, which is undermined by the arbitrary accounting process and limited auditing rights. U.S. contract law generally requires reasonable terms and conditions.",

Pending the          determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the          non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to          withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in          an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its          estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'          fees) in connection therewith.",

                "explanation": "The original indemnification clause provides broad protection against various types of losses and expenses. By omitting 'save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement' and only referring to 'claims arising out of or connected with this Agreement', the scope is narrowed, leaving the indemnified party vulnerable to uncovered liabilities.",

Accordingly, each party hereto consents and submits to the jurisdiction determined by Integrity.",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'applicable to contracts entered into and performed entirely within the State of Tennessee' and 'The prevailing party in any such dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection therewith in addition to the costs thereof' while granting Integrity the sole authority to determine the venue, significantly disadvantages Time Life.

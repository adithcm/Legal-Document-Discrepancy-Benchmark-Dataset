                "explanation": "The removal of the specific minimum coverage limits ($1,000,000 combined single limit and $2,000,000 in the aggregate) weakens the insurance requirement and potentially violates Texas state laws regarding minimum insurance coverage for contractors, which may mandate specific coverage amounts depending on the type of work performed. Additionally, removing the mandate for \"per location or per project\" aggregates reduces the protection for EDGE, making it harder to make claim on the insurance. The original terms offer more legal protection.",

                "changed_text": "Workers' Compensation Insurance as required by state law where the Work is performed. Employer Liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"with limits of at least $1,000,000 for each occurrence,\" the contract no longer explicitly mandates a minimum level of Employer Liability insurance. In Texas, while workers' compensation is not mandatory for all employers, if an employer opts out, they must maintain a certain level of employer's liability insurance to cover employee injuries. This weakens the protection for EDGE and creates a potential legal risk if the subcontractor's coverage is inadequate under Texas law.",

However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control.

                "explanation": "The omission of the phrase 'However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.' weakens EDGE's control over the subcontracting process. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in Texas contract law, which requires parties to cooperate and not hinder each other's performance of the contract. By removing EDGE's ability to influence subcontracting decisions, the contract creates a legal risk if the subcontractor hires unqualified or unreliable lower-tier subcontractors, potentially impacting the quality of the work and exposing EDGE to liability.",

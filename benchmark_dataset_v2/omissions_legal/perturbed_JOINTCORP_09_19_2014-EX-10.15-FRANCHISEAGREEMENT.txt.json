Best rating of A-VIII or better approved by us, and in such amounts as we may determine from time to time: (1) comprehensive public, professional, product, medical malpractice and motor vehicle liability insurance against claims for bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the operation of the Franchise or otherwise in conjunction with your conduct of the Franchise Business pursuant to this Agreement, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage amounts as set forth in the Operations Manual; (2) general casualty insurance, including theft, cash theft, fire and extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief insurance, for the replacement value of the Franchise and its contents, and any other assets of the Franchise; (3) worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as required by law, with limits equal to or in excess of those required by statute; (4) business interruption insurance for a period adequate to reestablish normal business operations, but in any event not less than six (6) months; (5) any other insurance required by applicable law, rule, regulation, ordinance or licensing requirements; and (6) umbrella liability coverage with limits of not less than $1,000,000/$3,000,000 or such other amounts that we may establish in the Operations Manual.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive', 'professional', 'product', 'medical malpractice', 'motor vehicle liability insurance', the A.M. Best rating requirement, the 'minimum liability coverage amounts as set forth in the Operations Manual', and specific time limits for business interruption coverage significantly weakens the insurance requirement and removes key protections for both the franchisee and third parties. This creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts and types of insurance for businesses, particularly those providing healthcare services, as this franchise does. Furthermore, specifying to only include worker's compensation insurance as required by law removes additional insurance such as employer's liability insurance which can be seen as a consumer and worker protection.",

                "explanation": "The deletion of 'copies of policies evidencing the existence of such insurance concurrently with execution of this Agreement and prior to each subsequent renewal date of each insurance policy, along with certificates evidencing such insurance' and 'to defend' removes important compliance measures, making it more difficult for the franchisor to verify that the franchisee is maintaining the required insurance coverage and to have active participation in the claims.",

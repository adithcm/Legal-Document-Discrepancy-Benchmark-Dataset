                "explanation": "The removal of the second succinic acid production facility based in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada undermines regulatory oversight. In Ontario, environmental regulations necessitate stringent environmental impact assessments and public consultations for facilities of this scale, mandated by the Environmental Assessment Act. Omitting reference to the Sarnia Plant attempts to bypass Canadian regulatory requirements, increasing environmental risk and liability, specifically contradicting the required transparency and compliance protocols.",

New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   \"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"",

                "explanation": "Removing the obligation to convert the Sarnia Plant to utilize CB1 circumvents the regulatory and safety requirements associated with biocatalyst use in Canada. Canadian regulations, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, mandate a rigorous assessment of biocatalysts to prevent environmental harm. By removing this commitment, the contract facilitates a potentially unregulated application of the Mitsubishi strain (MCC-17), raising serious concerns about non-compliance with Canadian law.",

                "explanation": "Deleting the requirement for Bioamber to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain directly contradicts regulatory requirements for biotechnology applications in both France (Pomacle) and Canada (Sarnia). In France, compliance with EU directives on contained use of genetically modified microorganisms (Directive 2009/41/EC) is mandatory. Canada requires approvals under the New Substances Notification Regulations of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 for new biocatalysts. Removing the obligation to seek regulatory approval introduces significant legal and operational risks for Bioamber and its licensees.",

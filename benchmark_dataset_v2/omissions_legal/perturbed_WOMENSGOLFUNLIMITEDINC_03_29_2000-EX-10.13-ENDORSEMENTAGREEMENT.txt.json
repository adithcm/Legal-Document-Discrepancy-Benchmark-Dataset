                "explanation": "This change makes reimbursement for travel expenses discretionary rather than obligatory. Independent contractors in New Jersey, where the company is incorporated, have certain legal protections regarding expense reimbursement when those expenses are integral to performing the contracted services. By making it discretionary, the contract creates a loophole that could violate state labor laws regarding independent contractor rights.",

The Company may require the Professional to provide insurance certificates evidencing the same.",
                "changed_text": "6.4 The Professional agrees to maintain insurance coverage. The Company may request proof of insurance.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement for specific types and levels of insurance (health, worker's compensation, automobile, general liability). While the original text is broad, it suggests a responsibility for the professional to maintain adequate coverage. Removing this detail introduces ambiguity and reduces the professional's liability obligations, potentially violating New Jersey law that requires businesses to ensure adequate insurance coverage for potential liabilities, particularly in cases where the independent contractor's activities directly benefit the company.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to New Jersey law, and only referencing 'principles of law generally' the contract introduces ambiguity about which laws actually govern the contract. New Jersey has specific statutes regarding consumer protection and contractual obligations. This vagueness could allow the company to argue for interpretations that weaken consumer (Professional) protections mandated under New Jersey law. This omission could allow the company to circumvent specific consumer protection laws enacted by the state of New Jersey. ",

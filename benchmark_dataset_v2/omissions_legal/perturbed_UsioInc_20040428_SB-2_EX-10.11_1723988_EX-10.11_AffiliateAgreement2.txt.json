                "original_text": "Affiliate shall use its best efforts to market and sell to  commercial businesses the Services of Network 1 and Network 1's subsidiaries and  to  locate individuals who are willing and capable of acting as Contractors of  Network  1  and Affiliate subject to the approval of all such individuals by Network  1  as  set  out  in  Section  2.01  [CONTRACTORS].  All  such Contractors must process Merchant applications and transactions exclusively through Network 1.  Network 1 consents  to  waive  said  exclusivity  requirement  with  respect  to  specific Merchants  in  the  event  Network  1 (i) is unable to process for such specific Merchant,  and  (ii)  the  declined Merchant is not accepted for processing by a provider  that Network 1 designates for specific Merchant's that are declined by Network  1  (\"B  Bank  Source\").  Affiliate  shall  disclose  to  Network  1 all information  known  to  Affiliate  with  respect  to  the background, character, employment  history,  business  experience  and other information regarding each prospective  Contractor  relevant to Network 1's determination whether to accept or  not  accept  each  prospective  Contractor.",

All such Contractors must process Merchant applications and transactions through Network 1.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'best efforts,' the clause that allows Network 1 to waive exclusivity requirements for specific merchants, and the clause requiring Affiliate to disclose all information known to Affiliate about prospective contractors removes essential obligations and protections. Eliminating the 'best efforts' weakens the affiliate's obligation. Omitting the exclusivity waiver and required disclosures introduces legal risk by potentially violating regulations regarding fair dealing and transparency in business relationships, impacting Network 1's ability to fully assess contractor suitability and creating potential liability for undisclosed issues with contractors.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement of thirty-days (30) prior written notification before modifying Affiliate's Fees introduces a legal contradiction by removing a key protection for the Affiliate. This violates principles of contract law requiring reasonable notice for significant changes and could be deemed unconscionable or a breach of good faith depending on state law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the location of arbitration depending on who is making the claim, as well as removing the arbitration being in accordance with the American Arbitration Association introduces bias and lacks transparency.

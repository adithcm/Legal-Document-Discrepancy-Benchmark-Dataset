                "explanation": "By removing 'reasonably', 'upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours', 'at Seller's expense', and 'reasonable' from this clause, the contract eliminates limitations on the Seller's quality control inspections. This omission creates a **legal contradiction** because quality control clauses in trademark licenses must be reasonable to be enforceable. Removing these qualifiers introduces the risk that the Seller's quality control measures could become overly burdensome or intrusive, potentially violating **trademark law** principles that protect licensees from unreasonable interference.",

Each party shall not (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates not to) (i) disclose any such Source Code, trade secrets, or confidential information to any Person other than to (a) those of its employees who have a \"need to know,\" or (b) other third Persons (including customers, suppliers, prospective suppliers, or joint developers), or (ii) use or disclose such Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information except as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this IP Agreement in accordance with any applicable restrictions or obligations with respect thereto, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), under written Contracts (which include confidentiality, use, and disclosure restrictions) normally used by such party to protect its own similar confidential or proprietary information (and in no event less stringent than the terms and conditions of this Article V).",

                "explanation": "The original text includes a clause that provides a baseline level of care for confidential information, stating it has to be protected with at least the same degree of care as the party's own similar information, but no less than a 'reasonable degree of care.' The removal of this line and the written contract condition eliminates the assurance of a reasonable standard of care for confidential information, and of the requirement for written contracts when disclosing the information. This creates **legal risk** under **trade secret law**, which requires reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy. It could be argued that simply holding information 'in confidence' without specifying a reasonable degree of care is insufficient, making it difficult to enforce trade secret protection.",

                "explanation": "By deleting 'only by a written agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to this IP Agreement' the contract allows for verbal or unsigned amendments. Contract law generally requires that certain types of agreements, or amendments to agreements, be in writing to be enforceable. By omitting the writing requirement, the contract creates ambiguity and potential unenforceability of amendments, thus introducing **legal risk**. In some jurisdictions, modifications to contracts involving significant intellectual property rights may need to be in writing to be valid under the **Statute of Frauds** or similar legal principles.",

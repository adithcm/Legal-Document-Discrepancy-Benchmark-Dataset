                "explanation": "Removing 'perpetual (unless terminated in accordance with Section 4.2(ii)(c)), fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, non-transferable (except as set forth herein), non-exclusive' significantly weakens the trademark license. This introduces a legal contradiction as trademark licenses, especially those related to established brands, typically have defined terms and royalty structures. Removing the clarity around these aspects creates potential for disputes and undermines the intended purpose of the license.",

The quality control clause ensures that products maintain a certain level of quality, protecting the trademark's reputation.

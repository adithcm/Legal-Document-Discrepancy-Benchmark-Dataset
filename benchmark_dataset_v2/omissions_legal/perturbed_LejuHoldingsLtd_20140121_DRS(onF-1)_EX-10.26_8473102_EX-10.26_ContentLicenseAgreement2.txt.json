                "original_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the PRC, without regard to conflicts of law principles.",
                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement shall be governed by principles of equity and fairness.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the laws of the PRC, the agreement becomes vague and potentially unenforceable. The PRC has specific contract laws that protect parties; omitting this clause allows for arbitrary interpretations, potentially disadvantaging one party. This introduces legal risk as it bypasses established legal frameworks for contract enforcement in China.",

                "changed_text": "Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that the Agreement shall terminate.",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination,' the clause introduces ambiguity. It is unclear if any clauses from the original agreement might still be relevant, contradicting standard contract law principles which seek clear termination terms.",

                "changed_text": "This Termination Agreement represents the agreement between the parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'complete, integrated, and entire' and the requirement for written modification, it opens the door to disputes about whether other agreements or verbal understandings are also part of the contract, and how it can be changed. This could contradict the principle of 'entire agreement' clauses commonly enforced to ensure clarity and prevent misunderstandings, as found in PRC contract law.",

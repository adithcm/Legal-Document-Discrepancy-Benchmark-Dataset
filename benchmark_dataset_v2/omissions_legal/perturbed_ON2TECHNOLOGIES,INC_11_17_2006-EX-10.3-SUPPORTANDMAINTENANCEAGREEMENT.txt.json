In California, where Wildform is located, implied warranties can arise by law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). By omitting the explicit disclaimer of these warranties, the contract becomes ambiguous and might be interpreted as not fully protecting the seller (Wildform) from claims related to the quality or suitability of the deliverables.",

On2 will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wildform as necessary in completing the Development Work and delivery of the Deliverables. Upon receipt of each Deliverable, On2 shall have a period of thirty (30) working days within which to inspect such Deliverable based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\"). Should On2 find that any Deliverable does not substantially conform to the relevant Specification, On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing, which notice shall provide sufficiently detailed explanation of the non-conformities so as to allow Wildform to reproduce them (any such notice is referred to herein as a \"Nonconformance Notice\"). Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable. In the event that Wildform receives such Nonconformance Notice from On2, Wildform shall make commercially reasonable efforts to modify such Deliverable and re-deliver it to On2 after any such modification is completed. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted by On2 when either (i) On2 notifies Wildform in writing of its acceptance of such Deliverables or (ii) On2 does not deliver a Nonconformance Notice to Wildform within the Acceptance Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the 'Acceptance Period' and the part on 'non-conformities' introduces a significant legal risk. By removing the timeframe and specific process for rejection, the contract becomes vague regarding acceptance. This could be seen as unfair or unconscionable, as it eliminates a defined process for the buyer to reject non-conforming goods, potentially conflicting with California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. This weakens the buyer's (On2) rights.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'provided that such defect or conflict cannot reasonably be corrected except through modification of the product of such other companies' significantly alters Wildform's obligations. This clause, as originally written, limits Wildform's responsibility only when the error cannot be fixed without modifying a third-party product. By omitting this, Wildform is now not required to provide corrections even if it is reasonably possible to do so, as long as the error is related to third-party software. This weakens On2's protection and could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if Wildform refuses to correct easily fixable errors.",

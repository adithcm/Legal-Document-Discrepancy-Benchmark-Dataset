                "original_text": "Cancellation of any policy in force, when requested in writing by the\ninsured, will be honored by MICOA, except for those MICOA is not\notherwise permitted to cancel.",
                "changed_text": "Cancellation of any policy in force will be subject to MICOA's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Nevada law provides specific consumer rights regarding the cancellation of insurance policies, including timelines and procedures. By removing the phrase \"when requested in writing by the insured, will be honored by MICOA, except for those MICOA is not otherwise permitted to cancel\" and replacing it with \"will be subject to MICOA's discretion\", the contract now contradicts Nevada's consumer protection laws regarding insurance policy cancellations, giving MICOA unilateral power to reject cancellation requests even when they meet legal requirements.",

                "original_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date. In return for this payment, for a two-year period following the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, MICOA may, at its sole discretion, purchase from Agency Agency's ownership interest in the expirations for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The purchase price, if MICOA elects to purchase, will be determined by MICOA.",
                "explanation": "Nevada law protects insurance agencies' ownership of expirations. The original clause provided a defined calculation of purchase price. By changing 'MICOA agrees to purchase' to 'MICOA may, at its sole discretion, purchase,' and removing the calculation for 'purchase price', the modified contract effectively eliminates the agency's legally protected right to compensation for their book of business upon termination, contradicting Nevada law.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence \"Any provisions of this Agreement or any amendments to the Agreement that are or become in conflict with any applicable statutes or regulations shall be deemed to be amended to conform to those statutes or regulations.\", the contract no longer automatically adjusts to comply with Nevada law. This omission creates a legal risk because if any clause in the contract conflicts with Nevada statutes, the contract doesn't explicitly state it will be amended to conform, potentially leaving the agency vulnerable to non-compliant terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principle requiring contracts to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Also, it creates a risk that the previously mentioned violations are not automatically corrected.",

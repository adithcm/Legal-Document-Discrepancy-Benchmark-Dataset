                "original_text": "The Company agrees to pay:\n(i) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;\n(ii) the costs of distributing the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;\n(iii) the fees and expenses of qualifying the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions as provided in Section 5(b) and of preparing and distributing a Blue Sky Memorandum (including related fees and expenses of counsel to the Remarketing Agent); and\n(iv) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Issuers hereunder. The Trust shall not be liable for any fees and expenses in this Section.",
                "changed_text": "The Company agrees to pay:\n(i) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;\n(ii) the costs of distributing the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;\n(iii) the fees and expenses of qualifying the Remarketing Securities under the securities laws of one jurisdiction as chosen by the company and of preparing and distributing a Blue Sky Memorandum (including related fees and expenses of counsel to the Remarketing Agent); and\n(iv) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Issuers hereunder. The Trust shall not be liable for any fees and expenses in this Section.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'several' and replaced by 'one' in the qualification requirements could introduce legal risk. Securities laws often require offerings to be qualified in multiple jurisdictions to protect investors. Limiting the qualification to 'one jurisdiction as chosen by the company' could lead to non-compliance with state and federal securities laws, potentially resulting in legal challenges and liabilities.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'may' introduces uncertainty regarding the company's obligation to cover these essential remarketing expenses. This is a material change that could impact the Remarketing Agent's willingness to participate, and some may consider this a form of economic duress, especially if these costs are significant. This can lead to legal complications regarding breach of contract or failure to execute remarketing duties due to a lack of resources.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'in all material respects' from the certification requirement regarding the accuracy of representations, warranties, and agreements introduces a higher standard of absolute accuracy. While seemingly innocuous, this shift places an unreasonable burden on the company to ensure every single aspect of the representations is perfectly accurate, regardless of materiality. Any minor, immaterial inaccuracy could be argued as a breach of this certification, leading to legal challenges.",

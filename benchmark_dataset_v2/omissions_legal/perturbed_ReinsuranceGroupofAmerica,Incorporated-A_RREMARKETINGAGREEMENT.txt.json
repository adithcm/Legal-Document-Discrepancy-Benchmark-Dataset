The Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective and the Company is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Since the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in each of the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) in accordance with the rules and regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") and the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures (a) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance.",

                "explanation": "By removing the assertions that the internal controls provide 'reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting' and that the 'internal control over financial reporting is effective', and removing the guarantee from the Company's CEO and CFO, the contract weakens the guarantees around financial reporting, undermining investor protections mandated by Sarbanes-Oxley.",

During the Term and for a period of two (2) years after the termination of the Agreement or the expiry date of the last batch manufactured whichever is later, thereafter, each Party shall obtain and maintain, at its sole expense adequate product liability insurance for the Product as it reasonably deems necessary and appropriate. Evidence of coverage, in the form of certificates of insurance, shall be provided promptly upon registration of the Product in given countries and as reasonably requested thereafter.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirements to maintain adequate insurance for two years after termination and removing the requirements to provide the 'certificate of insurance', the change weakens the consumer rights protections, particularly regarding product liability. New York law (governing law of the agreement) mandates 'reasonable care' in product manufacturing and distribution, and adequate insurance coverage is a key component of demonstrating such care. Eliminating mandatory evidence provision hinders demonstrating financial responsibility.",

In the event that either Party believes it may be necessary to conduct a recall, field correction, market withdrawal, stock recovery, or other similar action with respect to any Product which was sold under this Agreement (a \"Recall\"), CARDAX and CAPSUGEL shall promptly consult with each other in good faith as to how best to proceed, it being understood and agreed that the final decision as to any Recall of any Product sold by Marketer(s) shall be made jointly; provided, however, that neither Party shall be prohibited hereunder from taking any action that it is required to take by Applicable Law or taking Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate the loss from any Recall or seizure or to protect the public. Each of CAPSUGEL and CARDAX shall make a permanent, complete and accurate record of all costs incurred by it in connection with any Product Recall or seizure. With respect to any Recall or seizure of any Product caused by the negligence, mistake or omission of CAPSUGEL, CAPSUGEL shall (i) reimburse CARDAX for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by CARDAX in connection with the Recall or seizure, including, without limitation, replacing the Product subject to the Recall or seizure in accordance with this Agreement; and (ii) as provided in Section 8.1, indemnify and save CARDAX and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all damages to or claims by third parties associated (or Affiliated) with or resulting from any such Recall or seizure. With respect to any Recall or seizure caused by the negligence, mistake or omission of CARDAX (including but not limited to failure of the Active Ingredient to meet the Specifications), CARDAX shall: (i) reimburse CAPSUGEL for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by CAPSUGEL in connection with the Recall or seizure; and (ii) as provided in Section 8.2, indemnify and save CAPSUGEL and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all damages to or claims by third parties associated with or resulting from any such Recall or seizure.",

In the event that either Party believes it may be necessary to conduct a recall, field correction, market withdrawal, stock recovery, or other similar action with respect to any Product which was sold under this Agreement (a \"Recall\"), CARDAX and CAPSUGEL may consult with each other. The final decision as to any Recall of any Product sold by Marketer(s) shall be made independently by each Party.

                "explanation": "This modification weakens the recall process. By changing 'shall promptly consult' to 'may consult' and removing the 'joint decision' requirement, the agreement reduces consumer safety protections. The change from 'shall reimburse' to 'may reimburse' shifts recall cost responsibilities, reducing financial accountability and creating potential non-compliance with product safety regulations in NY. The omission of a permanent, complete record and the specific requirements for cost reimbursement after recalls creates legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'has and shall continue to comply' to 'intends to follow' weakens CAPSUGEL's warranty regarding compliance with Applicable Laws. This creates a legal loophole as it lowers the standard from a guarantee of compliance to a mere statement of intent. New York law, which governs the agreement (Section 11.1), requires adherence to all laws. This change introduces legal risk and a contradiction with the required legal standard for business operations.",

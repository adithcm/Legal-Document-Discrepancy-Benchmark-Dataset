                "original_text": "CAPSUGEL shall pay to CARDAX a royalty equal to [***] of the Adjusted Net Sales (\"Royalty Payment\") within [***] after the end of [***].",
                "changed_text": "CAPSUGEL may, at its discretion, pay CARDAX a royalty based on a percentage of Adjusted Net Sales, with the amount and timing of such payments to be determined solely by CAPSUGEL.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation for Capsugel to pay royalties to Cardax, making royalty payments discretionary. This violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which exists in every contract under New York law (the governing law per Section 11.1). By making royalty payments entirely discretionary, Capsugel could potentially avoid paying any royalties at all, frustrating the entire purpose of the collaboration agreement for Cardax.",

                "changed_text": "CAPSUGEL shall notify CARDAX of any contact or communication from any governmental or regulatory authority, including without limitation the FDA, that in any way relates to or may have an impact on a Product or the CAPSUGEL Development Activities if CAPSUGEL deems it necessary.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the mandatory timeframe for notification and adds a condition that CAPSUGEL notify CARDAX 'if CAPSUGEL deems it necessary'. This violates FDA regulations regarding timely reporting of safety issues or adverse events related to pharmaceutical products. The FDA requires prompt reporting to ensure public safety. This omission allows CAPSUGEL to potentially delay or withhold crucial information, creating a legal risk.",

The final decision as to any Recall of any Product sold by Marketer(s) shall be made by CAPSUGEL at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change grants CAPSUGEL sole decision-making authority regarding product recalls, removing the requirement for joint decision-making and good faith consultation. In situations involving adulterated or misbranded products that pose a health risk, the FD&C Act places legal responsibility on both manufacturers and distributors. By unilaterally controlling the recall decision, CAPSUGEL could potentially delay or avoid a recall necessary to protect public health, thus violating the FD&C Act.",

                "original_text": "Without limiting or qualifying the Sponsor's liabilities, obligations, or indemnities, before the Event, the Sponsor will obtain, at its sole cost and expense, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy from a company acceptable to ANTHEMIC and authorized to do business in the state of Illinois with limits of no less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $2,000,000.00 as an annual aggregate. The insurance mentioned in the preceding sentence will name ANTHEMIC as additional insured. The Sponsor will also maintain any statutorily required workers compensation insurance. The Sponsor will provide ANTHEMIC with properly executed certificates of insurance before the Sponsor provides any products or services at the Event, and the insurance will contain a provision that it cannot be reduced or cancelled unless and until the insurance company notifies ANTHEMIC. Any third party that performs services on the Event grounds on behalf of the Sponsor will be required to satisfy the same insurance requirements as provided in this section.",

The Sponsor will provide ANTHEMIC with certificates of insurance before the Sponsor provides any products or services at the Event.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive', the specific liability limits ($1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $2,000,000.00 as an annual aggregate) and the provision that the insurance cannot be reduced or cancelled until the insurance company notifies ANTHEMIC significantly weakens the insurance requirements. It also makes the workers compensation requirement more vague. This creates a legal contradiction with Illinois state law that mandates specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial activities and notification requirements for insurance policy changes.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'EXCEPT FOR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES,' the limitation of damages clause is broadened to include indemnification obligations. This directly contradicts standard legal practice and case law which typically holds parties responsible for indemnifying third-party claims, even when consequential damages are limited between the contracting parties. This omission introduces significant legal risk and can be seen as a violation of good faith dealing under California law, the governing law of the agreement.",

The venue for resolution of any dispute related to this Agreement will be determined at ANTHEMIC's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing the clause to allow ANTHEMIC to determine the venue for dispute resolution, the agreement removes the sponsor's right to a pre-determined, mutually agreed-upon venue. While parties can generally agree on venue, some states have consumer protection laws that restrict or invalidate venue clauses that force consumers (or smaller entities) to litigate in distant or inconvenient locations. If VNUE (the sponsor) were considered a smaller, less sophisticated entity compared to ANTHEMIC, this clause could be challenged as unconscionable under California consumer protection laws. This is especially true if ANTHEMIC chose a venue that made it excessively difficult for VNUE to pursue a claim. This creates a legal contradiction regarding fair business practice.",

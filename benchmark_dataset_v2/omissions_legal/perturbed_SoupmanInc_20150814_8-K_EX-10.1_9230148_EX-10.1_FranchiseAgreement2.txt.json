                "original_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of such state shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state's conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and if the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located outside of such state and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee's franchised business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the county and state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "changed_text": "H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor chooses. Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a specific, though potentially complex, choice-of-law provision, that at least considers the location of the franchisee's business. The modified clause removes the franchisee's location consideration and allows the Franchisor to choose the governing law without constraints. This could violate state franchise laws that are designed to protect franchisees and that may restrict the franchisor's ability to unilaterally select a favorable jurisdiction. Many states have franchise relationship laws that govern the termination, non-renewal, and transfer of franchises. Eliminating consideration of the franchisee's location allows the franchisor to potentially evade these protections.",

Without affecting the Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor, without notice to the Guarantors, may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive notice of amendment of the Master Franchise Agreement and notice of demand for payment or performance by Master Franchisee.",
                "changed_text": "E. Without affecting the Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee, Franchisor may extend, modify, or release any indebtedness or obligation of Master Franchisee, or settle, adjust, or compromise any claims against Master Franchisee. Guarantors waive all rights and defenses available to a surety or guarantor.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that the Franchisor can take actions related to the Master Franchisee's obligations without notifying the Guarantors, and the Guarantors waive notice of specific actions. However, the modified clause goes further by stating that the Guarantors waive *all* rights and defenses available to them as a surety or guarantor. This is a significant expansion of the waiver. Many jurisdictions have laws that protect the rights of sureties and guarantors, such as the right to be discharged from their obligations if the underlying debt is materially altered without their consent. By waiving *all* rights and defenses, the Guarantors could be unknowingly relinquishing protections afforded to them by law, potentially rendering the guarantee unconscionable or unenforceable under state law.",

Franchisor shall not be obligated to proceed against Master Franchisee or exhaust any security from Master Franchisee or pursue or exhaust any remedy, including any legal or equitable relief against Master Franchisee, before proceeding to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee, and the enforcement of such obligations may take place before, after, or contemporaneously with, enforcement of any debt or obligation of Master Franchisee under the Master Franchise Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Franchisor may enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee without any obligation to proceed against or exhaust any remedy against Master Franchisee, and such enforcement may occur at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original clause permits the Franchisor to pursue the Guarantors without first pursuing the Master Franchisee or their assets, but it doesn't explicitly preclude the Guarantors from requiring the Franchisor to do so. The changed clause eliminates any implication that the Guarantors could demand the Franchisor first pursue the Master Franchisee. While a guarantor can generally waive the right to require the creditor to proceed first against the primary debtor, some states impose limitations, particularly if the guarantor demonstrates that the primary debtor has assets sufficient to satisfy the debt and that pursuing the primary debtor first would significantly mitigate the guarantor's liability. The modified language removes any vestige of such a right, potentially violating laws designed to prevent creditors from unfairly targeting guarantors when other viable options exist. This can increase the legal risk of unconscionability claims.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Surgical and its employees shall conduct all activities under this Agreement or relating to the Product in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and all quality standards, protocols and systems established by Imprimis from time to time therefor.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'all applicable laws and regulations,' the contract no longer explicitly mandates compliance with relevant laws. This creates a legal risk, particularly concerning pharmaceutical sales and marketing, where strict regulations govern promotional activities. This omission could lead to violations of FDA regulations or anti-kickback statutes, for example.",

                "changed_text": "Each party shall maintain insurance with respect to its activities under this Agreement in such amounts and with such limits as deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirements for 'comprehensive or commercial general liability and products liability insurance' and the specific minimum coverage amounts weakens the insurance obligations. State laws often mandate minimum insurance coverage for businesses, particularly those involved in sales and marketing where potential liabilities are significant. This omission creates a contradiction, increasing legal risk.",

This is a critical omission as it pertains to laws directly affecting pharmaceutical sales and marketing, and could lead to legal repercussions if the team is not actually compliant with those laws.",

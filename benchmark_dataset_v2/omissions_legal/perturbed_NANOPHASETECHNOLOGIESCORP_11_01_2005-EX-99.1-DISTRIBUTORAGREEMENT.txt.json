Subject to the protocol described below, ALFA AESAR shall have the right to return at NTC's expense, and for full credit of ALFA AESAR's cost, any Products (i.) for which a legitimate and credible allegation is made that the use of such Products infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy or publicity, or any other tangible or intangible proprietary or intellectual property right; (b) that are not manufactured, packaged, or labeled in accordance with specifications or industry standards; (c) that are shipped in error or in non-conformance with ALFA AESAR's purchase order; or (d) that are damaged or defective. In the event that ALFA AESAR believes that it is entitled to return any Products delivered under this Agreement, the parties will adhere to the following protocol: (w) ALFA AESAR will contact NTC's Quality Director and then forward to the Quality Director, via a carrier selected by and at NTC's expense, a sample of the Product that ALFA AESAR believes is non-conforming; (x) upon receipt of the sample, NTC will test it and then notify ALFA AESAR of the test results; (y) where the test results confirm that the sample is non-conforming, NTC will provide ALFA AESAR with NTC's Return Authorization Number (\"RAN\"); and (z) any returned non-conforming Product must be in its original container, with original labels in act, and all paperwork concerning the returned Product must include NTC's RAN.",

ALFA AESAR may request to return Products at its own expense, subject to NTC's approval, for Products (i.) that are not manufactured, packaged, or labeled in accordance with specifications.

                "explanation": "The modified text significantly restricts ALFA AESAR's return rights. By removing the automatic right to return products at NTC's expense for reasons such as patent infringement, shipping errors, or defects, and instead making returns subject to NTC's approval, the contract now contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially applicable consumer protection laws, particularly regarding defective or non-conforming goods. In Illinois, the implied warranty of merchantability under the UCC provides certain return rights that this modification potentially undermines.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'NTC shall further grant to ALFA AESAR the same warranty, as set forth in NTC's General Terms and Conditions of Sale for its products set forth in Schedule B,' NTC is avoiding to grant warranty as set forth for ALFA AESAR. This warranty omission weakens the distributor's position with its own customers. Illinois's UCC stipulates implied warranties, which may be superseded by the general terms, potentially leaving ALFA AESAR without recourse against NTC.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific requirement for 'comprehensive general liability' and the minimum coverage amount of '$2,000,000.00 U.S. dollars' creates ambiguity and reduces the protection afforded to each party. Without a defined minimum, the insurance coverage could be inadequate to cover potential liabilities, particularly in product liability cases. This omission introduces legal risk, as standard commercial leases and distribution agreements often require specific coverage levels to protect against foreseeable risks. Under Illinois law, the absence of a clearly defined insurance obligation may lead to disputes and inadequate compensation in case of significant damages.",

                "changed_text": "PSS may choose to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Availability of public information under Rule 145(d) is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "This removes the explicit obligation for PSS to file reports, which is crucial for the affiliate to be able to sell shares under Rule 145(d) of the Securities Exchange Act. By making this discretionary, the contract weakens the affiliate's ability to utilize Rule 145(d) for transferring shares, creating a potential violation of securities laws if the affiliate is unduly restricted from selling their shares due to PSS not providing required information.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that Rules 144 and 145 are amended to eliminate restrictions, PSS may consider reissuing certificates without restrictive legends at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "This removes the obligation for PSS to reissue certificates without restrictive legends when amendments to Rules 144 and 145 eliminate restrictions, or upon expiration of the Rule 145(d) restrictive period. By making the reissuance discretionary, the contract potentially hinders the affiliate's ability to freely transfer shares even when legally permissible, introducing a violation of securities regulations related to the transfer of securities.",

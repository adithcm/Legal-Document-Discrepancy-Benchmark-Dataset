                "original_text": "The undersigned understands that PSS is under no ------------------------------------------------ obligation to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the --------------------------------------------------------------------- disposition of the undersigned's shares of PSS Common ----------------------------------------------------- Stock or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an ---------------------------------------------------------------------- exemption from such registration available.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned understands that PSS is under no obligation to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the disposition of the undersigned's shares of PSS Common Stock.",
                "explanation": "This omission removes the explicit statement that PSS has no obligation to take action to facilitate compliance with an exemption from registration. While seemingly minor, this could be interpreted to mean PSS has absolutely no responsibility in assisting shareholders with legally selling their shares, violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law, which requires companies to act in a way that doesn't deprive shareholders of the benefits of the agreement. It creates ambiguity on whether the company will assist shareholders at all, increasing the legal risk.",

                "changed_text": "In addition, if the provisions of Rules 144 and 145 are amended to eliminate restrictions applicable to the PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger, PSS may, at its discretion, consider reissuing the certificates representing the shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens PSS's obligation to remove restrictive legends. The original text mandates reissuance upon rule changes or expiration of the restrictive period, given an opinion from counsel. The modified text makes it discretionary, removing a key protection for shareholders. Delaware law requires companies to act reasonably when dealing with shareholder rights, and this change introduces potential breaches by allowing PSS to arbitrarily refuse to remove legends even when legally permissible, thus obstructing the shareholder's ability to freely transfer their shares.",

                "changed_text": "PSS agrees, for a period of one year after the effective date of the Merger, to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "The original clause ensures PSS files reports for three years, allowing shareholders to use Rule 145(d) for transfers. The change reduces this to one year and removes the explicit purpose of aiding shareholders' transfers. Under Delaware law, actions that significantly impair shareholder rights, such as limiting the timeframe where they can use standard SEC rules to sell their shares is generally prohibited, especially if not appropriately justified. This increases legal risk by potentially violating shareholder rights under Delaware Corporate Law regarding fair dealing.",

This PIP does not necessarily include any work that may be required for compliance with Title 111 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). lit addition, if a Franchise Agreement or a Management Agreement for a hotel constructed for first occupancy after January 26th 1993 is executed after March 30th 2011 Hilton Worldwide will require the owmrr to conduct a self-survey (provided by Hilton Worldwide) of the hotel's guestrooms and parting for compliance with ADA Title III requirements. Any areas of non-compliance will need to be addressed within five to seven years (dependi on the item in question) as a condition of the franchise or management agreeMent.",
                "changed_text": "Hotels should endeavor to comply with accessibility recommendations. This PIP does not include any work that may be required for accessibility standards. Hilton Worldwide may suggest a self-survey of the hotel's guestrooms and parking areas. Areas of non-compliance may be addressed at the ownerâ€™s discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'must comply' to 'should endeavor to comply,' the mandatory nature of ADA compliance is weakened. Removing the specific mention of ADA Title III and replacing the requirement to address non-compliance areas with optional actions significantly reduces the franchisee's legal obligations.  This creates a legal loophole regarding adherence to federal law. By removing the requirement to address non-compliance issues within 5-7 years, it introduces significant legal risks related to accessibility standards and disability rights.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'or policy limits' weakens the requirement to maintain adequate insurance coverage. By deleting \"policy limits required...\" the franchisee can obtain only the bare minimum insurance, potentially leaving the franchisor exposed to uncovered damages. This clause violates standards that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial leases.",

                "explanation": "By stating that liquidated damages are the 'sole and exclusive remedy,' the franchisor waives its right to seek actual damages even in situations where liquidated damages are insufficient.  This omission can contradict the legal principle that parties are entitled to be fully compensated for actual losses suffered due to breach of contract. It is weakening the possibility for the franchisor to seek actual damages from the franchisee, even with proof of greater actual damages.",

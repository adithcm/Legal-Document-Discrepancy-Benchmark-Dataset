                "explanation": "The clause 'NOTHING IN THIS SECTION LIMITS OUR RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED AGAINST THE PAYMENT OF PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY' has been removed. It limits the waiver of punitive damages by ensuring the indemnified party can still seek indemnity against payment of such damages to a third party. Its omission may violate general principles of indemnity law that seek to make an injured party whole, thereby creating a legal risk. Without this clause, the franchisee might argue that because they've waived punitive damages, they're also not liable for indemnifying the franchisor against punitive damages awarded to a third party, regardless of the origin of the claim.",

This has been weakened by excluding the reference to the non-prevailing party reimbursing for court costs and all other expenses, which may cause non-compliance with some jurisdiction's franchise laws regarding dispute resolution and cost allocation.",

You may not rely on this exception to your indemnity obligation if the claims were asserted against us or any other Indemnified Party on the basis of theories of imputed or secondary liability, such as vicarious liability, agency, or apparent agency, or our failure to compel you to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, including compliance with Standards, Laws or other requirements.",

This sentence provided the Franchisor broader coverage under the indemnity obligations.

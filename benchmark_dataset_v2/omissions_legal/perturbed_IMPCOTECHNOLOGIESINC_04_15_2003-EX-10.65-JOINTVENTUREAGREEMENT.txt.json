                "original_text": "Subject to the approval of the Government of India (`GOI'), Reserve Bank of India (`RBI') and other Government agencies, if any, the shares in the JVC shall be issued to the Parties in the following percentage of the total paid-up capital of the JVC. MIL, MINDA and its associates - 40% - In cash and /or in Kind.

IMPCO - 60% - In cash In consideration thereof, the JVC will issue equity shares either at par or at premium as mutually agreed by the Parties.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the clause 'Subject to the approval of the Government of India (`GOI'), Reserve Bank of India (`RBI') and other Government agencies, if any,' eliminates the condition precedent of regulatory approval for the share issuance. This omission could lead to legal complications if the share issuance proceeds without the necessary governmental approvals, potentially violating Indian company law and foreign investment regulations.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'execute all necessary documents, including consents and no-objection certificates to the Government of India', the contract weakens the obligation to actively assist in obtaining governmental approvals. This is a violation because the prior text ensures fulfillment of the obligations",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'the Delhi Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction' and the clause waiving challenges to that jurisdiction weakens the enforceability of the contract. This introduces a potential legal contradiction if other jurisdictions are sought, which could violate the civil procedure code",

                "explanation": "This change omits the requirement to adhere to the Companies Act, 1956, and other applicable laws, potentially leading to non-compliance and legal issues. The original text ensures compliance with Indian accounting standards and laws, while the modified version removes this obligation.",

The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted at London, United Kingdom, in the English language.",

                "explanation": "This modification allows IMPCO to unilaterally determine the location and language of arbitration, potentially creating unfair conditions and undermining the principles of fair dispute resolution. Arbitration law generally requires mutual agreement on the arbitration process.",

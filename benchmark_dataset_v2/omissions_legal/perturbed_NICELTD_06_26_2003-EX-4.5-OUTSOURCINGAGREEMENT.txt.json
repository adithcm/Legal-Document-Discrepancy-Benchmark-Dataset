                "original_text": "Contractor shall maintain, and shall cause any subcontractors engaged by Contractor to provide services under this Agreement to maintain, at Contractor's own expense, as long as this Agreement is in effect, insurance policies of the kind and limits as set forth in APPENDIX D to this Agreement. The expense of such insurance shall be borne by Contractor. The Contractor shall keep in force the policies specified in sections 1 and 3 to the Insurance Certificate valid as long as Contractor's legal liability EXISTS IN CONNECTION WITH OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor shall maintain insurance policies as generally deemed appropriate. The expense of such insurance shall be borne by Contractor.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific insurance policies as per Appendix D, ensuring coverage throughout the agreement's term. The modified version weakens this requirement by removing the reference to specific policies and limits, and eliminating the requirement to maintain coverage as long as legal liability exists. This omission can create a legal loophole if Contractor obtains inadequate insurance, potentially violating Israeli law which requires businesses to maintain adequate insurance coverage for their operations and liabilities.",

                "changed_text": "Contractor may be liable for the loss of or damage to components and/or the Products while in Contractor's possession.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly establishes Contractor's liability for loss or damage to NICE's components and products while in their possession, up to the point of delivery to NICE's freight forwarder. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using 'may be liable,' which weakens the obligation. Under Israeli law, bailees (those holding goods belonging to another) have a duty of care. This weakened clause potentially contradicts that obligation by creating uncertainty about liability, thus creating a legal loophole for the contractor to avoid responsibility for negligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Israeli law of obligations and bailment, specifically relating to duty of care for bailed goods.",

Certificates of Insurance shall be kept current throughout the entire term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Contractor may provide NICE with certificates of insurance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires the Contractor to provide proof of insurance coverage within 10 days of the contract's execution and to maintain current certificates throughout the agreement's duration. This ensures NICE can verify adequate coverage. The modified version makes providing certificates optional ('may provide'), removing NICE's ability to readily confirm compliance with insurance requirements. This creates a risk and potential violation of standard business practices and regulatory expectations in Israel, where demonstrating insurance coverage is often a requirement for ongoing operations.",

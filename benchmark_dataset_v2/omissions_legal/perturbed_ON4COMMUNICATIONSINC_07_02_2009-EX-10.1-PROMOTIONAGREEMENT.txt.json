                "original_text": "Charity Tunes warrants that, subject only to any limitation or condition specified in this Agreement, it will provide  immediately to any consumer entitled to a music download in connection with a Pin Code the music download selected by that consumer.",
                "changed_text": "Charity Tunes will attempt to provide a music download to any consumer entitled to a music download in connection with a Pin Code the music download selected by that consumer.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'warrants that it will provide immediately' to 'will attempt to provide', the contract weakens the guarantee of service. Canadian consumer protection laws, specifically the Competition Act, require that promotions be honoured as advertised. Suggesting only an attempt, rather than a guarantee, introduces a legal risk.",

                "original_text": "If for any reason Charity Tunes fails to provide a music download to a consumer in  accordance with clause 11.1, thereby breaching its warranty thereunder, it shall: (i) forthwith remedy that failure by providing  the requested download to that consumer as soon as possible; (ii) forthwith provide notice to Sponsor of the failure to  immediately provide the download, including the date, time and other details of the failure, and of the steps being taken  forthwith to remedy the failure; and (iii) once the failure has been remedied by Charity Tunes, forthwith provide Sponsor with  notice of same.",
                "changed_text": "If Charity Tunes fails to provide a music download to a consumer, it may attempt to remedy the failure. Notice to Sponsor is not required.",
                "explanation": "This removes the obligation to remedy the failure to provide the download and removes the requirement to notify the sponsor. This introduces ambiguity and removes the consumer's recourse to get their promised download and weakens the sponsorâ€™s tracking capability. This can violate consumer protection laws in Canada that require reasonable remedies for failed promotions.",

                "changed_text": "The parties agree that any disputes arising from this agreement will be resolved through binding arbitration.",
                "explanation": "By changing the jurisdiction to binding arbitration, the contract removes the consumer's right to pursue legal action in court. While arbitration is generally permissible, making it *exclusively* the only avenue for dispute resolution may violate consumer protection laws in Canada that ensure access to courts, especially when the imbalance of power favors the corporation. This limits legal recourse for consumers, potentially breaching fairness provisions in consumer law.",

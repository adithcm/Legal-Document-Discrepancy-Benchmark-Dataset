                "explanation": "The removal of the explicit warranty period of ninety (90) days and the specification of replacement within sixty (60) days significantly weakens the warranty provided. Furthermore, removing 'INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE' limits consumer rights. The change from 'must be replaced' to 'may be considered' introduces ambiguity and discretion, undermining the consumer's right to a guaranteed remedy within a defined timeframe. This weakens the implied warranty of merchantability, potentially violating consumer protection laws in Texas that require goods to be fit for their intended purpose.",

In case any Product, or any part thereof, if such suit is held to constitute an infringement and the use of said Product or part is enjoined, Company shall, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, either procure for the indemnitee the right to continue using said Product or provide or procure for the Distributor a similar product.",

                "explanation": "The removal of \"at its own expense\", \"(including attorneys' fees incurred)\", \"promptly\" and \"full and proper\", and \"at Company's expense\" weakens the indemnification clause. Company no longer agrees to pay for the distributor's expenses or be notified promptly of such claim. The omission of the phrase 'full and proper' and 'at Company's expense' regarding information and assistance dilutes the company's responsibility in providing adequate support for the defense against infringement claims. This creates a legal risk as Texas law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing, and this modification could be seen as breaching that duty by shifting costs and weakening support during a legal challenge.",

Nor shall the Company at any time be liable for any incidental, special or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"causes beyond the control of the Company\" to \"causes determined by the Company\" provides the company with unilateral power to determine what constitutes a force majeure event, shifting the risk unfairly to the distributor. This introduces a legal risk because it could be viewed as an unconscionable clause or a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Texas law, especially if the company uses this clause to avoid obligations for reasons that are not truly beyond their control.",

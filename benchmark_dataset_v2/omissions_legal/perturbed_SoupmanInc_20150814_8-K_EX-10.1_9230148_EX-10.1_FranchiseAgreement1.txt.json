                "changed_text": "You shall obtain permits, certificates, or licenses necessary for the operation of the Franchised Business.",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'timely' and the specific examples, the contract fails to emphasize the franchisee's responsibility to adhere to deadlines and specific legal requirements, potentially leading to non-compliance with various state and local regulations. This creates a legal risk because many jurisdictions impose strict deadlines for obtaining business licenses and permits. Removing these details weakens the enforceability of the clause and increases the likelihood of legal disputes arising from delays or omissions.",

You must maintain insurance related to your operation of the Franchised Business. Such insurance coverage will include:\n\n5.5.1 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: broad form comprehensive general liability coverage against claims for employment practices coverage, bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the conduct of business by you pursuant to this Agreement and broad form contractual liability coverage, including errors and omissions coverage, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage prescribed by us from time to time, but in no event in an amount less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate. Such insurance shall not have a deductible or self-insured retention in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000);\n\n5.5.2 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: automobile liability insurance coverage, including owned and non-owned vehicles, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence;\n\n5.5.3 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance in statutory amounts, unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as required by governing law for your employees;",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies types and amounts of required insurance, which indirectly protects employees and customers. The modified text omits these requirements. This omission introduces legal risk because it potentially violates state laws that mandate specific insurance coverage for businesses, such as worker's compensation and minimum liability coverage. By removing the specifics, the contract allows for insufficient insurance coverage, exposing the franchisee and franchisor to legal liability in case of accidents or injuries.",

                "changed_text": "You acknowledge that you have received a copy of our FDD for Master Franchised Businesses.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states the franchisee received the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) at least 14 days before signing the agreement or making any payments. This is a crucial protection mandated by the FTC Franchise Rule. Omitting the '14 calendar days' removes this protection, creating a legal contradiction because the franchisee might not have had sufficient time to review the document, potentially voiding the agreement. This creates a legal risk for the franchisor as it violates federal law regarding franchise sales.",

Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement detailing the amount of applicable gross revenue received, the calculation of the amount due to the other party and the amount of the payment accompanying such statement. All payments due to either party hereunder shall be made in immediately available U.S. funds, without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as applicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other authority.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for or grossed up for, as applicable), any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any governmental taxing or other authority' removes a legal protection for one party. This creates a situation where one party could potentially be liable for taxes or other charges that should rightfully be borne by the other party according to standard legal and accounting practices. This could potentially violate tax laws.",

PaperExchange shall then have three business days after receipt of such notice to (a) accept or reject such advertiser, in its reasonable business discretion, and (b) notify VerticalNet of its decision. If, at the end of such three-day period, PaperExchange has not responded to such notice, PaperExchange shall be deemed to have accepted such advertiser. PaperExchange shall then work with the advertiser to facilitate the Placement of the advertisement and maintain such advertisement on the agreed-upon page of the PaperExchange Site. PaperExchange shall have the right to terminate its agreement with any such advertiser in its reasonable business discretion. To the extent an advertisement of equivalent size and location appears on both Pulp and Paper Online and the PaperExchange Site, the parties shall mutually agree upon the CPM, CPC or other use-based advertising rates, which rate shall be identical for such advertisements. PaperExchange shall be responsible for, and shall have sole control of, all credit, billing and collection with the advertisements on the PaperExchange Site. VerticalNet shall have no authority to make collections on behalf of PaperExchange.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause related to the Director of Online Marketing's role and the three-day acceptance/rejection period, PaperExchange loses critical oversight and control over advertisements placed on its site.

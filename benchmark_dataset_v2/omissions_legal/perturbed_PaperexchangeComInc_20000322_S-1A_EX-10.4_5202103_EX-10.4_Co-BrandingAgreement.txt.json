During the 18-month period following the payment by one party of any amount due under this Agreement to the other party, the party receiving Source: PAPEREXCHANGE COM INC, S-1/A, 3/22/2000 payment (the \"Auditing Party\") shall have the right to have an independent third party (the \"Auditor\") audit the financial records of the other party (the \"Audited Party\") relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of the Audited Party's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid. The Auditing Party may cause the Auditor to perform such an audit not more than once in any 12-month period, unless a prior audit within the past two years revealed that the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid in excess of 5% of the amount owed, in which case an audit may be performed no more frequently than once in any three month period. If the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid, the Audited Party shall pay the additional amount owed and all accrued interest thereon to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to the Audited Party. If the amount owed by' the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such to the Audited Party. If the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was overpaid, the Auditing Party shall return the excess amount paid to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to the Auditing Party. The Auditing Party shall give reasonable advance written notice to the Audited Party, and each audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by the Audited Party.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the right of a party to audit the other's financial records to verify payment accuracy, a standard protection in commercial agreements. By making the audit discretionary and not a right, it weakens the ability to ensure financial transparency, potentially violating accounting regulations in Pennsylvania or Delaware where the involved companies are registered. In many states, including Pennsylvania, laws require businesses to maintain accurate financial records, and this provision could hinder the process of verifying compliance. The original text provided a structured approach to audits that ensures compliance and financial transparency. Removing it introduces potential legal and financial risks.",

PaperExchange shall indemnify and hold harmless VerticalNet and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, judgments, awards, costs, expenses and disbursements, including without limitation, the costs, expenses and disbursements, as and when incurred, of investigating, preparing or defending any action, suit, proceeding or investigation asserted by a third party, caused by, relating to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with (a) any breach by PaperExchange of the representations, warranties or agreements made by it under this Agreement, (b) negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct on the part of PaperExchange or its officers, directors, employees, agents or consultants, (c) any claim that the PaperExchange Content infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights or any other right of any third party or (d) the promotion, advertisement or marketing of the VerticalNet Content or VerticalNet Archived Content by or on behalf of PaperExchange.",

                "explanation": "This significantly reduces PaperExchange's indemnification obligations. It limits indemnification to only gross negligence and caps the liability at $10,000, removing coverage for breaches of contract, intellectual property infringements, and negligence related to marketing. This introduces a legal contradiction with standard commercial law practices in Pennsylvania, which generally hold parties accountable for breaches of contract and negligence, subject to reasonable limitations. The extremely low cap and narrow scope could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing, creating legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the obligation to 'obtain all necessary approvals, consents and permits required by the applicable agencies of the government of the jurisdictions that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement' and replacing 'comply' with 'endeavor to comply' significantly weakens the commitment to legal compliance. This could create legal risks if a party fails to obtain required permits or approvals. In both Pennsylvania and Delaware, operating without required permits can result in fines and legal action. The modification introduces a legal contradiction by removing an explicit requirement for obtaining necessary legal authorizations, which is a fundamental aspect of responsible business conduct.",

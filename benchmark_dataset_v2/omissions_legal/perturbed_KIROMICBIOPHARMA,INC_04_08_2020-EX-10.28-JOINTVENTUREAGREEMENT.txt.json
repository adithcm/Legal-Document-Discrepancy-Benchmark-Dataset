                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'Each of the parties to this Agreement consents to personal jurisdiction for any emergency injunction sought in the Court of Rome' the agreement removes the consent to personal jurisdiction for emergency injunctions in the Court of Rome. Italy, as part of the EU, adheres to Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012, which governs jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Although parties can agree on jurisdiction, removing the consent to the court of Rome introduces ambiguity and potential conflict with Italian law regarding provisional measures. The agreement becomes less compliant and introduces legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Anti-Corruption' and replacing with just 'rules', and also removing the sentence 'Kiromic acknowledges receipt of a copy of MOLIPHARMA's Anti-Corruption Policies and confirms that it has Anti-Corruption Policies in place that are at least comparable to MOLIPHARMA's', the clarity regarding adherence to anti-corruption measures is significantly reduced. This creates a **legal contradiction** because Kiromic (a Delaware company) is required to adhere to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Molipharma must follow Italian anti-corruption laws. This vagueness introduces legal risk.",

This could lead to issues concerning trade secrets and proprietary information. In many jurisdictions, including both Delaware (Kiromic) and Italy (Molipharma), there are laws protecting trade secrets. Diluting the requirement to actively enforce confidentiality introduces a legal risk and makes the agreement less compliant with trade secret laws.",

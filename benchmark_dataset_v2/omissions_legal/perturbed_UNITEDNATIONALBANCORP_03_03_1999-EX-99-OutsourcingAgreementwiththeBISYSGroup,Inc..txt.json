                "explanation": "By removing the sentence \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our information processing needs going forward into the next century,\" we omit information about the due diligence process. Although this might seem minor, depending on the services BISYS is providing (e.g., handling customer data), regulations like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in the United States require financial institutions to conduct thorough risk assessments and due diligence when outsourcing critical functions. Omitting this statement could imply a lack of due diligence, creating regulatory risk.",

                "original_text": "Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies *exclusive* jurisdiction and contains a waiver of objecting to jurisdiction. The modified text removes the term 'irrevocably' and 'exclusive' as well as the waiver of jurisdictional objections, effectively allowing a party to challenge jurisdiction, which may violate requirements for mandatory and binding arbitration clauses established by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and Delaware law regarding dispute resolution.",

THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS.",
                "changed_text": "Each party agrees that any claims or causes of action relating to this agreement will be resolved by a judge.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit waiver of a jury trial and replacing it with a clause indicating resolution by a judge, the modification weakens the enforceability of the jury trial waiver. This weakens the clear and conspicuous nature of the waiver, potentially violating Delaware law which requires knowing and voluntary waivers of constitutional rights.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the affected Party shall have the right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief of its rights under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy are waived.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the affected Party shall have the right to seek remedies at law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides for specific performance and injunctive relief, preventing the argument that monetary damages are sufficient. The modification removes the right to specific performance/injunctive relief, and implicitly removes the waiver of opposing such relief. The omission weakens the ability to enforce the contract and may violate general principles of contract law that aim to provide adequate remedies for breach. Also, the bond waiver clause is omitted, which might violate the need for a bond in seeking equitable relief.",

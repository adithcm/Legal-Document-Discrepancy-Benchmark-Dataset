                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Distribution Date, Nuance hereby grants to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g)) license under the Nuance Patents, solely to the extent that claims of the Nuance Patents cover products or services of the SpinCo Business in the SpinCo Field of Use, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit such products and services, together with natural extensions and evolutions thereof.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'perpetual and irrevocable, transferable (subject to ARTICLE VIII), sublicensable (subject to Section 3.01(g))' significantly restricts SpinCo's rights, potentially hindering its ability to fully utilize the licensed patents. This creates uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the license, which could be interpreted as a violation of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under Delaware law (since the company is registered in Delaware), as it limits the intended use of the IP. The omission contradicts standard IP licensing practices and creates legal risk by making the license less valuable and more susceptible to challenges.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'applicable national and international laws' weakens the commitment to full legal compliance. By only referring to 'regulations' the parties could argue that they are only obliged to follow official administrative rules, while neglecting any relevant statutes or laws passed by a legislature. Since the agreement is governed by Delaware law, but addresses international aspects, omitting those legal references generates ambiguity and potential non-compliance with legal obligations. This is a legal contradiction and raises concerns for potential breaches of export control laws.",

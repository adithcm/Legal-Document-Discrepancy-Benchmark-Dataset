                "original_text": "16.  TIME OF THE ESSENCE. TPC acknowledges that time is of the essence in the payment of all compensation due Consolidated Artists hereunder. For the purposes of this Agreement, all payments not received within thirty (30) days of the date due shall be deemed \"past due\". Such past due payments shall bear interest at a rate of two percent (2%) per month OR the maximum rate permissible by law, whichever is less. The imposition of interest provided for in this Paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Consolidated Artists under this Agreement or otherwise. Accordingly, Consolidated Artists shall not be precluded from exercising any other remedies, whether at law or in equity, to enforce the terms of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the clause specifying interest on late payments and establishing a specific interest rate contradicts general contract law principles in Virginia (the governing law stated in section 28) that entitle the injured party to damages, which may include interest, in the event of a breach of contract. Omitting the interest clause could be viewed as an attempt to circumvent the legal requirement to compensate the non-breaching party fairly, specifically if statutory rates are higher than the contractual cap (now absent).",

TPC agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless Consolidated Artists and Ogle from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including attorneys' fees, arising out of, or in any way connected with, any claim or action which arises from the use of the Endorsed Product, the use of the Ogle Endorsement, or the performance of Consolidated Artists' and Ogle's obligations hereunder.",

                "explanation": "The removal of \"protect\" and \"whatsoever, including attorneys' fees\" from the indemnity clause weakens the protection afforded to Consolidated Artists and Ogle. Under Virginia law, indemnity clauses are generally enforceable, but specific wording can greatly impact their scope. Eliminating the commitment to 'protect' and the explicit mention of 'attorneys' fees' creates ambiguity and potential for disputes, as it could be argued that TPC is not obligated to cover legal costs incurred by Consolidated Artists or Ogle in defending against claims related to the endorsement agreement, even if those claims are ultimately unsuccessful or partially stem from TPC's actions. Virginia law requires clear and unambiguous language for indemnification of attorney's fees.",

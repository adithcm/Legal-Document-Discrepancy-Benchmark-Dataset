Shipper shall not Tender Product for transportation on the System unless the Product will be readily susceptible to transportation through the System, such Product will not adversely damage the Common Stream or the System, and such Product otherwise conforms to the specifications set forth in this Item No. 3.\n\n  B. As a prerequisite to transportation on the System, Shipper's Product must also conform to the quality specifications of the connectingcarrier or facility at the Nominated Delivery Point.\n\n\n\nC. Shipper shall perform applicable tests to ensure that the Product it Tenders to Carrier for delivery on the System conforms to the specifications set forth in this Item No. 3. Should spot samples, analyses, or any other test (including tests performed by Carrier) indicate that the Product Tendered or to be Tendered does not meet the specifications required by Carrier, Shipper agrees to stop delivery of such off-specification Product to Carrier until such time as it is determined by additional testing that the Product meets the definition of Product issued by Carrier.",

                "explanation": "By removing the obligation for products to conform to the specifications and changing 'shall' to 'may', the contract weakens the consumer's assurance that the product is of the required standard. It also removes the responsibility of the Shipper to test that their product meets Carrier specifications. Some regulations mandate that transported goods meet particular standards to ensure safety and prevent damage.",

All payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.\n\n\n\nC.

                "explanation": "The modification removes the payment terms that allow some flexibility for the Shipper to remit payment.

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to conform to Post Holding's Quality Expectations Manual (Schedule E) weakens product safety standards. If Schedule E contains requirements mandated by FDA regulations or other food safety laws, this omission creates a legal contradiction. This could lead to violations of consumer protection laws related to product safety and quality, depending on the contents of Schedule E and the jurisdiction where the products are sold (likely the United States, given the context).",

                "explanation": "Removing the sentence \"Heritage shall not, however, purchase ingredients or packaging materials in excess of those required [***].\" potentially removes a restriction on over-purchasing ingredients and packaging. If this restriction was intended to ensure compliance with regulations relating to waste management, ingredient traceability or restrictions on the use of certain ingredients enforced by the FDA, its removal could lead to regulatory non-compliance. This is because it opens the door to practices that might contravene these regulations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement to copy the General Counsel on notices could have legal ramifications. If California law (where Emeryville is located) requires specific legal notifications to be sent to a company's legal representation in contractual matters, omitting the 'copy to General Counsel' clause could create a compliance issue, especially if those notifications involve potential breaches of contract, safety issues, or other legal liabilities. This would hinder the General Counsel's awareness of crucial communications, increasing the likelihood of mishandling legal matters.",

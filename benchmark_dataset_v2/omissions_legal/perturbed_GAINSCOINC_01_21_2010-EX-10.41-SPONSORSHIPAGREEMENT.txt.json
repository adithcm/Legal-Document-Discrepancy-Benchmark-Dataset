                "original_text": "(a) Racing shall obtain and maintain, at Racing's expense, comprehensive automobile liability insurance covering all owned, non-owned and  hired vehicles used by Racing in the Business with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence combined single limit for personal injury and  property damage, including all statutory coverage for all states of operation. Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision  insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all  related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the  Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.",

Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all  related entities\" as additional insureds.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific minimum coverage limit ($5,000,000 per occurrence) and the requirement for 'comprehensive' coverage significantly weakens the insurance obligation. Also, the part regarding 'stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy' has been removed. This creates a legal risk as Texas law (where both parties are located) and standard business practices often require specific minimum liability coverage for commercial activities, especially in high-risk areas like auto racing.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the specific minimum liability limits for each type of insurance removes a crucial protection for the Sponsor. Without these limits, it is unclear what level of coverage Racing is required to maintain, which introduces significant financial risk for the Sponsor in case of an accident. This contradicts standard risk management practices and potentially violates implied duties of reasonable care under Texas law.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement that the certificate of insurance state that Racing's insurance is primary and that the Sponsor receives 30 days' notice of policy changes or cancellation, the contract omits critical protections for the Sponsor. This weakens the Sponsor's ability to rely on Racing's insurance in case of a claim and reduces the Sponsor's ability to mitigate risk. This is in contradiction with best business practices and may leave GAINSCO vulnerable.",

Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision insurance on each vehicle used in the Business. Racing shall provide the Sponsor a certificate of insurance evidencing \"Gainsco Inc. and all related entities\" as additional insureds, stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available the Sponsor, and providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of cancellation, modification or material change to the policy.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specific coverage limits, the requirement for 'comprehensive' coverage, the inclusion of 'fire and theft' insurance, and the stipulation for 30 days' notice of policy changes. Texas law and standard business practices often require specific minimum liability coverage amounts for businesses operating vehicles. Omitting these details creates a legal risk for the Sponsor as it weakens their protection in case of an accident. It also omits that the insurance should be primary to other insurances that may be available to the sponsor, and does not specify how long the insurance coverage should last.",

This introduces a legal risk because it weakens the Sponsor's protection. Without the minimum limits the sponsor has no security as to how protected they are in cases of liability and litigation.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for the certificate to 'evidence compliance with the insurance requirements set forth above', removes 'stating that such insurance is primary in coverage to any other insurance which may be available to the Sponsor' and eliminates the requirement of providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sponsor of termination, cancellation, modification or material change to the policy. By deleting the compliance clause the Sponsor has no guarantee that Racing will actually follow the insurance terms, and by not requiring the insurance to be primary the Sponsor may have to cover costs the Racing Team would typically be responsible for.

Such insurance (i) will be primary insurance with respect to each Party's own participation under this Agreement and (ii) will be issued by a recognized insurer rated by A.M. Best \"A-VII\" (or its equivalent) or better, or an insurer pre-approved in writing by the other Party.",

Best \"A-VII\" or equivalent), the clause weakens the security that the insurance provider is financially sound. This introduces legal risk because it omits a prudent business practice expectation, contradicting general standards of due diligence.",

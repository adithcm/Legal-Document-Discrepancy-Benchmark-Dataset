                "original_text": "7.1 Performance Warranty. Todos warrants that for a period of one (1) year from the date of delivery of each Product to the Reseller, the Product, except for those components that have a shorter expiration date as set forth on Exhibit A, shall perform substantially in accordance with the Product's documentation and specifications, and shall be free from all defects in materials, manufacture, and workmanship. Todos shall correct or repair any reported non-conformity or defect, or replace the non-conforming Product with a Product that conforms to this warranty.",

Todos warrants that the Product, except for those components that have a shorter expiration date as set forth on Exhibit A, shall perform substantially in accordance with the Product's documentation and specifications. Todos may choose to correct or repair any reported non-conformity or defect at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the one-year warranty period and the mandatory obligation to correct defects or replace non-conforming products, the contract becomes less compliant with Israeli consumer protection laws. Israeli law generally implies warranties of merchantability and fitness for purpose, and significantly limiting these without clear and conspicuous waiver could be problematic. The changes also make the warranty vague and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS SECTION 7,' the disclaimer now attempts to eliminate ALL warranties, even the express one provided in 7.1. Israeli law restricts the ability to completely disclaim all warranties, especially implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose when selling goods. This creates a legal contradiction and significantly increases risk for Todos.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates compliance with 21 CFR 803, which are the FDA's medical device reporting regulations. While the agreement is between two Israeli companies and the products are being sold in Israel, the FDA regulations may still apply if the product is intended for export to the US or if there is any US involvement in its development or manufacturing. Changing 'shall' to 'may' removes the mandatory reporting obligation, which violates the FDA regulations if they are applicable, and also potentially violates Israeli regulations regarding product safety reporting.",

The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free\" from the license grant, this introduces a legal contradiction. Intellectual property licenses, especially in the context of a corporate separation, require clear terms regarding the duration and payment structure. Removing these terms introduces ambiguity and potentially violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which exists under Delaware law (where both companies are incorporated). A license lacking clearly defined duration and payment can be challenged as unenforceable or subject to unintended interpretations. This omission creates a legal risk.",

The original clause provides certainty about the nature and duration of the license, protecting SpinCo's ability to utilize the licensed IP. The absence of these terms can be interpreted as creating a license that could be revoked, requires ongoing royalty payments, or is limited in duration.

Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code specifically protects licensees of intellectual property in bankruptcy proceedings. Deleting this explicit reference weakens Parent's position and creates a contradiction, increasing legal risk for Parent should SpinCo declare bankruptcy.",

Such license shall be transferrable subject to the foregoing restriction with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business that utilizes such Intellectual Property, but, for the avoidance of doubt, such license shall not otherwise be sublicensable or transferable. Any transfer by SpinCo or a member of its Group shall require the transferee to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the transferred Intellectual Property in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further transfer of rights by such party or any use of the transferred Intellectual Property outside the scope of the license granted to SpinCo herein. If SpinCo enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this  Section 3.2  in connection with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business, then Parent and members of the Parent Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right' from the Parent's grant to SpinCo, the agreement omits critical components that guarantee SpinCo's long-term and unrestricted use of licensed intellectual property. This omission introduces a legal risk, as it weakens SpinCo's rights and creates uncertainty about the duration and scope of the license, potentially leading to disputes and hindering SpinCo's business operations. Delaware law respects contractual agreements regarding intellectual property rights, and altering key terms can lead to future legal challenges regarding the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement, especially concerning the implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain' to 'may attempt to obtain' and 'shall be solely responsible' to 'may be solely responsible,' the contract weakens the obligation for Parent and SpinCo to actively pursue the transfer of IP liabilities. This introduces a legal risk by creating ambiguity about the commitment to novate or assign liabilities, potentially leading to disputes over responsibility for SpinCo IP Liabilities. Delaware law requires clear and definite contractual terms, and weakening these obligations can open the door for legal challenges based on the interpretation of intent and enforceability of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will deliver' to 'may deliver' and omitting 'without retaining any copies', the contract allows either party to optionally transfer tangible or intangible information, and to retain copies when doing so. This creates legal risk by clouding the obligation to transfer crucial information post-separation and allowing for potentially conflicting use of information. Delaware law enforces contractual obligations, and this modification weakens the commitment to information transfer, potentially leading to disputes over compliance with the agreement and the integrity of intellectual property rights.",

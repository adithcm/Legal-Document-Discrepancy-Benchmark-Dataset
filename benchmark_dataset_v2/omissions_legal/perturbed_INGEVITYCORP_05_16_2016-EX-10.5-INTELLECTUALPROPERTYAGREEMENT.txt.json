The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free' significantly limits the license granted to Parent. This creates a legal risk because without those terms, the license could be interpreted as revocable or requiring ongoing payments, contradicting standard business practices and potentially violating implicit agreements between the parties. Omitting 'irrevocable' introduces the risk of SpinCo revoking the license.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the prior modification, the removal of 'perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free' from the license granted to SpinCo introduces the same legal contradictions. This weakens SpinCo's rights, making the license potentially revocable or subject to ongoing payments, which could conflict with the intended nature of the agreement and industry standards.

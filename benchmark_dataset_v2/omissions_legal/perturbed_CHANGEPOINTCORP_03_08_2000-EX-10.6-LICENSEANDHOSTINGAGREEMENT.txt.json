                "explanation": "The original text explicitly protects Changepoint's intellectual property rights. The modified text removes the phrase 'including, without limitation, the Intellectual Property Rights therein,' weakening Changepoint's protection of its IP, creating a legal contradiction because intellectual property rights are legally protected and enforceable. This weakens the protection of Changepoint's intellectual property, potentially violating intellectual property laws.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes critical limitations from Changepoint's indemnification obligations.  The original text limited indemnification to infringements 'enforceable in the United States of America', this is removed. The original required 'a court of competent jurisdiction by final order from which no appeal is taken or the time for appealing has expired,' creating a stricter criteria, which is now gone. The removal of 'at its option) settle' forces Changepoint to defend every claim which is not a realistic practice. These omissions create a legal contradiction with standard practices regarding the scope and limitations of indemnification clauses.",

Customer hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for any legal action arising out of this Agreement or the performance of the obligations hereunder or thereunder. This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in the State of New York, and Customer agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding against Changepoint or any affiliate of Changepoint or any of their employees, officers or directors in any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law as governing and provides for non-exclusive jurisdiction in New York courts. The modified clause allows Changepoint to unilaterally determine the governing law and jurisdiction, restricting Customer's ability to seek legal remedies in a fair and predictable forum. The addition of 'without Changepoint's approval' is a blatant violation of civil procedure, where all people have the right to sue in court. This creates a legal contradiction with fundamental principles of due process and fairness in legal proceedings, particularly if Changepoint chooses a jurisdiction unfavorable to the Customer.",

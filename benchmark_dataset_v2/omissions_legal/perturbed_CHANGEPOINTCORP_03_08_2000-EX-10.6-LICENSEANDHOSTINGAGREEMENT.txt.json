Customer hereby submits to the non-exclusive                       jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for                       any legal action arising out of this Agreement or the                       performance of the obligations hereunder or thereunder.",

Customer hereby submits to the agreed-upon jurisdiction for any legal action arising out of this Agreement or the performance of the obligations hereunder or thereunder.",

Without a specified jurisdiction, consumers may face difficulties enforcing their rights, potentially violating state laws designed to protect consumers in transactions. The new language makes the terms and enforcement jurisdiction unclear and negotiable, which creates legal risk.",

However, such warranty does not apply to any failures to process date data that result from any software other than the Licensed Software or hardware or which relate to accepting data from any system not supplied by Changepoint. For greater clarity the Y2K Warranty shall only apply if Customer uses the Software in accordance with the Documentation.\n\n(c)      Customer's exclusive remedy and Changepoint's sole obligation with respect to the breach of any of the foregoing warranties is for Changepoint to (i) make commercially reasonable efforts to correct or provide Customer with a workaround for the failure of the Licensed Software to conform substantially to the description thereof in the Documentation or to comply with the Y2K Warranty, as the case may be, or, at Changepoint's sole option, provide Customer with a refund for the License Fees paid with respect to such Licensed Software, and (ii) provide Customer with replacement media in the event there are defects in materials or workmanship in the media upon which the Licensed Software and Documentation are provided if the media is returned to Changepoint within the Warranty Period.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the specific warranties, including the \"Y2K Warranty,\" and replaces them with vague statements. This eliminates legally required assurances about the software's functionality and compliance, introducing a legal contradiction with consumer protection laws requiring minimum product quality guarantees. The new language makes it difficult for the customer to seek legal recourse if the software fails to perform as expected, and fails to process date data correctly.",

                "explanation": "The original section provides specific limitations on Changepoint's liability. The modified section removes these specific limits and provides that Changepoint's liability is discretionary, essentially eliminating any meaningful avenue for Customer to seek damages. The deletion introduces a legal contradiction since state laws generally do not allow complete waivers of liability, especially for negligence or willful misconduct. This creates a risk for Changepoint, as such broad waivers may be unenforceable.",

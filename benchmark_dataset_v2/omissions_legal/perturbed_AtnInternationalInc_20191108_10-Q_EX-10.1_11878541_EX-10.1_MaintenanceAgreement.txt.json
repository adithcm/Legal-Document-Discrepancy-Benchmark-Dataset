                "original_text": "(b) If AT&T advises Vendor of, or Vendor becomes aware of a landlord complaint, Vendor shall, if necessary, promptly respond to the landlord complaint, shall commence any agreed upon corrections promptly, and shall diligently pursue the same until completion.",
                "changed_text": "(b) If AT&T advises Vendor of, or Vendor becomes aware of a landlord complaint, Vendor may respond to the landlord complaint, may commence any agreed upon corrections, and may pursue the same until completion.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the 'shall' obligations to 'may' and creates an omission that may impact compliance with building codes and regulations. This creates a legal contradiction with landlord-tenant law where tenants and invitees are assumed to have a right to remedy a complaint against a premises.",

Vendor shall procure all approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits that such Laws require for the performance of this Agreement. Vendor shall create and maintain any necessary records and provide any certificate, affidavit or other information or documentation requested or as otherwise required by AT&T: (a) to show compliance by Vendor and its Subcontractors with Laws, (b) to comply or otherwise establish AT&T's compliance with Laws or (c) to allow AT&T to timely respond to any complaints, filings, or other proceedings.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Vendor shall try to comply with all Laws applicable to Vendor's performance under this Agreement, including all Work contemplated herein and all Material, Services and Deliverables provided hereunder, and AT&T's utilization of the Cell Sites. Vendor may procure approvals, bonds, certificates, insurance, inspections, licenses, and permits for the performance of this Agreement. Vendor shall create records if needed and provide certificates, affidavits or other information or documentation if requested by AT&T.",
                "explanation": "The removal of Vendor's mandatory compliance with all laws and permits and the dilution of the obligation weakens required adherence to laws and regulations regarding the performance. This introduces a legal risk with any applicable regulatory body, especially regarding construction and telecommunication laws.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the mandate for vendors to conduct their business with an abiding respect for Sustainability and human rights. This presents potential risks related to ethical sourcing, fair labor standards, and human rights. These standards are generally required for businesses to legally operate in most states, and by vendors providing services to a major telecom corp.",

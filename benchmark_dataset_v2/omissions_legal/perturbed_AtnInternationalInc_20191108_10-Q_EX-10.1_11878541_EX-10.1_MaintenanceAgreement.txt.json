                "explanation": "By removing the specific liability limits, and the specifics about providing additional insured endorsement documents, the modified contract introduces a significant **legal risk**. State laws often mandate minimum liability coverage for construction-related activities. The requirement to provide a copy of the additional insured endorsement is important to confirm compliance. Without specific language, the contract could be interpreted as allowing minimal coverage, potentially contradicting legal standards and putting AT&T at risk.",

This poses a security risk and violates security policies of many companies which require the return of ID cards. Additionally, this omission is a **legal contradiction** because it could violate state laws requiring companies to keep track of who has access to sensitive company locations.",

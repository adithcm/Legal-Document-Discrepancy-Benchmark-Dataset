                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements. The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",

The undersigned acknowledge that each may or may not be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall be responsible\" to \"may or may not be responsible\", the legal obligation for timely filing and accuracy is removed. This creates ambiguity and weakens the accountability of the parties involved, contradicting SEC regulations (specifically, Rule 13d-1) that require accurate and timely filings to ensure transparency and investor protection.",

                "explanation": "By stating each is 'not responsible' for timely filings and accuracy removes the legal duty each member of the group has to ensure correct reporting to the SEC. This directly violates the intention of Rule 13d-1 which is to hold each individual involved in the filing accountable for providing true and accurate details.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exception clause \"except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate\", the statement suggests an unrealistic and legally unsustainable degree of separation between the parties. The original clause provides a reasonable level of shared responsibility when inaccuracies are known or suspected. Removing it implies that parties are never responsible for others' inaccuracies, even with knowledge, which is a risky legal position that contradicts the collaborative nature expected in joint filings under SEC regulations.",

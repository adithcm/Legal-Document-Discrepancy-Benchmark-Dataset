                "explanation": "By removing 'find liquidity and seek price levels' along with 'broker' from the transaction settlement description, the contract omits the broker's legally mandated role in ensuring fair market practices and best execution for the client. This violates the SEC's duty of best execution, which requires brokers to seek the most favorable terms reasonably available for customer orders.",

Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models.

                "explanation": "By omitting 'independent', 'published reports', 'on-site observation of company operations', 'trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry', the contract weakens the requirement for thorough and unbiased research. This omission could lead to conflicts of interest not being identified or disclosed, violating regulations requiring transparency and impartiality in investment advice. Removing 'independent' weakens the research credibility and analysts are no longer required to perform duties with unbiased care.",

This violates regulations that mandate risk management procedures and stress testing of financial models used for investment decisions. Risk assessment is not there so it breaks the contract. Quantitative analysis usually assesses risk, so the change made to the document creates contradictions.",

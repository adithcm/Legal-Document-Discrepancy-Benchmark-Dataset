                "original_text": "7A. Insurance In order to provide insurance coverage for CBC responsibilities, obligations and undertakings as set out under this Agreement and/or as required under any law with respect to the manufacturing of Bromelain SP, CBC undertakes, at its sole cost and expense, to take out and maintain an \"All risk\" insurance against loss of and destruction or damage to the Facility (including fire, theft and vandalism, etc.), third party liability insurance, product liability insurance for the Bromelain SP and employers liability insurance. Without prejudice to the above, CBC shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained with respect to itself and each of its Affiliates, such types and levels of insurance (including, without limitation, third party and product liability insurance), as are customary in the pharmaceutical or manufacturing industry to provide coverage for their activities contemplated hereby. Upon request of MediWound, CBC shall keep MediWound informed of the general parameters of its liability insurance program and any proposed substantive changes therein. Upon request, CBC shall furnish MediWound certification of insurance (and/or true copies of policies) showing the above coverage, signed by an authorized agent of the insurance company, certifying that liability assumed under this Agreement is fully insured without exception, and providing for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice.",
                "changed_text": "7A. Insurance To provide insurance coverage for CBC responsibilities, CBC may obtain insurance against loss or damage to the Facility, and may obtain third party liability insurance, product liability insurance for the Bromelain SP and employers liability insurance. CBC will inform MediWound of its insurance program if MediWound requests this information.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory aspect of insurance coverage for CBC, weakening MediWound's protection. Specifically, by replacing 'CBC undertakes, at its sole cost and expense, to take out and maintain an \"All risk\" insurance' with 'CBC may obtain insurance', the obligation for insurance is removed. Further, the requirements for levels of insurance customary in the industry, along with the obligation to provide proof of insurance and advanced notice of changes, are all deleted.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and potential violation of general corporate liability standards which often require adequate insurance coverage. Vague and may fail to meet requirements of insurance standards in New York, where the agreement is governed.",

For such purpose, and without derogating from other terms herein, CBC shall permit MediWound, and/or a consultant on MediWound's behalf, to access and inspect the CBC facility and advise MediWound and/or CBC on such actions to be taken for accomplishing such compliance. Such mutual regulatory preparations shall begin no later than the finalization of MediWound's current phase III clinical trial. CBC warrants and represents that all Bromelain SP shall be manufactured and supplied in compliance with the Specifications, quality control methods and test methods, all applicable SOP's and all applicable laws, and in accordance with GACP, cGMP, including the relevant guidelines, policies, codes, requirements, regulations, approvals and/or standards from time to time promulgated or issued by any relevant governmental and/or regulatory authority which relate to the manufacture of the Bromelain SP to be used for the production of a pharmaceutical agent as the Product. CBC warrants further that CBC has, and will for the duration of this Agreement retain, all applicable regulatory approvals required for the carrying out of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation the manufacturing, packaging and supply of the Bromelain SP.",

CBC warrants and represents that all Bromelain SP shall be manufactured and supplied in compliance with quality control methods and test methods and applicable laws. CBC warrants that CBC will retain regulatory approvals required for its obligations.",
                "explanation": "This removes the explicit obligations for CBC to adhere to specific manufacturing standards like GACP, cGMP, ISO 22000, and all other applicable laws and regulations beyond simply 'applicable laws'. The right for MediWound to inspect the facility to ensure compliance is removed. The omission of these detailed standards lowers the bar for CBC, exposing MediWound to greater risk if Bromelain SP does not meet necessary quality and safety benchmarks.",

MediWound's explicit right to reject non-compliant batches is replaced with a vague requirement for negotiation. This change weakens MediWound's ability to enforce quality control, as they no longer have a guaranteed right to reject batches that don't meet specifications, and shifts the process to an undefined negotiation.",

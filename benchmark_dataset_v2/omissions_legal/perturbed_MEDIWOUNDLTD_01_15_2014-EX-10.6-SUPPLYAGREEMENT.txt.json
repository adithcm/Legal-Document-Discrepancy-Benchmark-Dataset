This could introduce legal risk if the product is not manufactured according to the required standards in the target market.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'as required under any law with respect to the manufacturing of Bromelain SP' and 'All risk' insurance against loss of and destruction or damage to the Facility (including fire, theft and vandalism, etc.)', the contract no longer explicitly requires CBC to maintain insurance coverage mandated by applicable laws, specifically concerning product liability for the Bromelain SP, potentially violating regulations regarding pharmaceutical manufacturing and liability.",

                "original_text": "If there is a dispute between the parties as to whether any Bromelain SP sample or batch complies with the sample or batch Specifications respectively and/or with the quality requirements set forth herein and/or under the law, then, without derogating from MediWound's remedies under this Agreement or at law, such dispute shall be resolved by mutual investigation of the parties which shall be conducted in good faith. If the parties are still unable to resolve such dispute, an independent, mutually agreed third party shall be retained as a consultant to review batch records and related documentation. Such consultant's determination in respect of the conformity of a sample or batch shall be binding upon the parties. The non-prevailing party shall bear the costs of consultant's services as well as for the production of the batch and corrective actions. If appropriate, pursuant to such investigation and/or consultant's determination, CBC shall replace the non-complying Bromelain SP within 30 (thirty) days thereafter, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs).",

If the parties are still unable to resolve such dispute, the parties can decide if a third-party consultant shall be retained.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'and/or under the law, then, without derogating from MediWound's remedies under this Agreement or at law' and changing from 'shall be retained' to 'can decide if' limits MediWound's options for legal recourse if the product does not comply with standards set in place by law and reduces the certainty of third-party resolution. Deleting the last sentence entirely removes the obligation for the supplier to replace non-conforming products at their cost. This potentially conflicts with consumer protection laws in New York, which emphasize product safety and compliance with regulatory standards.",

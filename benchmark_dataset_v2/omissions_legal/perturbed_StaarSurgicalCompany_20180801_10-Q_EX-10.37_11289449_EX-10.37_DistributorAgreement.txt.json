                "original_text": "9.1 STAAR warrants that, for the period of twelve (12) months from the date of delivery to Distributor hereunder (the \"Warranty Period\"), the Products will meet STAAR's published specifications or labeling for such Products as in effect at the time of such delivery (\"Warranty\"). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR's option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR's expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period.",
                "changed_text": "9.1 STAAR warrants that the Products will meet STAAR's specifications or labeling for such Products. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 12-month warranty period and the exclusive remedy clause (repair or replacement) significantly reduces consumer protection. Many jurisdictions have implied warranties of merchantability that cannot be disclaimed so broadly. The removal of the clause that the products will meet STAAR's specifications or labeling for such products is illegal and unlawful as it does not state what the product should achieve or be by default.",

On a separate endorsement, Distributor shall name STAAR as an additional named insured. Such separate endorsement shall indicate that Distributor's insurance is primary and that STAAR's coverage as an additional named insured is not contributory. Each such insurance policy and endorsement shall provide that the insurance will not be canceled or reduces without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to STAAR. On request, Distributor shall provide STAAR with copies or certificates of all such insurance policies.",

                "explanation": "Removing the minimum coverage amounts (US$2 million per occurrence, US$5 million in the aggregate), the requirement for STAAR to be named as an additional insured, and the 30-day cancellation notice weakens STAAR's protection. If the distributorship is in a state like California, minimum liability coverage is often mandated for businesses, and the omission of a specific amount creates legal risk. The removal of the term 'at its own expense' means STAAR could be liable for some of those costs.",

                "original_text": "25.2 The parties waive their rights to seek remedies in court (except where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief), including any right to a jury trial. Except in a case where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief, the parties agree that any dispute between the parties arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, whether characterized or sounding in contract or tort or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California, USA. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses of the arbitration, but the arbitration fees and costs shall be borne equally between the parties participating in the arbitration. Disputes shall not be resolved in any other forum or venue.",

The arbitration shall be held at a venue determined by STAAR. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses of the arbitration.",
                "explanation": "Removing the exception for injunctive or equitable relief and the reference to the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce and the requirement for the arbitration to be held in Los Angeles and instead permitting the venue to be determined by STAAR limits the Distributor's rights and remedies. The removal of the 'borne equally' creates a large opportunity for STAAR to have all the fees allocated to the distributor if need be, which is a power imbalance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of fair arbitration and due process, depending on how the 'venue determined by STAAR' is implemented. Creates potential unconscionability issues.",

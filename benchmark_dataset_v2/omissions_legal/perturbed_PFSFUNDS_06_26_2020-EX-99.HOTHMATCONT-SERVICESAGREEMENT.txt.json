                "original_text": "The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from any inaccurate or incomplete statement provided by the Adviser (or its officers, employees, directors and agents) for inclusion in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser agrees to indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against liability, losses, claims and damages arising from willful misfeasance or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clauses regarding 'inaccurate or incomplete statement' in the prospectus and statement of additional information and 'bad faith or reckless disregard', the agreement weakens the Adviser's responsibility for ensuring accurate information and acting in good faith. Under Massachusetts law (where the Trust is located), investment advisors have a fiduciary duty to their clients, which includes providing accurate and complete information and acting in good faith. The omission of these clauses attempts to limit the adviser's liability beyond what is legally permissible, creating a legal contradiction.",

Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall create and maintain records pertaining to the various functions performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party pursuant to contract with the Trust.",
                "explanation": "Removing the explicit requirement to adhere to Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 31a-2 weakens the record-keeping obligations. These regulations specify the types of records that investment advisors must maintain, the retention periods, and where they must be stored. By omitting this reference, the agreement attempts to circumvent legally mandated record-keeping practices, which violates federal securities laws.",

                "original_text": "This Services Agreement shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as hereinafter provided, if such continuance is approved at least annually by vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or the Adviser. This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party.",

This Agreement may be terminated by the Adviser upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Trust. The Trust may only terminate the agreement if the Adviser has committed gross negligence or willful misconduct.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a discrepancy regarding termination rights. While it allows the Adviser to terminate with 60 days' notice, it severely restricts the Trust's ability to terminate, requiring proof of 'gross negligence or willful misconduct.' This change limits the Trust's rights and conflicts with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates that the investment advisory agreement must be terminable 'at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by the board of directors or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the company.' By imposing strict conditions on the Trust's ability to terminate without cause, the agreement violates this provision of the Act.",

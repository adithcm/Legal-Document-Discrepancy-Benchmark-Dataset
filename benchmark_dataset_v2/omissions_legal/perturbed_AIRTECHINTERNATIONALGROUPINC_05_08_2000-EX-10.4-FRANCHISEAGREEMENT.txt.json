                "original_text": "You shall procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement, at Your expense, insurance policies written by an insurance company satisfactory to AIRSOPURE in accordance with standards and specifications set forth in the Operations Manual or otherwise by AIRSOPURE in writing. Such policies shall name AIRSOPURE as an additional insured and shall include, at a minimum:\n\nA. Comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00.\n\nB. Comprehensive automobile liability insurance, including collision, comprehensive, medical and liability to satisfy state law requirements.",

Such policies shall name AIRSOPURE as an additional insured and shall include:\n\nA. General liability insurance.\n\nB. Automobile liability insurance, to satisfy state law requirements.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive', 'satisfactory to AIRSOPURE', and the specific minimum coverage amount of '$1,000,000.00' for general liability insurance significantly weakens the insurance requirement. This creates a legal risk, as many states mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial leases, and failing to specify this amount could render the franchisee underinsured and non-compliant with those state laws.",

                "original_text": "At least 7 days prior to the opening of the Center and on each policy renewal date thereafter, You shall submit to AIRSOPURE copies of all policies and policy amendments. The evidence of insurance shall include a statement by the insurer that the policy or policies will not be canceled or materially altered without at least 30 days prior written notice to AIRSOPURE.",
                "changed_text": "You shall submit to AIRSOPURE copies of insurance policies. Evidence of insurance alteration is not required.",
                "explanation": "Deleting 'At least 7 days prior to the opening of the Center and on each policy renewal date thereafter' eliminates a crucial compliance measure. The omission of the 'statement by the insurer that the policy or policies will not be canceled or materially altered without at least 30 days prior written notice to AIRSOPURE' requirement introduces legal risk because it removes AIRSOPURE's ability to be proactively informed of policy changes that could violate state or federal law regarding liability coverage. It also contradicts the duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion. There are no refunds under any other circumstances.",

                "explanation": "This omission removes the franchisee's right to a potential refund of a portion of the franchise fee if a suitable location cannot be found. Many state franchise laws (including those in Texas, where the agreement is governed) require specific disclosures and potential refunds under certain circumstances. Removing this refund provision creates a legal risk, as it may conflict with state franchise regulations designed to protect franchisees.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'Comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00' eliminates a specific, substantial insurance requirement. Many states mandate that businesses carry specific minimum amounts of liability coverage to protect consumers and third parties. By omitting this mandatory coverage, the franchise agreement becomes non-compliant. This creates a **legal contradiction** with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial liability insurance.",

                "explanation": "By removing the mediation clause entirely, the contract eliminates an alternative dispute resolution process. While not always legally required, some jurisdictions favor or even mandate mediation for certain types of disputes before litigation. This removal, while not a direct violation of a mandatory law in Texas for this specific type of agreement, increases the legal risk by bypassing a potentially quicker and cheaper resolution method, which could be seen negatively by courts.",

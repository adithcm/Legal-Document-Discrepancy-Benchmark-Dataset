                "original_text": "HERC shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense, from a qualified AAA-rated insurance company, a standard liability insurance and business interruption policy along with advertising injury protection, all of which must be acceptable to THC and HSI, and which must name THC and HSI as additional insureds. Such policy shall provide, in addition to other protection, protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim. The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage. HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement. In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",

HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'AAA-rated', 'business interruption policy', 'advertising injury protection', and the specific minimum coverage amount ($3,000,000) significantly weakens the insurance requirement, creating potential legal risk. Also, the removal of the deductible amount weakens the requirements. This introduces a legal risk as it doesn't ensure adequate financial protection for potential liabilities, especially in states like Florida where specific minimum liability coverage is often mandated for commercial operations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates general principles of commercial liability and insurance requirements depending on jurisdiction, specifically if the coverage is insufficient to meet legal standards for the types of risks associated with equipment rental businesses. Could violate Florida statutes related to business liability and insurance requirements if the resulting coverage is deemed inadequate.",

                "explanation": "Removing the exception clause allows Hertz to prevent HERC from engaging in aspects of vehicle rental business that they would have otherwise been allowed to do. The removal of the qualifier 'except to the extent materially consistent in type and scope with HERC's operations immediately prior to the date of this IPA' could create antitrust concerns depending on the jurisdiction and the specific market conditions. Without this clause, there is no restriction on whether Hertz acts as a competitor, thus violating the tenants of competition/antitrust practices.",

If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",

                "explanation": "By removing the words 'material' and all content after 'written notice', all breaches of this agreement can lead to termination of the contract. It is also removed that HERC is able to remedy the breach within 30 days of being notified about it. The removal of the ability to 'cure' the breach may be an extreme measure that makes the contract unfair. This may violate contract law.",

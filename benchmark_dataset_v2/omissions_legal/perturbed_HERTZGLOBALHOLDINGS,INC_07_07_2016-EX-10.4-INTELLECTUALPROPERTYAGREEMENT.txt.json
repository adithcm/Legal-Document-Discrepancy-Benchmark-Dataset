                "original_text": "HERC shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense, from a qualified AAA-rated insurance company, a standard liability insurance and business interruption policy along with advertising injury 7 protection, all of which must be acceptable to THC and HSI, and which must name THC and HSI as additional insureds. Such policy shall provide, in addition to other protection, protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim. The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage. HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement. In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",

HERC shall provide Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'from a qualified AAA-rated insurance company', 'advertising injury protection', 'all of which must be acceptable to THC and HSI, and which must name THC and HSI as additional insureds', 'any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim', 'The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage', 'HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination' and 'In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the minimum coverage amount eliminates an important compliance measure. The removal of the other parts related to 'AAA-rated', 'ten days notice' and 'no prior promoting' created a **legal contradiction** with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial leases, requirements for insurance companies and acting negligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but examples include state-specific commercial lease laws requiring minimum insurance coverage (e.g., California Civil Code Section 1938), requirements for using only 'admitted' or qualified insurance companies, and duty of reasonable care to avoid negligence.",

                "original_text": "In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may terminate this Agreement upon written notice.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'material' and the clause related to 'cure breach' and 'opportunity to cure breach' introduces a significant imbalance in the contract. Many jurisdictions require that a party be given an opportunity to cure a breach before the contract can be terminated, especially for non-material breaches. This violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most US contract law.",

                "explanation": "By changing the severability clause from 'will not affect' to 'will affect' means if a part of the contract is deemed illegal, the whole contract can be void. This is against of the standard legal principles. Standard clause is there to save the contract from illegal sections, not to kill the contract.",

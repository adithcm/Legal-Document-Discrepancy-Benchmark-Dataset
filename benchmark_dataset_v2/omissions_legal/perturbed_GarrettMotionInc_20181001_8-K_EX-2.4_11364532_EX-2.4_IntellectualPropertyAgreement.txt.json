The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain Honeywell IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, \"Honeywell Shared IP\"). With regard to the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have-made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.",

These restrictions could contradict antitrust laws if they unduly limit SpinCo's ability to compete, by requiring SpinCo to pay royalties later, restricting the term of the license, or limiting the geographic scope or sublicenseability of the license. Antitrust laws are intended to prevent restraints on trade and promote competition. Removing the royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual nature makes SpinCo dependent and weakens its position.",

All sales of Merchandise will be \"final sales\" and \"as is,\" and appropriate signage and sales receipts will reflect the same. Agent shall not warrant the Merchandise in any manner, but will, to the extent legally permissible, pass on all manufacturers' warranties to customers. All sales will be made only for cash or nationally recognized bank credit cards. Upon entry of the Approval Order, Agent shall not accept or honor coupons during the Sale Term. The Agent shall clearly mark all receipts for the Merchandise sold at the Stores during the Sale Term so as to distinguish such Merchandise from the goods sold prior to the Sale Commencement Date. Unless otherwise agreed between Agent and the issuer of Merchant's private-label credit cards (\"PLCCs\"), Agent shall not accept PLCCs as a form of payment during the Sale.",

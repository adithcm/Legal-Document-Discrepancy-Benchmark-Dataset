                "original_text": "A. CONTENT PROVIDER shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, save and hold harmless COMPANY and its successors, subdistributors, sublicensees, assigns, agents, representatives and affiliates from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, liability, loss, damage, cost and expense (including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) incurred or sustained by reason of or arising out of any breach or alleged breach of any of the warranties, representations or agreements herein made by CONTENT PROVIDER, or by reason of any action, claim or proceeding related to or arising out of such breach or alleged breach by CONTENT PROVIDER. In the event that any person or entity shall make any claim or institute any suit or proceeding, COMPANY shall notify CONTENT PROVIDER in writing, and CONTENT PROVIDER must assume, at it own cost and expense, the defense thereof; provided, however, that COMPANY'S failure to provide such notice shall not affect this indemnity unless CONTENT PROVIDER has been materially prejudiced by such failure. COMPANY may, at its sole discretion, engage its own counsel in connection with any such suit, claim or proceeding, and the cost thereof (including reasonable fees and expenses) shall be borne by CONTENT PROVIDER provided that CONTENT PROVIDER shall in any event fulfill its obligation to undertake COMPANY'S defense. The final control and disposition of any claim, whether by settlement, compromise or otherwise, shall remain with COMPANY pursuant to the terms of this indemnification paragraph. In the event that CONTENT PROVIDER fails to promptly make any required payment to COMPANY, COMPANY shall have the right to withhold for its own account any royalties or other monies payable to CONTENT PROVIDER by COMPANY pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement between CONTENT PROVIDER and COMPANY.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'at its sole cost and expense', 'save and hold harmless', 'any and all', 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs', and weakening the notice provision and cost allocation for legal defense undermines COMPANY's indemnification rights. Under California law, an indemnification clause must clearly state the scope and extent of the indemnification, including the obligation to cover legal fees and costs. By omitting these specific terms, the contract becomes ambiguous and potentially unenforceable in critical areas.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the change in section 13A, this change removes key phrases ('at its sole cost and expense', 'save and hold harmless', 'any and all', 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs') from COMPANY's indemnification obligations to CONTENT PROVIDER. Additionally, weakening the notice and legal defense provisions again creates ambiguity and undermines the strength of the indemnity. This could lead to disputes over the scope of indemnification and the responsibility for covering legal costs.",

Each party hereby agrees that any such court shall have in personam jurisdiction over it, consents to service of process in any manner prescribed or authorized by California Law, and agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner specified by Law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specification of Los Angeles County as the venue and the waiver of claims regarding forum convenience significantly weakens the enforceability of the agreement. California law generally respects forum selection clauses, but omitting the county makes the venue clause vague and could allow disputes to be litigated in less convenient locations for one or both parties. Additionally removing the consent to personal jurisdiction may create issues about being able to legally pursue action against entities in California.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Supplier shall provide workers with clean, safe and healthy work environments; recognize and respect the right of employees to free association and collective bargaining in accordance with law; comply with all applicable wage and hour laws; and properly verify the employment eligibility of its employees.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier shall provide workers with work environments and properly verify the employment eligibility of its employees.",
                "explanation": "Removing the provisions for clean, safe, and healthy work environments, the recognition of the right to free association and collective bargaining, and compliance with wage and hour laws introduces a contradiction with labor laws in many jurisdictions, including the United States, which mandate these worker protections. The omission creates a legal risk as it suggests a disregard for legally required worker rights.",
                "contradicted_law": "Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and OSHA regulations",
                "location": "Section 17.1"

                "original_text": "Suppliers will not employ, use or otherwise benefit from involuntary labor, forced labor, or labor that results from slavery or human trafficking. Supplier hereby certifies that: (i) it is in compliance with this paragraph; and (ii) all materials incorporated into its products comply with all applicable laws addressing slavery, human trafficking and other forms of forced labor. Supplier shall provide PNC with documentation establishing compliance with this paragraph upon [***] notice.",
                "changed_text": "Suppliers will not employ, use or otherwise benefit from involuntary labor. ",
                "explanation": "By omitting 'forced labor, or labor that results from slavery or human trafficking' and the certification/documentation requirements related to compliance with anti-slavery/human trafficking laws, the contract weakens its commitment to preventing these abuses. This creates a legal risk, especially under laws like the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and similar federal regulations that require companies to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, UK Modern Slavery Act, and federal laws prohibiting forced labor and human trafficking.",

                "original_text": "Supplier will not employ anyone under the legal working age defined by local law. Supplier will comply with all applicable laws addressing the working requirements and conditions for child workers.",
                "changed_text": "Supplier will not employ anyone under the age of 14.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the requirement to comply with 'the legal working age defined by local law' with a fixed age of 14 creates a contradiction with child labor laws in many jurisdictions. Many countries and even some states within the U.S. have minimum working ages higher than 14, and some also have restrictions on the types of work that individuals under 16 or 18 can perform. This modification introduces a legal risk as it permits actions that may be illegal under local laws.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'social security' and 'unemployment' from the list of benefits the consultant is not entitled to, the contract implies that they might be entitled to those benefits. This contradicts the explicit independent contractor status defined in Section 9 and introduces ambiguity regarding the company's obligations under Massachusetts law for payroll taxes and unemployment insurance, creating potential legal risk. Under Massachusetts law, misclassifying an employee as an independent contractor can lead to significant penalties.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"Consultant's best efforts\" to \"Consultant's efforts\" lowers the standard of care required of the consultant. Removing \"reasonably\" from \"as may be reasonably required\" increases the potential burden on the company to provide access to information.

There could be disputes over the work quality expected.",

                "explanation": "Removing \"without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond\" weakens the company's ability to quickly and efficiently obtain injunctive relief in case of a breach. Under Massachusetts law, preliminary injunctions typically require a showing of irreparable harm and, often, the posting of a bond. This omission creates a legal risk by suggesting that the company might be able to bypass these requirements, which is unlikely and could lead to procedural challenges and delays in obtaining relief.",

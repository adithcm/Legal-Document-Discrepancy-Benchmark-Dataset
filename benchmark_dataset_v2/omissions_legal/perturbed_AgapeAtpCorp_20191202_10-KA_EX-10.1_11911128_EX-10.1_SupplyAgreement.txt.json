                "changed_text": "The Manufacturer covenants that it will make reasonable efforts to comply with Local Laws and Regulations relating to business practice.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the manufacturer's commitment to full legal compliance. By changing 'is and will remain in compliance' to 'will make reasonable efforts to comply,' the contract allows for potential non-compliance. This creates a legal contradiction because many jurisdictions have strict liability laws concerning certain business practices, workplace relations, safety, and taxation, particularly in Vanuatu and Hong Kong, where the Manufacturer and Customer are based, respectively. The original clause ensured adherence to these laws; the revised version introduces ambiguity and potential legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a guarantee against foreseeable damage during shipment. The modified clause weakens this to an attempt to minimize potential damage, removing the guarantee. This introduces a legal risk under the Sale of Goods Act in jurisdictions like England (chosen governing law), which implies certain conditions regarding the quality and fitness of goods for purpose, including that they must be adequately packaged for transit. Removing the guarantee shifts the risk of damage during transit to the Customer, potentially violating implied warranty provisions.",

                "changed_text": "The Manufacturing Companies may maintain product liability insurance to cover the liability of the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that manufacturing companies maintain product liability insurance, protecting the Customer. The modified clause makes this insurance optional ('may maintain'), significantly increasing the Customer's risk. This creates a legal contradiction because, depending on the jurisdiction and product type, there are regulations regarding product liability and the responsibilities of manufacturers and distributors. Eliminating the mandatory insurance shifts the entire burden of potential product liability claims onto the Customer, which may violate consumer protection laws or principles of reasonable commercial practice.",

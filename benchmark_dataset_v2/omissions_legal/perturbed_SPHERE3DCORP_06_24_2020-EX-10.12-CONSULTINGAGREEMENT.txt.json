Consultant hereby represents that it has in place policies and procedures relating to, and addressing, with the commercially reasonable intent to ensure compliance with, all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the use, release or other publication of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act and disclosure requirements outlined in Section 17B of the Exchange Act regarding the required disclosure of the nature and terms of its relationship with the Company in any and all literature or other communication(s) relating to these services, including but not limited to: Press Releases, letters to investors and telephone or other personal communication(s) with potential or current investors. In addition, Consultant acknowledges that United States securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder prohibit any person with material, non- public information about a company from purchasing, selling, trading, or entering into options, puts, calls or other derivatives in respect of securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person or entity and Consultant shall comply with such laws, rules and regulations. Consultant will take no action to manipulate the market price of the Company's securities in violation of law or regulation, nor pay or otherwise induce others to take any such actions, nor publish comments about the Company without appropriately disclosing payments received therefor.",

                "explanation": "By removing the consultant's representation that it has policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with securities laws, the contract creates a legal risk. It removes the consultant's explicit acknowledgement and commitment to adhere to critical securities regulations, including disclosing their relationship with the company, and preventing insider trading practices. This omission exposes both the consultant and the company to potential liabilities and penalties under United States securities laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'unless said Damages arise out of the negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, its members, affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns' significantly broadens the Consultant's indemnification obligations. Without this exception, the Consultant is now responsible for indemnifying the Company even if the damages were caused by the Company's own negligence or willful misconduct. This contradicts the standard principle of indemnity, as New York law (specified in the contract) generally does not allow a party to be indemnified for its own intentional wrongdoing, creating a legal risk.",

In the event any provision of this Consulting Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the parties will negotiate in good faith to restore the unenforceable provision to an enforceable state and to provide reasonable additions or adjustments to the terms of the other provisions of this Consulting Agreement so as to render the whole Consulting Agreement valid and binding to the fullest extent possible, and in any event, this Consulting Agreement shall be interpreted to be valid and binding to the fullest extent possible.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'good faith negotiation' and 'adjustments to other terms' clauses from the severability section, the contract eliminates a mechanism for preserving the original intent of the agreement if a portion is deemed unenforceable. This can lead to unintended consequences and potentially invalidate the entire agreement if an essential clause is struck down. Under New York contract law, courts generally prefer to enforce contracts as closely as possible to the parties' original intent. Removing the remedial measures can increase the risk that a severability issue could render the entire contract void, increasing overall legal risk.",

                "original_text": "o Driver will scan the customers ID using the Trulioo API right before they handle the delivery to the customer. After this last ID check, the transaction will be completed.",
                "changed_text": "o The transaction will be completed upon delivery, without mandatory ID verification.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for the driver to scan the customer's ID using the Trulioo API before handing over the delivery, the contract removes a crucial step for age and identity verification related to cannabis delivery. Washington state law requires stringent measures to ensure that cannabis is not delivered to underage individuals. By omitting this step, the agreement creates a significant legal risk.",
                "contradicted_law": "Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 314-55-087 and RCW 69.50.412 - addresses requirements for verifying age and preventing sales to minors.",

                "changed_text": "o State Module - Creating state rules. Purchase limits will be set based on company policy.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the explicit acknowledgement and adherence to state-defined legal age to purchase cannabis and stating the purchase limits will be set based on the company policy, the contract potentially contradicts Washington state law. Washington State mandates specific purchase limits for cannabis products, and these limits cannot be overridden by company policy.",
                "contradicted_law": "Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 314-55-085 - sets limits on the amount of cannabis a customer can purchase.",

                "changed_text": "Each driver will have a set amount of time to accept or reject the order.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the automated rejection and recording of the lack of response for future reference undermines fair labor practices. While not explicitly mandated by a single labor law, it deviates from best practices aimed at fair assessment and potential for bias, as it removes an element of objective measurement.",
                "contradicted_law": "While not a direct violation, this omission can expose Pelican Delivers to potential claims of unfair labor practices as the lack of objective measurement might introduce bias or discriminatory practices, conflicting with general labor laws.",

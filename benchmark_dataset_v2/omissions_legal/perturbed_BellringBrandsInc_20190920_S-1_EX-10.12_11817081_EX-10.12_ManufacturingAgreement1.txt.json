                "explanation": "The removal of the specific insurance coverage amounts (limits) violates standard business practices and potentially conflicts with legal requirements regarding minimum liability coverage in California. The elimination of the requirement for the insurer to acknowledge contractual liability, additional insured status, primary coverage, and waiver of subrogation significantly weakens Premier's protection and contradicts common risk management practices. This introduces substantial legal risk.",

Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R.

The deletion of 'in all material respects', 'each Specification is signed and dated by the Parties' and 'shall not be adulterated within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act' and 'approved by Premier in writing' significantly reduces Premier's protection against non-compliant or unsafe products.",

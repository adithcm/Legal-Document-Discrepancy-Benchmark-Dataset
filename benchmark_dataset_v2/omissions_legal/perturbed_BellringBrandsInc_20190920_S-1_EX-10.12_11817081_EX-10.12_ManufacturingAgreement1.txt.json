Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food\" and as it may be amended from time-to-time.",

Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from major defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'all' from laws and regulations, plus the selective removal of FDA compliance and the specific GMP standards (21 C.F.R. Part 110), weakens the commitment to quality and safety. By changing 'all defects' to 'major defects', this reduces consumer protection. California law, where Heritage is based, has stringent food safety regulations which might be undermined.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the guarantee of 'merchantable' and the specific reference to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, along with changing 'free of contaminants' to 'generally free of significant contaminants,' weakens consumer protection against adulterated or unsafe products. This could be a violation of consumer protection laws that ensure products meet certain quality standards and are safe for consumption or use.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'hold all' to 'intend to maintain' introduces uncertainty regarding compliance with licensing requirements. Also, 'will obtain' to 'will attempt to obtain' weakens the obligation to use approved suppliers. This introduces a **legal risk**, potentially violating laws that mandate specific permits and approved supply chains for food manufacturing facilities. By using terms like 'intend to' and 'attempt to,' the manufacturer is not fully committing to these consumer rights.",

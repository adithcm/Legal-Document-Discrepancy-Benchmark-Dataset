                "changed_text": "Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made at Bunker One's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the payment terms introduces a legal risk, as prompt payment is essential in commercial transactions. State laws (e.g., Alabama's Uniform Commercial Code) imply a reasonable time for payment, but this vague term gives Bunker One excessive power and violates standards of good faith and fair dealing.",

The Parties shall endeavor to resolve any disputes promptly, and the disputed amount found due, if any, plus accrued interest at the Interest Rate shall be paid within three (3) Business Days following resolution of the dispute.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to pay the undisputed portion and accrued interest, the contract now contradicts the principle of 'good faith' dealings required by Alabama law (and generally implied in contract law). This could be viewed as an unfair business practice and violates basic contract law principles.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'has to indemnify' to 'may, at its sole discretion, indemnify' makes the indemnification clause optional, which contradicts the fundamental principle of indemnification in contract law. This violates the reasonable expectations of the non-defaulting party and creates a significant legal loophole regarding liability. Such a clause would likely be challenged and potentially deemed unconscionable under Alabama law.",

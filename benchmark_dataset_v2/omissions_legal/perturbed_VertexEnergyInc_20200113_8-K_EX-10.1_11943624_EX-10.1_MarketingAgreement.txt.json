                "explanation": "Removing the waiver of the right to a jury trial from this section, although it is mentioned again in Section 13.3(e), creates ambiguity and potentially weakens consumer rights, especially if one party is significantly smaller or less informed than the other. While there is an arbitration clause, the removal of this waiver from this section of the jurisdiction discussion opens a loophole.

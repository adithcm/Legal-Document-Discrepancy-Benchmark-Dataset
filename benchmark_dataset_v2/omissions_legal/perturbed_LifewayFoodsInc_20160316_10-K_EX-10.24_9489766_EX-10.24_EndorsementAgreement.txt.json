                "explanation": "By removing subsection (c), the agreement no longer explicitly warrants compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This creates a legal risk, as such compliance is generally implied and often legally required, especially in areas like advertising and product safety. The omission introduces ambiguity and weakens the consumer protection implicitly afforded by warranting legal compliance.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'warrants that any testimonial or review provided reflects her own honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences' and replacing with 'represents', there is no guarantee of truthfulness regarding individual opinions. This creates a legal risk because consumer protection laws (e.g., those enforced by the FTC) require endorsements to reflect honest opinions and experiences. The removal of the warranty weakens the agreement's protection against false advertising claims. The inclusion of 'bona fide' has also been removed.",

These are potential causes of action that the individual could bring against Lifeway, and releasing them would protect Lifeway from litigation. Removing that clause leaves Lifeway exposed to liability, meaning they're not protected under the state law.",

                "original_text": "(o) During the period during which the Shares are registered under the 1934 Act or for three years from the date hereof, whichever period is greater, the Holding Company will furnish to its shareholders as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year an annual report of the Holding Company (including a consolidated balance sheet and statements of consolidated income, shareholders' equity and cash flows of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of and for such year, certified by independent registered public accountants in accordance with Regulation S-X under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act) and make available as soon as practicable after the end of each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal quarter ending after the effective time of the Registration Statement) financial information of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries for such quarter in reasonable detail.",
                "changed_text": "(o) The Holding Company may furnish to its shareholders an annual report of the Holding Company and make available financial information of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries for each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will furnish' to 'may furnish,' the modified contract removes the mandatory obligation to provide shareholders with annual reports, including certified financial statements. This violates securities regulations (specifically, SEC rules regarding reporting requirements for publicly traded companies) designed to ensure transparency and protect investors. Shareholders are no longer guaranteed access to essential financial information.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandated making an earnings statement available within 60 days, complying with Rule 158. The modified version replaces 'will' with 'may,' removing the mandatory requirement and the timeline, thereby omitting a crucial aspect of investor protection and violating SEC regulations regarding disclosure of financial performance.",

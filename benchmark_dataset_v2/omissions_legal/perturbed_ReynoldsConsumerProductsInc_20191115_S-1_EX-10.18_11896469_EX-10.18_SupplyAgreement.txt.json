                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'benefits in the minimal amount required by Applicable Law' from the Workers' Compensation Liability Insurance section and the clause 'with a limit of at least $10,000,000 per occurrence or any greater limits set by Applicable Law' from the Employers' Liability Insurance section creates a legal contradiction. These omissions weaken the insurance coverage requirements, potentially leaving employees without adequate protection as mandated by Illinois law and federal regulations like OSHA.

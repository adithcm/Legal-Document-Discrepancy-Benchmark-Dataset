                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific minimum insurance coverage amounts (e.g., $10,000,000) for various liabilities. By removing these specified minimum limits, the revised clause introduces ambiguity and could potentially lead to insufficient coverage, violating standard business practices. Omitting the specification to 'All risk' for Property Insurance also reduces the scope of required coverage. Workers' Compensation Insurance must provide benefits in the minimal amount required by applicable law; this was removed, violating mandatory coverage for employee workplace injuries.",

An insuring Party must deliver the following written evidence of the required insurance coverage to the other Party (Attention: Risk Management), or its designated insurance monitoring service, within ten (10) of written request and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration of a then current policy term (if a declaration or endorsement is not available from an insurer at the time requested or required, an insuring Party will provide them as soon as the declaration or endorsement is available from the insurer):\ni.

                "explanation": "Removing the A.M. Best rating requirement allows for potentially financially unstable insurers to be used, increasing risk. Omitting the requirement for 'primary and non-contributory' insurance shifts liability to the other party's insurance. Removing the specific document requirements (certificate of insurance, declaration pages, endorsement copies) weakens the verification process and compliance, creating a legal loophole. In many states, businesses are required to show financial responsibility in case of an incident.",

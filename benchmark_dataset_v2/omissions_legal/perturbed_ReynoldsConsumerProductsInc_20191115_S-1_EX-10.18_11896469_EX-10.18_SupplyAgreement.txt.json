Commercial General Liability Insurance. Occurrence based coverage with a combined single limit of at least $10,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; broad form property damage (including completed operations); explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury. Requires additional insured endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement.",

Occurrence based coverage for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; property damage; explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the minimum insurance coverage amount ($10,000,000) eliminates a specific protection for the parties, potentially contradicting state laws that may mandate minimum coverage amounts for businesses of this size. Omitting \"Requires additional insured endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement.\" removes explicit instruction that ensures protection of both parties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state-specific insurance requirements for businesses, such as those in Illinois, where the company headquarters are located.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'in the minimal amount required by Applicable Law' and the specific Acts creates a legal risk.  It implies the company might provide less than the legally mandated coverage. Furthermore, removing \"Requires alternate employer endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement.\" eliminates explicit instruction that ensures protection of both parties.",

Certificate of insurance confirming that the required insurance coverage and minimal limits are met for the extended, renewed or replacement policy term. ii. Declaration pages of insurance policy (or a copy of the binder until the declaration pages are available) confirming that the required insurance coverage and minimal limits are met for the extended, renewed or replacement policy term. iii.

                "explanation": "Removing the specific requirements for delivering proof of insurance (including timelines and required endorsements) weakens the obligation to maintain and verify adequate insurance. Removing the explicit details about who should be listed as additional insureds and endorsement beneficiaries creates a legal loophole, potentially violating insurance regulations and putting the non-insuring party at risk. This contradicts general commercial insurance practices and could violate implied duties of good faith.",

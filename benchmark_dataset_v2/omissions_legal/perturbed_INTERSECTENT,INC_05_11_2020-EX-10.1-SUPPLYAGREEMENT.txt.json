                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period [*] after any expiration or termination of this Agreement, each of INTERSECT and HOVIONE shall maintain in full force and effect a comprehensive general liability insurance policy, including Products Liability coverage, with minimum limits of [*] for bodily injury including death.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, INTERSECT and HOVIONE shall maintain general liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the requirement to maintain a 'comprehensive' general liability insurance policy, specifically including 'Products Liability coverage' and setting 'minimum limits' weakens the protection for potential third-party claims. California law (where Intersect ENT, Inc. is located) requires businesses to maintain adequate insurance to cover potential liabilities. Removing the minimum limits and specific coverage types introduces legal risk by potentially failing to meet the 'adequate' coverage standard, especially considering the product is a combination drug and device.",

                "explanation": "Removing the jury trial waiver introduces a legal risk. While parties can agree to bench trials, the right to a jury trial is a fundamental right. Omitting the waiver means that either party can later insist on a jury trial, potentially increasing the cost and complexity of litigation. This right is upheld unless explicitly waived and omitting this clause will likely mean this will be adjudicated by a jury.",

                "explanation": "Omitting the statements guaranteeing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and maintaining the plant's availability for inspection by regulatory authorities removes critical assurances related to product quality and safety.

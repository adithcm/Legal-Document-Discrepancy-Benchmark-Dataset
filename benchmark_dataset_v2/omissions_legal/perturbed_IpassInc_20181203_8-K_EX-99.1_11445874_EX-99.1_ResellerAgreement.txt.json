                "explanation": "By removing the disclaimer of implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY and FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, the contract initially protects iPass. By removing 'INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE' it could be seen as not giving consumers the right to products that function for their intended use or of reasonable quality, violating consumer protection laws. The removal of 'TIMELY, SECURE, AVAILABLE ON A SPECIFIED DATE OR TIME OR WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MEET CHANNEL PARTNER'S OR END USER DEMAND DURING SPECIFIC HOURS' undermines expectations of service reliability.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the sentence 'The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement.' creates uncertainty regarding the agreement's applicability to international transactions. For Channel Partners operating internationally, this may unintentionally subject the agreement to the CISG, which could contradict intended California law and create legal risks.

If in iPass' reasonable determination the issue is not resolved within thirty (30) days after Channel Partner's receipt of notice of End User's dissatisfaction', the modification removes consumer protection requirements. By taking the phrases away, the changes introduce a legal contradiction as iPass is no longer legally obligated to resolve the issue 'to End User's reasonable satisfaction' nor are they required to comply with local privacy law, which is a needed consumer protection.",

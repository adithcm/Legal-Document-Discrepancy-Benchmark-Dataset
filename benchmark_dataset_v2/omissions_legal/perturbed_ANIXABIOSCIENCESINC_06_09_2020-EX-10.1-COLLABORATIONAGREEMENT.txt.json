Each Party will maintain liability insurance, with reputable and financially secure insurance carriers, at levels consistent with industry standards based upon such Party's respective activities and indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Upon request, each Party will furnish to the other Party certificates issued by the applicable insurance company(ies) evidencing such insurance.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'will' to 'may,' the requirement to maintain liability insurance is removed. This introduces legal risk because in Delaware, while there isn't a blanket requirement for all businesses to carry liability insurance, depending on the specific activities conducted under the collaboration agreement (e.g., handling hazardous materials, clinical trials), failure to maintain adequate insurance could violate industry standards of care and potentially lead to negligence claims. The removal of the adjective 'reputable and financially secure' also weakens the standard of care, increasing legal risk. This creates a potential omission of a duty of care, which can have liability implications.",

Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'will' with 'may' in the sentences related to 'maintain records', 'provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records' and 'retain such records' transforms a mandatory obligation into a discretionary one. Additionally, the removal of 'complete and accurate' and 'in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes' weakens the requirements for record-keeping. This omission introduces legal risk because it fails to ensure compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., FDA guidelines for drug development) and undermines the enforceability of intellectual property rights. In Delaware, failure to maintain adequate records can violate the duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it hinders the ability to verify compliance with the agreement and protect each party's interests.",

Recipient will take commercially reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Discloser. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient will take at least those measures that it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser in writing of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure, of Discloser's Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes aware.",

Recipient will notify Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes aware.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'will take commercially reasonable measures' with 'will endeavor to protect' significantly weakens the obligation to protect confidential information. The removal of 'and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use' reduces the scope of the protection. The sentence 'Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient will take at least those measures that it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature' is removed. The omission of 'promptly' before 'notify' introduces delay. These omissions creates legal risk because it weakens the standard of care expected in protecting confidential information. Under Delaware law, this can potentially result in claims for breach of contract and possibly trade secret misappropriation if the confidential information is a trade secret, as the diluted obligation may not be sufficient to meet the legal standards for reasonable measures to protect such information.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'sixty (60) days' to 'one hundred and eighty (180) days' weakens the policyholder's ability to quickly enforce their rights against AIG. Many states have prompt payment laws for insurance claims, requiring insurers to act within a reasonable timeframe. Delaying the period before a policyholder can take action could be construed as a violation of these laws, especially if the delay prejudices the policyholder's ability to recover funds in a timely manner. Texas insurance regulations, for example, may have specific timeframes that this change contradicts.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'in compliance with applicable law, including, without limitation, ... and any prior notice or approval requirements specified under applicable rules and regulations' eliminates the explicit requirement for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those requiring regulatory approval and notification. This omission could create a legal contradiction as insurance companies are heavily regulated and require specific regulatory approvals for capital contributions.",

Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that restricts AIG from terminating the agreement unless certain conditions regarding ratings or capital adequacy are met grants AIG an unrestricted right to terminate. Insurance regulations often require that any such agreements ensuring capital adequacy can only be terminated if the insurance company's financial stability is assured even after termination. By omitting these conditions, the agreement becomes potentially non-compliant with requirements aimed at protecting policyholders by ensuring ongoing capital support.",

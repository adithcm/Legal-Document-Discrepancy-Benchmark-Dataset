Quality\n9.1 Contractor shall permit Customer to audit its quality procedures, upon three (3) business day advance written notice to Contractor and shall provide all assistance which is reasonably necessary for Customer to evaluate the quality of the Products.\n9.2 Contractor shall maintain quality assurance standards in accordance with ISO 13488, Seller's Quality Assurance, Control and Inspection shall be in compliance with all material ISO 13488 standards during the Terms of this Agreement.",

Quality\n9.1 Contractor shall permit Customer to audit its quality procedures at the Contractor's discretion, and shall provide assistance that is reasonably convenient for Contractor to allow Customer to evaluate the quality of the Products.\n9.2 Contractor will attempt to adhere to industry quality assurance standards.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the ISO 13488 compliance requirement weakens the quality assurance obligations. Also, the modification to 9.1 weakens the customer's ability to audit the process. These changes introduces legal risk by potentially violating regulations related to manufacturing standards in Israel, where the contract is based.",

Contractor represents and warrants that, for the Warranty Period, the Products (i) will be free from defects in workmanship, material (only to the same extent as the original manufacturer of the material warrants the Contractor), and manufacture; (ii) will comply the Specifications IPC610.B standard (in all material respects and unless otherwise was instructed by Customer). Contractor further represents and warrants that the Product will consist of new materials. The warranty provided in this Section shall not apply to (1) Customer's materials, tooling and equipment (2) Products modified by Customer or any third party without Contractor's prior written consent, (2) Products installed or operated by Customer or any third party in a manner inconsistent with the Specifications or the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (3) Products damaged, abused, altered or misused by Customer or any third party, or as the result of fire, casualty, or other external cause (4) defects resulting directly or indirectly, wholly or partially, from Customer's Specifications or the design of the Products, (5) First articles, prototypes, pre-production units, test units or other similar Products. Upon any failure of a Product to comply with the above warranty, Contractor's sole obligation, and Customer's sole remedy, is for Contractor, at its option, to promptly repair or replace such Product and return it to Customer freight prepaid. Customer shall return Products covered by the warranty freight prepaid after completing a failure report and obtaining a return material authorization number from Contractor to be displayed on the shipping container. Customer shall bear all risks, costs and expenses, associated with Products that have been returned to Contractor for which there is no defect found and/or with Products not covered under the warranty above.",
                "changed_text": "10. Express Limited Warranty\nContractor warrants that the Products (i) will be free from significant defects in workmanship and manufacture at the time of delivery. This warranty shall not apply to (1) Customer's materials, tooling and equipment (2) Products modified by Customer or any third party without Contractor's prior written consent, (2) Products installed or operated by Customer or any third party in a manner inconsistent with the Specifications or the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (3) Products damaged, abused, altered or misused by Customer or any third party, or as the result of fire, casualty, or other external cause (4) defects resulting directly or indirectly, wholly or partially, from Customer's Specifications or the design of the Products, (5) First articles, prototypes, pre-production units, test units or other similar Products.

                "explanation": "Removing the specified warranty period (12 months) and the compliance with IPC610.B standard significantly weakens the warranty, reducing the customer's protection against defects. Eliminating 'material' from the first sentence, weakens the warranty. This can be a legal contradiction with Israeli law regarding product warranties, which may imply a reasonable warranty period even if not explicitly stated.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that limits the Contractor's liability to the amount they actually received weakens the overall limitation of liability clause. While limitations of liability are generally enforceable, some jurisdictions (including Israel) may not enforce them if they are deemed unconscionable or violate public policy. The original text had an additional protection for the contractor, limiting their liability to the amount they actually received, which is a common and often enforceable clause. Removing this introduces some legal risk as it makes the contractor more liable.",

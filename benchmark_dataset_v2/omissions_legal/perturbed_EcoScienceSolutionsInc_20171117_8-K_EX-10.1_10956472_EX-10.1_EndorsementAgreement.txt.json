                "explanation": "By removing the warranty that ESSI's products conform to all applicable laws and regulations, the contract introduces significant legal risk. This is especially relevant for dietary supplements, where compliance with FDA regulations is critical. The omission creates a loophole where ESSI is not explicitly guaranteeing adherence to product safety laws, potentially misleading Talent and exposing them to liability if the products are non-compliant.",

ESSI's products are, and will remain, merchantable and fit for the purpose for which they are intended.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit representation that ESSI's products conform to all applicable laws and regulations, the agreement shifts the risk of non-compliance onto Talent. This is particularly problematic as ESSI's products are in the health supplement space which are stringently regulated. This omission contradicts the general obligation under Michigan law for businesses to ensure that the products they sell conform with applicable statutes. The changed contract now fails to explicitly protect Talent from potential liabilities resulting from ESSI's legal non-compliance. Given this omission, the client (Talent) now has no legal basis under the agreement to assume ESSI's compliance with applicable regulatory statues.",

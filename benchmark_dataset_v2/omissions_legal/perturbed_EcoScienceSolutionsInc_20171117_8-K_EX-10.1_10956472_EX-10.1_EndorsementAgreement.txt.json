                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory disclaimer related to FDA evaluation of dietary supplements. Federal law requires specific disclaimers on dietary supplements; removing this requirement makes the contract non-compliant and increases the risk of misleading consumers.",

By removing the guarantee of compliance with laws and safety regulations, ESSI significantly reduces its liability and creates a contradiction with implied warranties and consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "This significantly reduces ESSI's indemnity obligations to Talent. The original clause provided broad indemnification for various liabilities, including product liability and infringement claims. The modified clause limits indemnification to direct damages from breach of contract and caps the liability at the fees paid to Talent. This omission contradicts the standard practice of broad indemnification in endorsement agreements and increases the legal risk for Talent, potentially conflicting with Michigan law regarding indemnification obligations.",

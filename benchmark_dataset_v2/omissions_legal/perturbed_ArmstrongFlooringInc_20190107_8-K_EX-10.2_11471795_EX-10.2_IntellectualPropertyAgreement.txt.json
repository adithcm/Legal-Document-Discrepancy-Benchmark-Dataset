                "original_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller's right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities.",
                "explanation": "By removing the quality assurance clause, the contract neglects to protect the trademark's integrity, potentially misleading consumers about the consistency and standards associated with the licensed trademarks. This omission can be considered deceptive trade practice under the Delaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which demands certain quality control standards for licensed products to protect consumers.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the clause mandating the Company's compliance with obligations applicable to Arizona under the Trademark License Agreement, including reporting complaints and adhering to quality control standards, creates a legal contradiction. By not explicitly requiring the Company to report complaints, the contract weakens consumer protection measures related to trademark usage. This introduces legal risk by potentially violating the Lanham Act, which emphasizes the importance of trademark owners ensuring consistent quality of goods and services associated with the mark.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of defending and holding harmless the other party and its affiliates, including employees, directors, and officers, and restricting the indemnification to only cover losses directly from a breach, the contract weakens the scope of protection available to the Indemnified Parties. This omission introduces legal risk under Delaware law regarding corporate officer and director liability. Delaware law provides certain protections and indemnification rights to corporate officers and directors, and weakening the indemnification clause could conflict with these implied legal protections.",

(b) The Company shall not tarnish or bring into disrepute the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Seller Licensed Trademarks or Arizona. (c) The Company shall use the Seller Licensed Trademarks at all times in compliance with all applicable Laws. (d) The Company shall include trademark and other notices in connection with the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks as reasonably requested by Arizona from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "The Buyer Entities acknowledge the importance of maintaining the Seller Licensed Trademarks, and accordingly: (a) The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks. (b) The Company shall not tarnish or bring into disrepute the reputation of or goodwill associated with the Seller Licensed Trademarks or Arizona.

(d) The Company may include trademark and other notices in connection with the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens Arizona's control over its trademarks. By removing the requirement that the Company's goods and services be of the same or greater quality as before the agreement, and weakening the compliance with all applicable laws, the contract now allows the company to degrade the quality of products bearing the trademarks and limit the amount of notices, which creates the potential for consumer deception and trademark infringement. The change introduces uncertainty, making the clause unenforceable.",

In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, the Company or Buyer may request permission from Arizona to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer institutes such Proceedings, Arizona may choose to cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the clear right of the Company or Buyer to independently pursue infringers of Arizona's Licensed Patents if Arizona declines to do so, instead requiring them to request permission. It also weakens Arizona's obligation to cooperate, making it optional. This creates a legal risk because it allows Arizona to effectively block the Company from protecting its interests in the licensed patents, potentially leading to antitrust issues or breach of implied duties.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the scope of indemnification. By removing the obligation to 'defend' and limiting the coverage to only 'losses' directly 'arising out of a breach,' it eliminates coverage for losses related to 'gross negligence or willful misconduct' and excludes 'all costs, liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses'. This creates a significant legal risk, particularly for the Buyer Entities, as they are now less protected against potential liabilities stemming from the Seller's actions related to the licensed intellectual property.",

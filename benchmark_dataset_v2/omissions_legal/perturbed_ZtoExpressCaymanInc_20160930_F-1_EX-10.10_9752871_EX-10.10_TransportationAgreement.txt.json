                "original_text": "Party B shall purchase sufficient insurance for the transportation vehicles. The coverage of third-party liability insurance shall not be lower than RMB1 million. In addition to vehicle personnel insurance, Party B shall at least purchase injury insurance for two persons with coverage not lower than RMB500,000 per person. Party B shall bear any consequence arising out of the non-compliance of insurance purchase, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall purchase insurance for the transportation vehicles. Party B shall bear any consequence arising out of the non-compliance of insurance purchase, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "explanation": "Removing the minimum insurance coverage requirements for third-party liability and injury insurance creates a legal contradiction. Chinese law mandates minimum insurance levels for commercial transportation, particularly regarding third-party liability to protect against potential damages caused by accidents. By omitting the specified minimum coverage, the contract fails to ensure compliance with these mandatory safety and compensation standards, potentially leaving victims of accidents involving Party B's vehicles without adequate recourse.",
                "contradicted_law": "Relevant laws and regulations in China mandating minimum insurance coverage for commercial vehicles, especially concerning third-party liability and employee injury insurance.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B may indemnify at a rate determined by Party B.",
                "explanation": "This omission weakens the compensation clause for damaged parcels. Chinese law provides guidelines for fair compensation based on the declared value or a reasonable assessment of the damage. By removing the defined compensation standards (RMB200 per parcel, actual price for high-end insured parcels) and granting Party B the sole discretion to determine the compensation rate, the contract contradicts consumer protection laws that require fair and predictable compensation for damaged goods during transportation.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the right to judicial review and gives Party A (Shipper) the sole and final authority to interpret any disputes. This contradicts fundamental principles of contract law in China (and most jurisdictions), which provide for impartial dispute resolution through courts or arbitration. By denying access to the courts, the contract violates legal principles ensuring fairness and due process in contractual disputes.",

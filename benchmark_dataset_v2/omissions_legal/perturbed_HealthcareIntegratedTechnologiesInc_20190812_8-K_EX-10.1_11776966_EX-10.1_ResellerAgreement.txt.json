Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is law in New York (specified in Section 14.7), these warranties are implied in the sale of goods unless explicitly disclaimed in a conspicuous manner, although this contract does not explicitly disclaim these. Omitting that the Supplier may make warranties weakens the consumer right to rely on those warranties, if made. Removing the clause relating to End User warranties further obscures warranty information, increasing legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,\" this clause attempts to broaden the liability limitations beyond what is legally permissible. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or certain types of damages, especially for consumer transactions. This creates a legal contradiction because the clause now purports to limit liability even in situations where the law might not allow it, especially in New York which is stated in Section 14.7. The removal of the aggregate liability cap also favors the Supplier, and removes consumer rights.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"to the fullest extent permitted by law,\" this clause now attempts to exclude all implied conditions and warranties, even those that cannot be legally excluded. In some jurisdictions, certain implied warranties (like the implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, if this product were used in a residential setting, or non-excludable implied warranties under consumer protection laws) cannot be waived or disclaimed. Omitting the language that acknowledges legal limitations on such exclusions creates a legal contradiction because the clause now purports to override mandatory legal provisions. This presents a consumer rights issue. Specifically, because the location is New York (Section 14.7), where there are specific consumer protection statutes. This violates common law since common law prevents unconscionable terms in the contract.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law principles regarding unconscionability and public policy; consumer protection statutes that prohibit the waiver of certain implied warranties; Uniform Commercial Code provisions that limit the ability to disclaim implied warranties in certain circumstances.",

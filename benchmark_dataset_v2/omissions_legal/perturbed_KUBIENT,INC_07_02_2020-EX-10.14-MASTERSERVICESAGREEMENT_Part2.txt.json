                "original_text": "During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule. Provided however, this provision shall not apply in the event Customer can establish, in writing, that it had a preexisting working relationship with such Third-Party prior to the Agreement and without Kubient's assistance. Customer acknowledges that this provision is reasonable and necessary for the protection of Kubient and that Kubient will be irrevocably damaged if such covenant is not specifically enforced. Customer further agrees that Kubient will be entitled to seek injunctive relief for the purpose of restraining Customer from violating this covenant (and no bond or other security shall be required in connection therewith) in addition to any other relief to which Kubient may be entitled under the Agreement.",

Customer further agrees that Kubient will be entitled to seek injunctive relief for the purpose of restraining Customer from violating this covenant in addition to any other relief to which Kubient may be entitled under the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause allowing the customer to work with pre-existing third-party relationships, even if introduced by Kubient, this creates an overly broad non-circumvention clause. Many states have laws protecting existing business relationships and restricting overly broad non-compete agreements. This change introduces a legal risk that the non-circumvention clause could be deemed unenforceable.",

During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer shall not, whether for its own account or for the account of any other person or entity, interfere with the relationship of Kubient with, or endeavor to entice away from Kubient, any person or entity who was or is a an employee or Third-Party of Kubient.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'prior written consent' clause for non-solicitation and interference with business relationships, the contract now absolutely prohibits the customer from any of these actions, regardless of the circumstances. This is an overly broad restriction that conflicts with state laws requiring reasonable limitations on non-solicitation clauses. This introduces a legal risk that this clause would be deemed an unreasonable restraint of trade.",

                "explanation": "By removing the exception for new \"Direct Deals\" introduced by Kubient that generate Net Revenue from the contract the company violates the possibility of introducing more profits to Kubient, and this is related to income and profit generation for the company. This type of deals can be considered the main source of income and removing that exception limits revenue growth",

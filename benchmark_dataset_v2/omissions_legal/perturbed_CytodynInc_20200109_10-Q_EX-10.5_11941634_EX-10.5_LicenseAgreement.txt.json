                "original_text": "Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'comprehensive', 'reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement', 'prompt' and 'non-renewal or material change' as well as 'within thirty (30) days after any such non-renewal or material change' weakens the insurance requirement and notice provisions, creating legal risk. The changes could permit a party to maintain inadequate insurance coverage or fail to provide timely notice of significant changes, potentially violating general principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing, as well as potentially breaching specific state insurance regulations that might require certain minimum coverage levels or notification periods.",

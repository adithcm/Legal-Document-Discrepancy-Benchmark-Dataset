                "original_text": "13.4 Insurance. Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive', 'product liability' and 'other appropriate insurance', and the phrase about maintaining insurance from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations significantly reduces the level of insurance required. The removal of the time constraint on insurance obligations following commercialization undermines long-term risk mitigation. This introduces legal risk because standard business practice and legal requirements often mandate comprehensive and product liability insurance to cover potential damages arising from the product's use. Omitting these details could result in insufficient coverage, violating basic risk management and potentially applicable state liability laws. Furthermore, failure to maintain appropriate insurance levels in pharmaceutical commercialization can violate FDA regulations.",

Within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date the Parties will enter into the Pharmacovigilance Agreement, setting forth guidelines and procedures for the receipt, investigation, recording, review, post-marketing surveillance, communication, reporting and exchange between the Parties of adverse event reports, technical complaints and any other information concerning the safety of the Licensed Products. Vyera shall be responsible for promptly (and in any event in sufficient time to permit CytoDyn to comply with its legal and regulatory reporting obligations) providing to CytoDyn any and all information relating to adverse events, including, without limitation, Serious Adverse Events, that comes into its possession.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase regarding Vyera's responsibility to promptly provide CytoDyn with information relating to adverse events significantly weakens the adverse event reporting process. This is a legal contradiction because pharmaceutical companies have a legal obligation to thoroughly and promptly report all adverse events to regulatory authorities. By removing Vyera's explicit responsibility to provide this information, the contract creates a loophole that could impede accurate and timely reporting, posing a significant legal risk and potential violation of FDA regulations. Specifically, not ensuring Vyera shares information promptly contradicts 21 CFR 314.80 and 21 CFR 600.80, which mandate prompt reporting of adverse drug experiences and biological product deviations.",

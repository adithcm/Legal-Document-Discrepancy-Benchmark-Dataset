                "original_text": "1.49 \"Independent Ethics Committee\" or \"IEC\" means an independent body (a review board or a committee, institutional, regional, national, or supranational), constituted of medical professionals and non-medical members, whose responsibility it is to ensure the protection of the rights, safety and well-being of human subjects involved in a trial and to provide public assurance of that protection, by, among other things, reviewing and approving / providing favorable opinion on, the trial protocol, the suitability of the investigator(s), facilities, and the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. The legal status,\ncomposition, function, operations and regulatory requirements pertaining to IEC may differ among countries, but should allow the Independent Ethics Committee to act in agreement with GCP as described in this guideline.",
                "changed_text": "1.49 \"Independent Ethics Committee\" or \"IEC\" means a body that may review trial protocols, the suitability of investigators and facilities, and the methods and material used in obtaining consent from trial subjects. The specific function and regulatory requirements pertaining to the IEC will be determined by Green Cross.",
                "explanation": "The original text accurately describes the role and responsibilities of an IEC, ensuring the safety and rights of clinical trial participants, which is a legal requirement in most jurisdictions, including South Korea. The modified version removes key aspects such as the mandatory composition of medical and non-medical members, the primary responsibility for protecting subjects' rights and well-being, and public assurance of protection. By stating that the function and regulatory requirements of the IEC will be determined by Green Cross, the contract creates a loophole where Green Cross could potentially undermine the independence and effectiveness of the IEC, violating regulations that mandate independent ethical review of clinical trials.",

It also discusses the potential risks and benefits associated with participation, including all available data on previous studies. The ICF must be signed by the patient or authorized caregiver before entrance is granted into a study.",
                "changed_text": "1.52 \"Informed Consent Form\" or \"ICF\" means a document that discusses the potential risks and benefits associated with participation. The ICF should be acknowledged by the patient before entrance is granted into a study.",
                "explanation": "The original text correctly describes an Informed Consent Form (ICF) as a document that outlines a patient's rights and the risks and benefits. The modified version omits the critical requirement that the ICF must outline a patient's rights during participation. Removing the 'patient's rights' and replacing 'must be signed' with 'should be acknowledged' significantly weakens the requirement for informed consent, creating a legal loophole and contravening the principles of GCP and South Korean clinical trial regulations that mandate explicit outlining of patient rights. The original text requires all available data from previous studies to be given to the patients. The new omission does not require it to give this data.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation omits the explicit mention of compliance with 'all applicable GLP, GCP and applicable cGMP requirements, including, without limitation those specified by the ICH' standards for Development activities. Replacing the term \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" with \"reasonable efforts\" weakens the obligation and removes the implicit requirement to adhere to the standards that the pharmaceutical industry would normally uphold. This introduces a legal risk, as these standards are legally mandated to ensure data integrity, patient safety, and product quality during drug development in South Korea and worldwide. The omission makes the contract non-compliant by creating a potential loophole to avoid strict adherence to these legally mandated practices.",

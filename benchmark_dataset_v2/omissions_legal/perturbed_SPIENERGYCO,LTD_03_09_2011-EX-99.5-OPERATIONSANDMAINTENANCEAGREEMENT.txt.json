                "explanation": "The removal of specific coverage amounts for Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability and Worker's Compensation weakens the insurance requirements and fails to comply with standard business practices and potentially CA state regulations which mandate minimum liability coverage to protect against potential damages and injuries.

(f) Payment of Deductible. The payment of any deductible for any insurance required pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be the responsibility of Service Provider, unless the loss covered by such insurance is caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Owner, its officers, directors, agents, employees, and assigns, in which case the deductible shall be paid by Owner.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement that the Service Provider's insurance be primary and not excess to insurance held by Owner, User, and their affiliates, and excluding User, User's Landlord or subsequent owners as additional insureds, undermines the risk allocation agreed to by the parties, and could increase the liability of the Owner and User. Deleting the exception for deductible payments when the loss is caused by Owner's negligence removes an equitable protection for the Service Provider. These omissions may conflict with typical insurance requirements for commercial operations in California.",

                "explanation": "Deleting the explicit reference to the laws of the State of California and replacing it with the laws of contract undermines the consumer protections afforded under California state law. Omitting the clause requiring performance in accordance with 'applicable laws' removes an explicit requirement to adhere to legal standards, potentially allowing for practices that violate consumer protection laws or other regulatory requirements. This poses a legal risk because the contract could be interpreted to permit actions that would otherwise be illegal under California law.",

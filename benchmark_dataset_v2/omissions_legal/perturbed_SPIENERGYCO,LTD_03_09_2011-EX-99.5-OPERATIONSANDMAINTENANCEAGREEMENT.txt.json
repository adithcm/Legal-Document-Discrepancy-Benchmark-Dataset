                "explanation": "California law mandates both worker's compensation insurance and a minimum level of employer's liability insurance. By removing the employer's liability insurance requirement, the contract becomes non-compliant with California labor laws.",

                "explanation": "California law often implies a waiver of subrogation rights in construction and commercial contracts to protect property owners and other stakeholders. By making the waiver optional ('may request') instead of mandatory ('shall require'), the contract potentially violates implied protections and increases Owner's liability risk. This is particularly relevant given the location of the SEF in Rancho Cordova, CA.",

                "explanation": "California law requires contracts to be performed in accordance with all applicable laws. Removing the sentence stating “The parties agree to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement in accordance with applicable laws.”, increases the legal risk and contradicts mandatory obligations to follow the law.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to the Northern California Chapter beginning on the first full quarter [three (3) month period] of the Agreement and continue on a quarterly basis thereafter for the term of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By changing the dispersal of funds to the NFL Alumni Northern California Chapter to be 'at the Company's discretion,' the contract introduces ambiguity and allows the company to potentially avoid or delay the legally required donation. This could be construed as a breach of charitable trust and potentially violates California's laws regarding charitable donations and transparency for charitable organizations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the obligation for the company to provide quarterly sales reports to the NFLA-NC eliminates a crucial transparency measure. This directly contradicts the requirements for accountability expected of charitable donations, particularly in California where non-profits must maintain financial records and make them available for inspection as outlined by the IRS. This lack of transparency creates a legal risk as it inhibits the NFLA-NC's ability to ensure the correct donation amount is being calculated and paid, which is a required standard for the management of charitable funds.",

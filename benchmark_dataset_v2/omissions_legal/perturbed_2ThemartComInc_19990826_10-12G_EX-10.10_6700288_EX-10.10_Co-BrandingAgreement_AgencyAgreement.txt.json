Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement conflict with the California Escrow Law, its rules or regulations, which govern i-Escrow's business practices, the California Escrow Law shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time that i-Escrow reasonably believes such a conflict exists, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",

Should any of the terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement appear to conflict with any law, rule, or regulation, i-Escrow will give 2TheMart written notice of such conflict and the parties will use their best efforts to resolve such conflict.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation for i-Escrow to strictly adhere to California Escrow Law. By replacing the explicit requirement to comply with California Escrow Law with 'reasonable efforts' and removing the clause that the California Escrow Law shall prevail, the contract now potentially allows i-Escrow to deviate from mandatory legal requirements. This introduces a legal risk because it may not ensure full compliance with consumer protection laws related to escrow services.",

Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of ten percent (10%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",

Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for 'proper records and books of account,' the specific timeframe for keeping records (one year), the right to audit by a CPA, the fifteen-day notice period, the two-week payment period for overdue amounts, and the clause regarding i-Escrow paying for the audit if overdue payments exceed 10%, the contract weakens 2TheMart's ability to effectively audit i-Escrow's financial records. This creates a legal contradiction because it reduces the transparency and accountability necessary to comply with fair business practices and potentially violates regulations requiring accurate financial reporting.",

In addition, 2TheMart shall indemnify i-Escrow against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which i-Escrow may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from 2TheMart Content.  In addition, i-Escrow shall indemnify 2TheMart against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which 2TheMart may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from i-Escrow Content and or the Services provided to Customers.  The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the Indemnified Party: (i) giving the Indemnifying Party notice of the relevant claim, (ii) cooperating with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of such claim, and (iii) giving the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that affects the Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval.

                "explanation": "By removing specific mentions of 'reasonable attorneys' fees,' limiting indemnity to actions (omitting omissions and misrepresentations), and deleting the specific indemnity obligations related to 2TheMart Content and i-Escrow Content, this weakens the indemnification protection for both parties. Furthermore, removing conditions (ii) and (iii) relating to cooperation and control of defense removes the ability for the Indemnifying Party to properly manage the defense.

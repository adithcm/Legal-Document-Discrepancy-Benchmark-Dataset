                "explanation": "Removing the obligation to perform daily backups and retrieve lost information weakens data security and recovery safeguards. Under Spanish data protection laws (Ley Orgánica 3/2018, de Protección de Datos Personales y garantía de los derechos digitales), companies are required to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including regular backups and data recovery processes. By removing the mandatory daily backup, this contract introduces non-compliance with data protection regulations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the line 'EIT will be responsible for the behaviour and tasks of this team, especially on what concerns the confidentiality of the information,' the contract weakens the protection of confidential information and reduces EIT's responsibility. Under Spanish law, particularly concerning data protection (Ley Orgánica 3/2018), companies are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of personal data processed on their behalf. This omission introduces a potential legal risk by reducing the clear responsibility for data confidentiality, potentially violating data protection regulations.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'or to third parties' and weakening the responsibility statement by using 'may be', the contract reduces EIT's liability. Under Spanish contract law (Código Civil), parties are generally liable for damages caused by their breach of contract. Limiting liability only to the Customer and making responsibility discretionary undermines this principle, creating potential legal issues. This change can be seen as an abusive clause that is not in accordance with the law. ",

                "original_text": "AJR shall have no liability for any damage to or loss of the wearable computers issued to AJR under this Agreement, except to the extent such damage or loss results from the intentional abuse of the equipment by AJR personnel.",
                "changed_text": "AJR shall have no liability for any damage to or loss of the wearable computers issued to AJR under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the exception for damage or loss resulting from intentional abuse, the contract attempts to absolve AJR of liability even for intentional damage. This is a legal contradiction because it conflicts with the general principle that parties are responsible for damages resulting from their intentional acts, a basic tenet of tort law and commercial law.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the reimbursement of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, to the prevailing party. By changing 'shall' to 'may,' the modified text makes reimbursement discretionary. This introduces legal risk because it undermines the predictability of the agreement, potentially violating basic principles of contract enforcement, which generally aim to provide a clear remedy for breach.",

In the event of any such delay or failure, XC or AJR, as applicable, shall immediately furnish written notice thereof and the reason therefor to the other party. The performance of XC or AJR, as applicable shall be deemed suspended so long as and to the extent that any such Event Force Majeure continues. XC or AJR, as the case may be, shall use its best efforts to cure or correct any such Event of Force Majeure and resume performance of its duties and obligations hereunder, within the shortest period of time possible.",

The performance of XC or AJR, as applicable shall be deemed suspended so long as any such Event Force Majeure continues.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the 'principally' qualifier, the removal of the requirement to 'immediately furnish written notice thereof and the reason therefor to the other party' and the removal of the 'best efforts' clause significantly weakens the force majeure provision. Under common law contract principles, especially in Virginia, a party invoking force majeure must demonstrate that the event was unforeseeable and that they took reasonable steps to mitigate its impact. Removing the 'best efforts' clause and the notification requirement weakens the obligation to mitigate, creating a potential legal contradiction with common law principles regarding force majeure.",

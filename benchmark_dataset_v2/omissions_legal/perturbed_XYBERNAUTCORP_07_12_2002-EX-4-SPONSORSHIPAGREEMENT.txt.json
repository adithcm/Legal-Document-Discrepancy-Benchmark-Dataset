                "original_text": "AJR shall have no liability for any damage to or loss of the wearable computers issued to AJR under this Agreement, except to the extent such damage  or loss  results  from the  intentional  abuse of the  equipment  by AJR personnel.",
                "changed_text": "AJR shall have no liability for any damage to or loss of the wearable computers issued to AJR under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'except to the extent such damage or loss results from the intentional abuse of the equipment by AJR personnel' creates a blanket waiver of liability, even in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. This violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Virginia contracts, as it allows AJR to potentially damage or destroy the equipment without consequence, undermining the purpose of providing the equipment for promotional use. Virginia law generally holds parties responsible for damages resulting from their intentional or grossly negligent acts.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement and all acts and transactions hereunder shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'without regard to any of its conflicts of laws principles which would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction' introduces ambiguity and potential conflict. Without this clause, a court might apply another state's laws if Virginia's conflict of laws principles dictate it. This could result in consumer rights being affected based on different state laws and cause a legal contradiction. For example, if a consumer protection law in Florida (where AJR is located) is more favorable to the company, a court applying conflict of law principles might choose Florida law, thus harming the company.",

However, in many consumer-related lawsuits, attorney's fees are awarded to the prevailing consumer. By removing this clause, the contract potentially disadvantages the consumer by preventing them from recovering legal costs if they win, which violates consumer protection principles.",

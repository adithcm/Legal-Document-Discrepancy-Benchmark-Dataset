                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached. Amendments to this agreement may be subject to further agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) and stating that amendments may be subject to further agreement, the contract omits the legally required process for amending joint filing agreements as dictated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This creates a loophole where parties may attempt to bypass SEC regulations.",

                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed. Counterparts will have the same legal consideration.",
                "explanation": "By removing the statement that each counterpart shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument, the contract creates ambiguity regarding the legal status of the various signed copies. This could lead to disputes about which version of the agreement is binding, going against standard contract law principles that ensure enforceability and clarity.",

                "changed_text": "The execution and filing of this agreement does not automatically indicate group status.",
                "explanation": "The changed text weakens the original statement. The original states that the agreement 'shall not be construed as an admission'. The modified version only says it 'does not automatically indicate'. This subtly implies that under certain circumstances, the agreement *could* be used as an admission of group status, thereby creating ambiguity that could contradict SEC regulations regarding disclosures and group formations.",

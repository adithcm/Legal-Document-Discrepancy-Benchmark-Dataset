                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance coverage levels and notification periods for changes to the insurance policies. Removing the minimum coverage amounts for employer's liability and commercial general liability insurance and the notification period significantly weakens the protection for the Owner and introduces a legal contradiction. Delaware law mandates specific insurance coverage and notice periods in construction contracts to protect owners. By omitting these requirements, the contract becomes non-compliant and increases legal risk.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly assigns the responsibility for 'maintaining and complying with all Permits' to the Operator at their sole expense. This ensures that the operation adheres to all legal and regulatory requirements, which protects the Owner from potential liabilities. The modified version weakens this obligation by changing the phrase to 'Operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain compliance with applicable permits.' The phrase 'commercially reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity. By weakening the Operator's obligation and making the Owner's assistance optional, the amended clause introduces a legal contradiction with Delaware's environmental regulations and permitting requirements, creating potential risks for both parties.",

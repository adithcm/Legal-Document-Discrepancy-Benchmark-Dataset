                "explanation": "Removing the explicit requirement for informed consent violates ethical and legal standards for clinical research in the United States. The Common Rule (45 CFR 46) mandates informed consent for human subjects in research, and omitting this representation creates a legal risk for ArTara. The FDA also requires informed consent as a prerequisite for using clinical trial data in regulatory submissions.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for the insurance carrier to notify the University of cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage, along with the University's right to terminate the agreement if comparable replacement insurance isn't obtained, weakens the University's protection. This omission introduces a legal risk by failing to ensure continuous insurance coverage, which is a standard practice in agreements involving potential liabilities. Without this notification, the University may unknowingly be exposed to uncovered liabilities.",

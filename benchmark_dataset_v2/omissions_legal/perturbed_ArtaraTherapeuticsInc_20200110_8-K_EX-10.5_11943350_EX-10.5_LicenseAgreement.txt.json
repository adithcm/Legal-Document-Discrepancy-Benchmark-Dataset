                "original_text": "7.1 ArTara, Affiliates, and sublicensees will obtain and maintain commercial general liability insurance with a reputable and financially secure insurance carrier prior to clinical testing, making, using, importing, offering to sell, or selling any licensed Product or engaging in any other act involving any licensed Product or the patent rights, if such act could possibly create risk of a claim against University Indemnitees for personal injury or property damage. (a) The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds and will provide that the carrier will notify University in writing at least […***…] prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage. Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such […***…] period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the […***…] period without notice or any additional cure period. (b) The insurance will include coverage for product liability with a minimum of […***…] dollars ($[…***…]) per occurrence and […***…] dollars ($[…***…]) annual aggregate, coverage for contractual liability, clinical trials liability if any such trial is performed, bodily injury and property damage, including completed operations, personal injury, coverage for contractual employees, blanket contractual and products, and all other coverages standard for such policies. Such insurance will additionally include errors and omissions insurance with a minimum of […***…] dollars ($[…***…]) per occurrence. (c) Insurance policies purchased to comply with this Article Seven will be kept in force for at least […***…] after the last sale of licensed Product.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for 'commercial' and 'reputable and financially secure' insurance carriers weakens the protection for the University. Deleting the notification requirement prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage removes a critical safeguard. The elimination of specified minimum coverage amounts for product liability and errors and omissions significantly reduces the University's financial protection. Shortening the period in which the insurance needs to be kept in force after the last sale of licensed product is also a big shift of when responsibility is on University. These omissions collectively create a legal contradiction with standard business practices and potentially with Iowa state law regarding adequate insurance coverage in commercial agreements.",

(b) The Program is being and has been conducted in accordance with all applicable medical privacy laws or regulations, including without limitation, by obtaining any required subject informed consent to allow ArTara and ArTara's authorized representatives, FDA and other Regulatory Authorities access to and use of enrolled subjects' medical information as may be necessary for ArTara to receive and use Program Data under this Agreement.

(d) University represents that consent was required from subjects prior to enrollment in the Program, and that the Program was reviewed by an ethics board.",
                "explanation": "Modifying 'all applicable' to 'general accordance' weakens the commitment to specific laws like the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and GCPs. Removing 'without limitation, by obtaining any required subject informed consent' eliminates the explicit guarantee of informed consent and access to medical information. Changing 'Institutional Review Board' to 'ethics board' can be misleading if the board doesn't meet IRB standards. The modifications introduce potential non-compliance with federal regulations related to clinical trials and patient privacy, creating legal risks for the project.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'To the extent permitted by law' implies unlimited indemnification, which is unusual and potentially unenforceable. Removing the extensive list of 'University Indemnitees' significantly reduces the scope of protection. Eliminating 'loss, expense, reasonable adjudicated attorneys' fees, or claims for injury or damages' limits the types of liabilities covered. Changing 'negligent or acts or omissions' to 'direct actions' narrows the scope of ArTara's responsibility. The omission of 'in proportion to and to the extent' eliminates the proportional liability clause, potentially assigning ArTara full responsibility for damages even if partially caused by others. These changes severely weaken the University's indemnification protection, which may violate standard legal expectations and expose the University to greater risk.",

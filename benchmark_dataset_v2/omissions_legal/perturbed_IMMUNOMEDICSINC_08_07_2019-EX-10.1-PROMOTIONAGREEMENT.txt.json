Company shall ensure that the Sales Representatives and Other Company Employees Promote the Product at all times in accordance with applicable Laws and the Promotional Materials provided and approved by Janssen, refrain from making any false or misleading statements about the Product and refrain from discussing any unapproved uses of the Product.",

Company shall ensure that the Sales Representatives and Other Company Employees Promote the Product at all times in accordance with the Promotional Materials provided and approved by Janssen, refrain from making any false or misleading statements about the Product and refrain from discussing any unapproved uses of the Product.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement for Company personnel to comply with 'all applicable Laws.' By omitting this requirement, the contract introduces a potential legal contradiction as pharmaceutical promotion is heavily regulated, and compliance with laws is mandatory. This introduces legal risk.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'appropriate, in accordance with the applicable Laws,' eliminates a critical safeguard. Sales incentive programs in the pharmaceutical industry are subject to anti-kickback statutes and other regulations. This omission creates a potential for incentives that violate these laws.",

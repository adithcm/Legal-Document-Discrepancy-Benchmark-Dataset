                "changed_text": "",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'such other longer period as required by law', the contract now potentially violates UK employment law, specifically the Employment Rights Act 1996, which mandates minimum notice periods based on length of service that may be longer than the 6 weeks specified in 2.1.1. This omission introduces a legal risk as the contract might not comply with statutory minimums, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'subject to deductions required by law,' the contract could be interpreted as attempting to circumvent legally mandated deductions such as income tax and national insurance contributions, violating UK tax laws and employment regulations.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'intends to comply' to 'may comply', the contract creates ambiguity regarding the company's commitment to fulfilling its legal obligations under the Pensions Act 2008. This act mandates employer pension contributions; weakening this statement introduces a legal risk of non-compliance with pension regulations.",

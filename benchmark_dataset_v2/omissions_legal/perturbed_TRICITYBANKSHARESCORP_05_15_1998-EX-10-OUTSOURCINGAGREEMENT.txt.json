                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Throughout the Term of this Agreement, M&I shall maintain at all times at its own cost and expense:\n\n               1.   Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its premises, including bodily injury, property damage, broad form contractual liability and independent contractors, with primary limits of not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000).\n\n               2.   Fidelity Insurance covering employee dishonesty with respect to all aspects of the Services, in an amount not less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).\n\n               3.   Workers' Compensation Insurance as mandated or allowed by the state in which the Services are being performed, including at least five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) coverage for Employer's Liability.\n\n               4.   All Risk Property Insurance in an amount adequate to cover the cost of replacement of all equipment, improvements, and betterments at M&I locations in the event of loss or damage.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the Term of this Agreement, M&I shall maintain insurance coverage. The specifics of the coverage, including types and limits, will be determined at M&I's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the specific types and minimum amounts of insurance coverage M&I is required to maintain. Removing the Commercial General Liability Insurance, Fidelity Insurance, Workers' Compensation Insurance, and All Risk Property Insurance requirements, along with their specified coverage amounts, makes the contract non-compliant with standard business practices and potentially violates laws requiring specific insurance coverage for businesses of this type. This creates significant legal risk, especially concerning liability and worker protection.",
                "contradicted_law": "General business liability laws and worker's compensation laws in Wisconsin, and potentially banking regulations related to operational risk management.",

Thereafter, M&I shall schedule implementation of the changes prior to the deadline imposed by the regulatory or other governmental agency having jurisdiction for such change.  M&I's obligation to meet the compliance deadline shall be contingent upon M&I receiving timely notice from Customer or any other service bureau customer of M&I so as to enable M&I to schedule and implement such change prior to the regulatory deadline.  M&I shall implement such change at Customer's sole cost and expense (shared equitably among all of M&I's other service bureau customers who are affected by such change).",
                "changed_text": "Customer may inform M&I of changes in state law. M&I will consider these changes and may implement them at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation for M&I to schedule and implement changes in state law necessary for compliance, instead giving M&I complete discretion over whether or not to implement such changes. This introduces legal risk as the contract no longer guarantees regulatory compliance, potentially leading to legal violations and penalties for the Customer.",

                "changed_text": "Customer may be responsible for costs associated with regulatory examinations at M&I's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'reasonable costs actually incurred' and 'solely for the purpose of examining Services used by Customer' language, the modified text creates ambiguity and shifts cost control to M&I. This omission opens the door for M&I to potentially charge the customer for costs not directly related to the examination of their specific services or unreasonable expenses incurred, potentially violating regulations aimed at protecting bank customers from unfair or hidden fees.",

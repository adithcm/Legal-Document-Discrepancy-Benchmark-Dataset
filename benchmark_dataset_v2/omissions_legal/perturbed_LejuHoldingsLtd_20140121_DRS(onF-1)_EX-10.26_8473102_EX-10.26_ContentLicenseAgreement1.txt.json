                "explanation": "By removing 'all applicable' and replacing it with 'commercially reasonable efforts', the contract weakens Licensee's obligation to comply with the law. Also removing 'operation' and 'use of the Licensed Domain Names and Licensed Content in connection therewith' provides loopholes. This contradicts consumer protection laws in the PRC, which require strict adherence to all applicable laws regarding business operations and advertising. This omission shifts the responsibility from strict compliance to a more ambiguous and less stringent standard.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'the same degree of care that it exercises with its own confidential information, and in no event less than' weakens the standard of care required for protecting confidential information. It removes the requirement to protect confidential information with at least the same level of care as the recipient's own confidential information, potentially leading to inadequate protection and breaches of confidentiality. This could contradict intellectual property and trade secret protection laws in the PRC, which often require a higher standard of care.",

                "explanation": "By removing the obligation to submit the dispute to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, as well as removing 'to be finally settled' introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of dispute resolution. Also changing 'shall' to 'may' weakens the obligation to use Mandarin Chinese. This could potentially conflict with PRC laws that favor or mandate specific arbitration processes for certain types of commercial disputes, particularly those involving foreign entities.",

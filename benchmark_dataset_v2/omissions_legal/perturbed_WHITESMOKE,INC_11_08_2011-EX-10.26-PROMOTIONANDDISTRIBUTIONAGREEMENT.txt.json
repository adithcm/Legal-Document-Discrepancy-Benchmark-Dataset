In connection with Distributor's distribution of the Products under this Agreement, and before the Google Toolbar or Chrome  Browser can be installed by an End User, Distributor shall provide each End User with: (a) a clear statement inviting the End User to agree  to the terms of the applicable EULA; (b) the opportunity for each End User to review such EULA via a hyperlink to such EULA: and (c) a button on which each End User may click indicating agreement to the  terms of such EULA. In the event that an End User does not affirmatively agree to install the Google Toolbar or Chrome Browser, by  clicking on the button to agree to the terms of the applicable EULA, then the Google Toolbar or Chrome Browser (as applicable) shall not  be installed on such End User's computer.",

In connection with Distributor's distribution of the Products under this Agreement, Distributor may provide each End User with a statement inviting the End User to review the terms of the applicable EULA. The installation of the Google Toolbar or Chrome Browser shall proceed at the distributor's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a clear statement inviting agreement, the hyperlink to the EULA, and the explicit consent button, this clause undermines consumer protection laws that require informed consent before software installation. This is especially important when bundled software is involved. Deleting the explicit opt-in requirement and replacing it with distributor discretion creates legal risk.",

                "explanation": "By replacing a limited warranty with an 'as is' disclaimer, this clause eliminates the implied warranty of merchantability. This contradicts consumer protection laws, like the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in the US, that ensure products meet basic quality standards and are fit for their intended purpose. Omitting any form of warranty shifts all risk to the distributor.",

However, Google shall not be liable for any liabilities, costs, damages, or expenses incurred by Distributor in connection with such IP Claim.",
                "explanation": "Replacing a mandatory indemnification clause with a discretionary assistance clause significantly reduces Google's legal responsibility for intellectual property infringement claims. This weakens distributor protection, potentially violating laws related to product liability and intellectual property rights. This introduces legal risk, particularly if the distributor faces substantial legal costs due to infringement by the Google product.",

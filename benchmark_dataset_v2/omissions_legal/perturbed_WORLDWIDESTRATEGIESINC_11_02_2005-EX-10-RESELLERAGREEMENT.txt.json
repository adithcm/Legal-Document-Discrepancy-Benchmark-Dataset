At a minimum, Reseller will subscribe for and maintain during the Term and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, commercial general liability insurance and errors and omission insurance in minimum amounts of Two Million Dollars (US$2,000,000) per occurrence. Reseller will cause its insurance agent or broker to issue and deliver to TouchStar certified copies of certificates evidencing that insurance coverage of the required types and limits are in full force and effect. Reseller will ensure that any persons or entities engaged by or employed by it will carry and maintain such insurance coverage. Each policy will include a provision requiring notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to any cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification of the policy and will require that each policy will name TouchStar as an additional insured.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'minimum amounts of Two Million Dollars (US$2,000,000) per occurrence' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the annual proof requirement eliminates an important compliance measure. This creates a legal contradiction with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial enterprises. The removal of the notification requirement of cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification weakens TouchStar's ability to protect itself. All these omissions violate basic business laws and regulations and are material contradictions.",

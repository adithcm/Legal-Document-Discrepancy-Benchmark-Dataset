                "original_text": "Each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term and for five (5) years after the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including products liability insurance, with minimum \"A-\" AM Best rated insurance carriers, in each case with limits of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate. All deductibles/retentions will be the responsibility of the named insured. Pfizer and its Affiliates will be an additional insured on Exact's commercial general liability and products liability policies, and be provided with a waiver of subrogation. To the extent of its culpability, all coverages of Exact will be primary and non-contributing with any similar insurance carried by Pfizer. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.2 to the contrary, Pfizer may meet its obligations under this Section 6.2 through self-insurance.",

                "explanation": "By removing the minimum rating requirement ('A-' AM Best rated insurance carriers'), the specific coverage limits (five million dollars per occurrence and in the aggregate), the additional insured status for Pfizer, the waiver of subrogation, the provision ensuring Exact's coverage is primary, and the coverage after the term, the contract introduces a significant loophole. This could violate standard business practice and potentially state laws requiring specific insurance coverage in commercial contracts. Removing the obligation to maintain insurance coverage for five years after the term could violate state laws regarding liability for products sold during the term but causing harm afterward. These omissions create legal risk.",

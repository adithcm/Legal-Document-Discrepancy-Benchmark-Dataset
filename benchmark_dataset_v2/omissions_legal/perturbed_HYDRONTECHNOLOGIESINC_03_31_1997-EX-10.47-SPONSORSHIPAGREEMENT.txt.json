The Dolphins shall, at its own expense, maintain in effect throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance policies with carriers of recognized standing, with limits of liability of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), governing any and all property damage and person injury (including death) arising out of activities covered by this Agreement. Hydron shall, at its own expense, maintain in effect throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance policies with carriers of recognized standing, with limits of liability of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), covering any and all property damage and personal injury (including death) arising out of activities covered by this Agreement and shall obtain and maintain such additional insurance coverage as the Dolphins shall reasonably require with respect to any Sponsored Events or similar activities.",

Hydron shall maintain general liability insurance policies throughout the term of this Agreement and shall obtain additional insurance coverage as the Dolphins require with respect to any Sponsored Events.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for 'comprehensive' coverage and specifying minimum liability limits significantly weakens the insurance obligation on both parties. It is common practice, and often legally implied, for commercial entities to maintain adequate insurance. Removing the minimum limits and details weakens the protection for both parties in case of significant liabilities, creating a contradiction with typical commercial risk management expectations and potentially leaving them exposed to uncovered losses that would typically be insured. This introduces legal risk for both parties, particularly if state law or common business practices suggest a higher standard of insurance is appropriate.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the prevailing party's right to recover legal expenses, this modification contradicts Florida Statute ยง 57.105, which allows for the recovery of attorney's fees in contract disputes under certain conditions. This alteration discourages parties from pursuing legitimate claims due to the potential financial burden, thus creating a legal contradiction by eliminating a statutory right to fee recovery in specific circumstances.",

                "explanation": "Florida law provides specific protections and rights within its jurisdiction. By allowing the plaintiff to select the governing law and venue at the time of filing suit, the agreement undermines the predictability and fairness of legal proceedings. This omission contradicts the principle that parties should have a reasonable expectation regarding the laws and forum applicable to their agreement, and it introduces uncertainty that could prejudice one party over the other. This also creates a situation where it is possible to use law that is less protective of Florida consumers, which is a legal contradiction.",

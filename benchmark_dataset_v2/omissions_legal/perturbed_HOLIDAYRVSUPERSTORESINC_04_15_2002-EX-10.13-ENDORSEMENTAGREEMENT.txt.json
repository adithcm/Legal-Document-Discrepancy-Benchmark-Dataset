                "original_text": "A. AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party. If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, AGI will defend such claim at its expense and will indemnify the Company, its agents and representatives, for all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of such claim. The Company hereby agrees to reimburse and indemnify and hold AGI harmless from and against all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by AGI as a result of any claim involving or arising in connection with any use other than an Approved Use or a use otherwise approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This removes AGI's obligation to defend and indemnify the Company against trademark infringement claims arising from the use of the licensed Trademarks if the company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. This obligation is a legally required consumer protection, making it non-compliant with the law, and introducing a legal risk in the identified jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 60 days to 10 days unreasonably favors AGI, especially if AGI needs a significant amount of time to find an alternative solution to the current agreement. In some jurisdictions, such a short notice period might be deemed unconscionable, especially if AGI can demonstrate substantial reliance on the agreement over the three-year term. This change introduces legal risk by potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, making it non-compliant with law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'in its reasonable judgment and subject to the advice of its counsel attempt to' makes the company completely and immediately obliged to incorporate any edits AGI proposes. In some jurisdictions, such as California (where this contract is governed), this may be deemed unconscionable, since it completely gives AGI power over press releases with the threat of termination. It is also unreasonable given the time constraints (one day). This change introduces legal risk by potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, making it non-compliant with law.",

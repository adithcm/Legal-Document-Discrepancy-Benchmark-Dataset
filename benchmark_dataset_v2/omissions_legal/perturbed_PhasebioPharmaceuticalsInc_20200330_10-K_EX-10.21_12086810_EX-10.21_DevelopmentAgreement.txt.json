                "changed_text": "Each Party will ensure that IRBs and such other relevant ethics committees have registrations and accreditations.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'as required by Applicable Law' creates ambiguity and allows for a lower standard of compliance with regulatory requirements for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), potentially violating FDA regulations and international ethical guidelines.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to provide 'material Product safety data in all indications (including but not limited to Serious Safety Issues),' the revised text weakens the obligation to disclose critical safety information, potentially violating pharmacovigilance requirements. The FDA and other regulatory bodies mandate the reporting of all adverse events and safety information.",

The removal of '(b) regulatory notifications are filed in all countries for which Sites have been selected; and (c) approvals are obtained in all countries for which Sites have been selected' omits legally required steps, contradicting GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy laws.",

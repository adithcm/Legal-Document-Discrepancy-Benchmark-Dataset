                "changed_text": "NAI retains the right to disapprove or remove any advertisements or advertising materials it deems inappropriate or inconsistent with the purposes of the Originating Sites.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'illegal' and 'without the consent of Co-Host' allows NAI to remove ads based on subjective criteria, including legal compliance, creating risk. This introduces a **legal contradiction** because if NAI were to allow illegal advertising material without the consent of Co-Host to remain it is a violation of California Business and Professions Code regarding false advertising. Further, it fails to protect consumers from potentially harmful or misleading advertising.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will defend' to 'may defend' and removing the infringement stipulations weakens NAI's protection against legal claims related to the advertising materials, infringing materials and operation of the destination. The removal of 'promptly in writing and given sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations' removes a legally required protection. If the Co-Host has other interest they can prioritize, it may not defend NAI, thus violating California's consumer protection laws.",

Also the removal of 'infringes a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right, or (ii) NAI violated any law, statute or ordinance or any governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation' gives them no stipulation to what the allegiation refers to, meaning they might defend in some causes, but not others, thus violating consumer protection laws in California.",

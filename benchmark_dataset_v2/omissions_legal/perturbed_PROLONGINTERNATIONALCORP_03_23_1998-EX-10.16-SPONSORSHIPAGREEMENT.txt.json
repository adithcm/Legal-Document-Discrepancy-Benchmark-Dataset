                "original_text": "Sabco shall provide at its expense and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement and any option period spectator liability insurance in an amount not less than $1 million single limit coverage with respect to any liability relating to the activities of Sabco in the performance of this Agreement.  Sabco shall, within 90 days of the execution of this Agreement, supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 10 days written notice to Prolong.",
                "changed_text": "Sabco shall maintain spectator liability insurance with respect to its activities under this Agreement. Sabco will provide Prolong with a certificate of insurance upon request.  Sabco shall provide notice of cancellation to Prolong.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates a minimum insurance coverage of $1 million and requires Sabco to provide proof of insurance within 90 days. Removing the specific amount and the timeline for providing proof weakens Prolong's protection. Furthermore, removing 'cancelable only upon 10 days written notice' reduces the notice period for cancellation, which is legally contradictory since under North Carolina law, insurance policies require at least 30 days' notice of cancellation.",

The parties hereto hereby submit to jurisdiction and venue in any state or federal court located in North Carolina as well as any other jurisdiction having venue and competent jurisdiction of any law suit arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided, however, if any proceedings are instituted in a jurisdiction other than North Carolina, any party may remove such proceeding to any State or Federal Court in North Carolina.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that North Carolina law governs the agreement and establishes jurisdiction and venue in North Carolina courts. The modified text gives Sabco the right to choose the governing law and jurisdiction. This alteration permits Sabco to select a jurisdiction with laws less favorable to Prolong, potentially undermining Prolong's legal rights and contradicts basic principles of fair contract law, which mandates mutual agreement on governing law and jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The original clause grants Prolong exclusivity, preventing Sabco from sponsoring competing products. Removing the restriction gives Sabco the freedom to sponsor competing brands, directly contradicting Prolong's presumed exclusivity and violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in all contracts under North Carolina law. This introduces significant legal risk by undermining the value of Prolong's sponsorship.",

                "original_text": "Sabco shall provide at its expense and maintain throughout --------- the term of this Agreement and any option period spectator liability insurance in an amount not less than $1 million single limit coverage with respect to any liability relating to the activities of Sabco in the performance of this Agreement. Sabco shall, within 90 days of the execution of this Agreement, supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 10 days written notice to Prolong.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the minimum coverage amount ($1 million) and the requirement for 10 days' written notice before cancellation of the policy introduces legal risk. North Carolina, like many states, has specific requirements for liability insurance coverage for events that draw spectators. By omitting the minimum coverage and cancellation notice, the contract becomes vague and potentially non-compliant with North Carolina insurance regulations, leaving Prolong exposed if Sabco's insurance is inadequate or canceled without notice.",

Sabco shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Prolong, its officers, directors, employees and representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, suits, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorney fees and count costs incurred by any of them arising out of: (i) Any breach of any warrant made by Sabco herein; (ii) Any acts done or words spoken (iii) Any claims by any persons arising from acts or omissions of any nature by Sabco, its employees or agents, including but not limited to, claims arising during the court of competition or practice in the performance of this Agreement. B. Prolong shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sabco, its officers, directors, employees and representatives, from and against any and all losses, claims, suits, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorney fees and court costs incurred by any of them, arising out of: (i) The use of any logo, design or materials furnished to Sabco by Prolong hereunder; (ii) Any breach of any warranty made by Prolong herein; (iii) Any acts done or words spoken by Prolong, its officers, directors, agents, employees and representatives; (iv) Any claims by any persons arising from acts of omissions of any nature by Prolong, its officers, directors, agents, employees or representatives, including, but not limited to, claims arising under any product liability theory with respect to Prolong's products.",

Prolong shall indemnify Sabco from and against any direct damages arising out of Prolong's breach of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the indemnification to \"direct damages\" and removing the explicit mention of covering \"losses, claims, suits, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorney fees and court costs\", the contract significantly reduces the scope of protection for both parties. This omission creates a legal contradiction because standard indemnity clauses, especially in business relationships like this sponsorship, are typically intended to cover a broader range of potential liabilities, including consequential damages and legal defense costs. This change shifts the risk disproportionately and may conflict with common law principles regarding reasonable expectations in commercial contracts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common Law Contract Principles, specifically regarding the interpretation of indemnity clauses and the reasonable expectations of parties in commercial agreements. North Carolina contract law recognizes the importance of clear and comprehensive indemnification, especially in situations involving potential liability for business activities.",

The parties hereto hereby submit to jurisdiction and venue in any state or federal court located in North Carolina as well as any other jurisdiction having venue and competent jurisdiction of any law suit arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided, however, if any proceedings are instituted in a jurisdiction other than North Carolina, any party may remove such proceeding to any State or Federal Court in North Carolina.",

                "explanation": "By changing the governing law from North Carolina to the \"jurisdiction where Prolong's headquarters are located\" (Anaheim, California, as per the contract introduction) and mandating jurisdiction/venue there, the contract creates potential conflicts and omissions. While parties can choose a governing law, imposing California law without explicitly addressing aspects specific to the agreement (e.g., the nature of the sponsorship in North Carolina) can omit protections afforded by North Carolina law regarding racing and related activities. Furthermore, forcing all litigation to California could be seen as unreasonable if the core activities and performance of the contract primarily occur in North Carolina, potentially violating fairness standards.",

                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall purchase an Annual Order Volume (\"AOV\") of Units as mutually agreed upon by both parties. The AOV for each twelve-month period shall be determined based on market conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will purchase an amount to be determined (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a Minimum Annual Order Volume (MAOV) and replacing it with a flexible 'Annual Order Volume' (AOV) to be 'mutually agreed upon,' the contract introduces uncertainty regarding the volume of goods Premier is obligated to purchase. This omission creates a legal contradiction if state laws (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code) mandate specific minimum quantity terms in commercial contracts to ensure enforceability. Omitting the 'contingent upon commercial aseptic production' clause further weakens the obligation, making it dependent on facility approval which may or may not occur. The change from 'required to purchase' to 'will purchase an amount to be determined' introduces further ambiguity that courts may find unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "The Parties hereby agree to replace Section 2(c) in its entirety with the following:\n\nDuring the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall endeavor to purchase a reasonable Annual Order Volume (\"AOV\"). The AOV shall be mutually discussed. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will consider purchasing an amount (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be required to purchase' to 'shall endeavor to purchase' and removing any reference to a 'Minimum Annual Order Volume' (MAOV), the amendment significantly weakens Premier's purchasing obligation. This creates a legal contradiction because contract law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), requires definiteness of quantity terms for enforceability. The phrase 'reasonable Annual Order Volume' lacks specific criteria, and the introduction of 'mutually discussed' without a defined mechanism for resolution can render the agreement unenforceable. Furthermore, changing 'will be required to purchase' to 'will consider purchasing' for the six-month period introduces further ambiguity and optionality that undermines contractual certainty and mutual obligation.",

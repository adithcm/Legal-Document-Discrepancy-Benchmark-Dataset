Accordingly, CELEBRITY will be responsible for payment of all federal, state, and local taxes on compensation paid under this Agreement, including income and social security taxes, unemployment insurance, and any other taxes due relative to Distributor's Personnel and any and all business license fees as may be required. This Agreement neither expressly nor impliedly creates a --- relationship of principal and agent, or employee and employer, between Distributor's Personnel and the COMPANY. Neither CELEBRITY nor CELEBRITY Personnel are authorized to enter into any agreements on behalf of the COMPANY. The COMPANY expressly retains the right to approve, in its sole discretion, each Asset Opportunity or Business Opportunity introduced by CELEBRITY, and to make all final decisions with respect to effecting a transaction on any Business Opportunity.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'and the United States of America' could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid federal laws that may apply to the agreement, particularly regarding interstate commerce or securities regulations if the stock options provision is deemed to be subject to federal securities laws. This creates a legal contradiction as federal law still applies regardless of the contract language.",

                "explanation": "Changing the jurisdiction from California to Delaware can be a significant omission because California has strong consumer protection laws, while Delaware's laws are generally more corporation-friendly. This shift could limit the consumer's ability to pursue certain legal remedies or enjoy the consumer rights they would have had under California law. Delaware courts also are not easily accessible to California residents, further limiting consumer options.",

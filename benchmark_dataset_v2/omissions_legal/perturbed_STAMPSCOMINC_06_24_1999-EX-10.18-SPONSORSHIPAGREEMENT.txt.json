                "original_text": "Client will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of all Transaction Fees due under this Agreement.  Intuit may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Client upon which the calculation of such payments are based during Client's normal business hours.  The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Intuit unless the payments made to Intuit are determined to have been less than ninety- five percent (95%) of the payments actually owed to Intuit, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection. In addition, Client shall immediately remit payment to Intuit for the full amount of any disclosed shortfalls.  The audit rights set forth herein shall continue for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement for any reason. No such audit may occur more than once a year during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Client will maintain records with respect to the calculation of all Transaction Fees due under this Agreement.  Intuit may inspect relevant records of Client upon which the calculation of such payments are based during Client's normal business hours. The fees charged in connection with the inspection will be determined at Intuit's discretion. In addition, Client shall remit payment to Intuit for any disclosed shortfalls.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a Certified Public Accountant and the 30-day notice, the audit becomes less regulated and potentially more intrusive. The removal of the clause about audit rights continuing for one year after termination and the limitation to one audit per year removes protections for the client. These omissions introduce legal risk by potentially violating California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

This Agreement and the performance of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., except that body of law concerning conflicts of laws.  In any action relating to the parties, the parties consent to jurisdiction in a state or federal court in Santa Clara County, California.",

This Agreement and the performance of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction selected by Intuit. In any action relating to the parties, the parties consent to jurisdiction in a court selected by Intuit.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies California law and Santa Clara County jurisdiction. The changed text removes these specifications and gives Intuit the power to choose the governing law and jurisdiction. This introduces legal risk by potentially allowing Intuit to select a jurisdiction with laws unfavorable to the client, thereby breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and potentially violating due process if the chosen jurisdiction has no reasonable connection to the contract.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'Unless required by law' and also removing 'the other' the contract gives intuit total control to release information as they wish. This introduces legal risk by restricting the client's right to disclose information, even if legally required to do so (e.g., for SEC filings if Stamps.com is a public company). This omission contradicts securities laws and regulations requiring truthful and timely disclosure of material information.",

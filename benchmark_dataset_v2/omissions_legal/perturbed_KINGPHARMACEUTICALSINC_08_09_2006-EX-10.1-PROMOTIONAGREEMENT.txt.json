                "original_text": "During the Term and for a period of two (2) years after any expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party shall maintain (i) a commercial general liability insurance policy or policies with minimum limits of $[***] per occurrence and $[***] in the aggregate on an annual basis and (ii) a product liability insurance policy or policies with minimum limits of $[***] per occurrence and $[***] in the aggregate on an annual basis; provided that the minimum product liability policy limits set forth above shall be increased to at least $[***] per occurrence and $[***] in the aggregate on an annual basis no later than December 31, 2006. Furthermore, Depomed will undertake to direct its insurance broker to conduct an analysis to determine the appropriate level of product liability insurance with respect to the Product to be maintained by Depomed, which analysis will be conducted prior to Depomed's next insurance renewal, currently scheduled to occur in October 2006. Such analysis will include, among other considerations, product risk characteristics, product litigation history, comparable company coverage and insurance availability. Depomed will share such analysis with King",

Depomed will undertake to direct its insurance broker to conduct an analysis to determine the appropriate level of product liability insurance with respect to the Product to be maintained by Depomed. Depomed will share such analysis with King",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the minimum coverage limits for both commercial general liability and product liability insurance, and the required duration of the policy after termination. This creates a legal risk because it could violate standard business practices that require specific minimum insurance coverage for businesses operating in the United States. The removal of post-termination coverage also creates a risk.",

King shall not take any other action in respect of any such complaint without the consent of Depomed unless otherwise required by Legal Requirements. If requested by Depomed, King will collaborate with Depomed to resolve any Product Complaints. All Product Complaints shall be directed to the attention of Depomed's Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, at Depomed's address set forth in Section 14.1. Depomed shall provide King with a summary of all Product Complaints received by Depomed within ten business days of its receipt thereof.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the legally required expedited reporting timelines for product complaints, especially those concerning tampering, contamination, or mix-ups.

                "original_text": "Each party agrees that it shall promptly notify the other in writing of any such claim or action and give the indemnifying party full information and assistance in connection therewith. The indemnifying party shall have the sole right to control the defense and the sole right to settle or compromise any such claim or action, except that the prior written consent of the other party shall be required in connection with any settlement or compromise which could (i) place any obligation on or require any action of such other party; (ii) admit or imply any liability or wrongdoing of such other party; or (iii) adversely affect the goodwill or public image of such other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party may participate therein through counsel of its choice, but the cost of such counsel shall be borne solely by the indemnified party. The provisions of this Section 11.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for three years (except as to claims as to which a party has notified the other in writing prior to the third anniversary of the termination date of this Agreement, in which event, the indemnifying party's obligations under this Section 11.1 shall survive with respect to any such claim until its resolution).",

                "explanation": "By removing 'promptly' and 'in writing' requirements from the notification clause and the conditions requiring consent for settlement, the amendment weakens the indemnification process. In many U.S. jurisdictions, a prompt and written notice is a prerequisite for indemnification claims to be valid. The modification eliminates key protections for the indemnified party.",

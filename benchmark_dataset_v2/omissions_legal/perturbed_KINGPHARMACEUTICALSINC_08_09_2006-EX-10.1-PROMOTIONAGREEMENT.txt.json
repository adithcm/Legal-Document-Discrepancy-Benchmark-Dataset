Furthermore, Depomed will undertake to direct its insurance broker to conduct an analysis to determine the appropriate level of product liability insurance with respect to the Product to be maintained by Depomed, which analysis will be conducted prior to Depomed's next insurance renewal, currently scheduled to occur in October 2006. Such analysis will include, among other considerations, product risk characteristics, product litigation history, comparable company coverage and insurance availability. Depomed will share such analysis with King",

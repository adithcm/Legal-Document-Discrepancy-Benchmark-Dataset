                "original_text": "Eurofarma shall assume full responsibility for all post MA approval Pharmacovigilance activities in the Territory Each Party has the right to receive in good faith all the safety documents referring to the product filed by the other Party to regulatory authorities including PSURs (Periodic Safety Update Report), PBRER (Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report), RMP (Risk Management plans), but not limited to only these. Further, each Party agrees to report to the other Party any serious and unexpected adverse reaction with the use of mazindol CR in the Field within two business days of the initial receipt of a report or sooner if required for either Party to comply with regulatory requirements; and the Parties agree that the Licensee shall immediately report and notify in writing to NLS any adverse or suspected safety adverse events whether related or not to the Licensed Product (the \"SAE's\" and the \"SUSAR's\"). Parties shall then immediately set a Pharmacovigilance meeting or conference call to review such case and decide on course of action, in full compliance with their obligations under relevant laws and guidelines.",
                "changed_text": "Eurofarma shall assume responsibility for Pharmacovigilance activities in the Territory as deemed necessary by its internal policies. Each Party will share safety documents at their discretion. Each Party agrees to report adverse reactions as they see fit, and the Licensee will notify NLS of significant safety events as determined by Licenseeâ€™s internal assessment. Parties will schedule meetings as needed.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation to strictly adhere to regulatory requirements for pharmacovigilance. It weakens the requirements of good faith for safety document exchange, and eliminates the two-business-day reporting requirement for serious adverse reactions, as required for example by Brazil's ANVISA and other Latin American regulatory bodies, and it removes the mandate to have set pharmacovigilance meetings to review cases to decide on course of action, contradicting established regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by country in Latin America (e.g., ANVISA in Brazil, COFEPRIS in Mexico) but generally violates pharmacovigilance reporting requirements.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any actual or suspected third party infringement of the Intellectual Property or the Developed Intellectual Property in the Territory, NLS may take at its sole discretion any steps (including legal action) to prosecute the infringement. Licensee shall on request support NLS in all activities which involve the protection of the Intellectual Property and the Developed Intellectual Property and to prosecute the infringement. From the date of notice of a potential infringement, NLS shall have 5 (five) days to communicate to Eurofarma whether it will take actions against such potential infringements. If NLS resolves not to take any such action, the Licensee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take all activities and steps to protect the Intellectual Property and the Developed Intellectual Property in the Territory, provided however, that the Licensee shall not accept pay, settle or compromise any such claim or proceedings without the prior written consent of NLS.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a third-party infringement of Intellectual Property, NLS may consider taking steps to prosecute. Licensee may offer support to NLS. If NLS does not take action, Licensee may protect the Intellectual Property, provided that the Licensee shall not settle any claim or proceedings without the prior written consent of NLS.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation of NLS to act against infringement, replacing 'shall take at its sole discretion any steps (including legal action) to prosecute the infringement' with 'may consider taking steps to prosecute'. It removes the defined timeframe of 5 days for NLS to decide on action, potentially delaying or preventing action against infringements. The deletion of 'actual or suspected' means that infringements might be missed entirely. The deletion of Developed Intellectual property also is a big loss. This weakens the IP protection clauses, which can contradict laws that mandate the active protection of intellectual property rights in Latin American countries.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by country in Latin America but generally weakens IP protection, potentially violating obligations under treaties like the TRIPS Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The omissions remove crucial warranties related to Licensor's authority, capacity and accurate and true representation in all respects, its intellectual property rights (e.g., no unlawful copying, non-infringement of third-party IP), and regulatory compliance (removing language about potential non-compliance or lack of safety). These weaken protections for Licensee, removing guarantees that are often legally expected in licensing agreements, and reduces Licensee ability to claim on those points. It restricts the level of security regarding regulatory compliance. The warranty now only addresses an 'investigation' vs. all possibilities, and the original text included a reference to safety.",

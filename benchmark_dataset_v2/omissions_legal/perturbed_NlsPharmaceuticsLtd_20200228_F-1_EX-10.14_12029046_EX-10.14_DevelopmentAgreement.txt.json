                "explanation": "The removal of explicit mentions of PSURs, PBRER, and RMP reports weakens the commitment to comprehensive pharmacovigilance. Removing the requirement of reporting within two business days and the mandatory setting of a Pharmacovigilance meeting, and the clause 'in full compliance with their obligations under relevant laws and guidelines' reduces the diligence required. Changing 'will negotiate and enter' to 'may enter' makes the Safety Data Exchange Agreement optional, significantly reducing the commitment to safety data exchange, all of which introduce a **legal contradiction** with the obligations of pharmacovigilance in Brazil. According to ANVISA regulations, certain pharmacovigilance obligations such as expedited reporting of adverse events are legally mandated. This modification weakens the licensee's responsibility.",

Indemnities by the Licensee Without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor from and against all Losses suffered, incurred, sustained by or imposed upon Licensor resulting from or arising out of: a) any breach of the representations and warranties made by the Licensee; b) any non-performance or breach of any of the Licensee's obligations under this Agreement. 17.3. Third party claims If any claim is brought against a Party entitled to the benefit of an indemnity set out in this Agreement (the \"Indemnified Party\") by any third party which is likely to result in a claim against the other Party who has given an indemnity under this Agreement (the \"Indemnifying Party\"), the Indemnified Party shall a) give notice of such third party claim to the Indemnifying Party as soon as reasonably practicable in reasonable detail, including a reasonable explanation of why the Indemnified Party assumes that it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement; b) keep the Indemnifying Party promptly and fully informed and documented as to the progress of any such claim; c) subject to the Indemnified Party being entitled to employ its own legal advisors take all reasonable steps as to minimise or resolve such liability or dispute and, upon request by the Indemnifying Party, allow the Indemnifying Party to lead or direct the proceedings; d) cooperate with all reasonable requests of the Indemnifying Party in relation to such claim; and e) not accept, pay, settle or compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).",

                "explanation": "By removing 'defend and hold harmless' significantly weakens the obligation to protect the other party from claims. Removing the detailed description of 'Losses' such as 'court costs, amounts paid in settlement and any legal, accounting and other expert fees and expenses reasonably incurred' introduces ambiguity and limits the scope of indemnification. Removing clause b) in 17.1 eliminates indemnification for non-performance. Deleting detailed clauses regarding the Indemnified Party's obligations to provide 'reasonable detail' in notices, 'fully informed and documented' progress updates, and the ability to employ their own legal advisors weakens the protection offered. Changing 'take all reasonable steps as to minimize or resolve such liability or dispute and, upon request by the Indemnifying Party, allow the Indemnifying Party to lead or direct the proceedings' to only 'cooperate with reasonable requests of the Indemnifying Party in relation to such claim' reduces the active responsibility. This violates Brazilian Civil Code which outlines a broad interpretation for damages and breaches, which would contradict these changes. The limited liability for the Licensor may not be enforceable under Brazilian law, especially concerning consumer protection.",

Confidentiality Obligations a) Confidential Information shall mean any information that (i) is not publicly known (ii) has been imparted in circumstances in which the recipient ought reasonably to have known that the information had been imparted in confidence. This includes especially but not exclusively the information described in the clauses 18.1 b), c) and d). b) Each Party undertakes to maintain confidentiality as regards the execution and terms of this Agreement, and to abstain from disclosing the existence of this Agreement, its contents and all information provided to it by the other Party in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement without prior written approval of the other Party. c) The Licensee shall maintain confidentiality with regard to the Dossier and Know-how and any operations, processes, product information, product formulations, information regarding applications and submissions, know-how, designs, trade secrets, product plans, product development efforts, other commercial and product data, software, prototypes, samples and/or data sets related thereto, and any information or analysis derived from Confidential Information. For the avoidance of any doubt, the confidentiality of the Dossier and Know-how shall only apply to information that at the time of assessment is actually considered to be confidential, and not, under any circumstances, the information that lawfully is or has become available to the public. d) The Licensee shall protect any Know-how and any data as Confidential Information and shall not use the Know-how and data for any purpose except as expressly licensed hereby and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") undertakes: (i.) to maintain as secret and confidential all Confidential Information obtained directly or indirectly from the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") in the course of this Agreement and to respect the Disclosing Party's rights therein; (ii.) to use such Confidential Information only for the purposes of this Agreement; and (iii.) to disclose such Confidential Information only to those of its employees, contractors, and sub-licensees pursuant to this Agreement (if any) to whom and to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for the purposes of this Agreement. 18.2. Exceptions to Obligations The provisions of clause 18.1 shall not apply to Confidential Information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by reasonable, written evidence; (i.) is or has become generally available to the public other than as a direct or indirect result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its representatives; or (ii.) was, prior to its receipt by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party, in the possession of the Receiving Party and at its free disposal; or (iii.) is subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party without any obligations of confidence by a Third Party who has not derived it directly or indirectly from the Disclosing Party; or (iv.) was or is developed by or on behalf of the Receiving Party independently of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (v.) the Receiving Party is required to disclose to the courts of any competent jurisdiction, or to any government regulatory agency, or financial authority, provided that the Receiving Party shall (i) inform the Disclosing Party as soon as is reasonably practicable, and (ii) at the Disclosing Party's request seek to persuade the court, agency, or authority to have the information treated in a confidential manner, where this is possible under the court, agency, or authority's procedures. 18.3.

                "explanation": "By significantly reducing the definition of 'Confidential Information,' the agreement weakens the protection afforded to sensitive data. The removal of the clause '(ii) has been imparted in circumstances in which the recipient ought reasonably to have known that the information had been imparted in confidence' removes an objective assessment standard for confidential information, and removes the clauses about Licensee specific details, this could lead to confidential info to be used unfairly. Removing 'and to respect the Disclosing Party's rights therein' from 18.1(i) lessens the receiving party's obligation. By deleting 'contractors, and sub-licensees pursuant to this Agreement (if any)' from the permitted disclosures in 18.1(iii), the scope of allowable disclosure is greatly reduced and unpractical for the modern reality of contracts. Reducing the survival period of confidentiality obligations from ten (10) to two (2) years severely limits the protection of confidential data, violating Brazilian Trade Secret Law (Law No. 9.279/96) which requires longer protection periods, potentially leading to unfair competition or misuse of trade secrets after the agreement ends. By removing the 'reasonable written evidence' clause it becomes harder to prove whether the exceptions apply or not. By removing clauses (ii-v) from the exceptions, it limits the definition of what isn't confidential, thus weakening the Receiving Party even further.",

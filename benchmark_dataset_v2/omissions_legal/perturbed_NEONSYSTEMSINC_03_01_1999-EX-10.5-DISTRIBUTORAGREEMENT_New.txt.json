If Licensee or any Redistributor or Customer discovers any errors or discrepancies in the Licensed Products from the Documentation during the twelve (12) month warranty period, Licensee shall notify Licensor promptly in writing of such error or discrepancy in sufficient detail to enable Licensor to recreate the error or discrepancy.  If the error or discrepancy is found by Licensee prior to the expiration of the ten (10) day evaluation period set forth in Section 4.2, such evaluation period shall be extended ten (10) days from the date of receipt by Licensee of the corrected Licensed Product from Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor makes no warranties regarding the performance of any Licensed Product delivered to a Customer. Licensee is solely responsible for addressing customer issues related to performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 12-month warranty for product performance. This modification removes that warranty entirely, shifting the responsibility to the Licensee. This creates a legal risk because Texas law, particularly the implied warranty of merchantability under the UCC, may require a minimum level of performance assurance. Removing this may violate consumer protection laws.",

If such error or discrepancy is not resolved within thirty (30) days after Licensee's written notice to Licensor, then Licensee as its sole remedy may (a) extend the correction period to a date which is agreeable to Licensor and Licensee or (b) return all copies of the Licensed Products to Licensor with a certification by an authorized representative of Licensee that all copies have been returned to Licensor or have been destroyed and that Licensee has not retained any copies thereof and Licensor shall refund to Licensee the amount paid by Licensee to Licensor for such Licensed Products.  Licensee shall pay for all services rendered by Licensor in connection with the Licensed Products or Documentation that are not covered or at that time are no longer covered by the warranty described in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "If any issue arises with a Licensed Product, Licensor may, at its sole discretion, provide assistance. Licensee shall be responsible for all costs associated with such assistance.",
                "explanation": "This significantly weakens the Licensor's obligation to correct errors. The original provides a specific process for addressing errors. The modified version makes assistance optional and puts all costs on the Licensee. This creates a potential violation of consumer protection laws, as it undermines the warranty implied by law and shifts the burden of fixing defects onto the consumer.",

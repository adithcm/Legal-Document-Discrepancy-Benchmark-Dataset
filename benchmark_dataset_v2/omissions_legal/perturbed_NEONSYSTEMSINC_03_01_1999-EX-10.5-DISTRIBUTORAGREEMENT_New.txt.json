                "original_text": "For twelve (12) months after delivery of any Licensed Product to a Customer, whether Customer receives such Licensed Product from Licensee or a Redistributor, Licensor warrants that each Licensed Product will perform as described in the applicable Documentation. If Licensee or any Redistributor or Customer discovers any errors or discrepancies in the Licensed Products from the Documentation during the twelve (12) month warranty period, Licensee shall notify Licensor promptly in writing of such error or discrepancy in sufficient detail to enable Licensor to recreate the error or discrepancy. If the error or discrepancy is found by Licensee prior to the expiration of the ten (10) day evaluation period set forth in Section 4.2, such evaluation period shall be extended ten (10) days from the date of receipt by Licensee of the corrected Licensed Product from Licensor.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor warrants that each Licensed Product will perform to a reasonable extent. If Licensee or any Redistributor or Customer discovers any errors or discrepancies in the Licensed Products from the Documentation, Licensee may notify Licensor. If the error or discrepancy is found by Licensee prior to the expiration of the ten (10) day evaluation period set forth in Section 4.2, the evaluation period may be extended.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 12-month warranty period and specifics the procedure for notifying licensor of defects, while the new text doesn't offer any guarantees of the Licensed Product, removes the warranty period, and uses the ambiguous term 'reasonable extent'. Omitting the warranty period and the specific notification timeline violates consumer protection laws, which mandate a reasonable warranty period and a clear process for resolving issues.",

If such error or discrepancy is not resolved within thirty (30) days after Licensee's written notice to Licensor, then Licensee as its sole remedy may (a) extend the correction period to a date which is agreeable to Licensor and Licensee or (b) return all copies of the Licensed Products to Licensor with a certification by an authorized representative of Licensee that all copies have been returned to Licensor or have been destroyed and that Licensee has not retained any copies thereof and Licensor shall refund to Licensee the amount paid by Licensee to Licensor for such Licensed Products. Licensee shall pay for all services rendered by Licensor in connection with the Licensed Products or Documentation that are not covered or at that time are no longer covered by the warranty described in this Agreement.",

If such error or discrepancy is not resolved, then remedies will be determined at the discretion of the Licensor. Licensee shall pay for all services rendered by Licensor in connection with the Licensed Products or Documentation.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides remedies such as the Licensor is obligated to correct errors for the Licensor failing to provide the agreed upon correction, refunding the full price. The modified text removes a material obligation of the Licensor and removes Licensee's right to demand a correction, violating consumer protection laws, which mandate a reasonable warranty period and a clear process for resolving issues. Additionally, this alteration shifts power entirely to the Licensor regarding remedies.",

However, the modified text introduces a complete disclaimer of all warranties.

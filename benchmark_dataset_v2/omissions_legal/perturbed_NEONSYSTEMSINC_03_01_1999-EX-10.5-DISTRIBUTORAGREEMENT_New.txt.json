                "original_text": "For twelve (12) months after delivery of any Licensed Product to a Customer, whether Customer receives such Licensed Product from Licensee or a Redistributor, Licensor warrants that each Licensed Product will perform as described in the applicable Documentation. If Licensee or any Redistributor or Customer discovers any errors or discrepancies in the Licensed Products from the Documentation during the twelve (12) month warranty period, Licensee shall notify Licensor promptly in writing of such error or discrepancy in sufficient detail to enable Licensor to recreate the error or discrepancy.",
                "changed_text": "Licensor may, at its discretion, provide a warranty for any Licensed Product delivered to a Customer. The terms and duration of such warranty, if any, shall be determined solely by Licensor.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the mandatory 12-month warranty period and replaces it with a discretionary warranty. Many jurisdictions, including Texas (the governing law of this agreement), have implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. By making the warranty discretionary, the contract attempts to circumvent these implied warranties, potentially violating consumer protection laws. Additionally, the vagueness of \"terms and duration...determined solely by Licensor\" provides no assurance of minimum standards, creating further legal risk.",

                "changed_text": "If any error in any Licensed Product or discrepancy in any Licensed Product from the Documentation that results in any performance issue is discovered, the Licensor may attempt to provide Licensee with a potential solution.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the explicit obligation of the Licensor to provide a 'correction or method of resolving such error or discrepancy' with a discretionary offer to 'attempt to provide Licensee with a potential solution.' This weakens the consumer's right to a functional product or remedy for defects and increases legal risk by contravening implied warranty obligations under Texas law. By removing the responsibility to correct, it contradicts consumer protection laws that mandate remedies for defective products. It also removes the exclusion regarding the licensee/redistributor/customer incorrectly using the product, which places all risk on the licensor.",

                "explanation": "This aggressively disclaims all warranties except those explicitly stated (which are now weakened or discretionary due to the previous edits). While disclaimers are possible, they must be conspicuous and not unconscionable. A blanket disclaimer like this is likely to be challenged under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which provide implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This omission creates substantial legal risk, especially if the product fails to perform as reasonably expected.",

                "changed_text": "9.9 Applicable Law \nThis IP Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties will be governed by and construed in accordance with the rules and substantive laws as determined solely by Sony Electronics Inc., without regard to conflicts of law provisions.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit reference to California law, giving SONY unilateral power to determine the applicable law. This introduces a legal risk because it could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent consumer protection laws or other regulations mandated by California.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. The modified text gives SONY sole discretion in determining if and when it can recover these fees, effectively removing the reciprocal right of GSI Technology to claim attorneys' fees if they prevail. This puts GSI at a legal disadvantage, especially if Sony chooses not to award fees even when GSI is successful in court. It violates the legal tenet of even playing field.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, on condition that it provides the other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment.

Any attempted transfer in contravention of this Section 9.3 shall be null and void.",
                "explanation": "This change restricts GSI Technology's ability to assign the agreement while leaving Sony's rights unrestricted. Many jurisdictions have laws ensuring reasonable freedom to assign contracts, especially in cases like mergers or acquisitions. This asymmetry creates a legal risk as it may be deemed unconscionable or an unfair business practice.",

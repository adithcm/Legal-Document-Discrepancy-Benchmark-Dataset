                "explanation": "Removing the reference to Nevada law and simply stating that the agreement is governed by its terms significantly weakens consumer protection. Nevada law, like the law of many states in the US, includes implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. By removing the explicit reference to Nevada law, the agreement attempts to circumvent these protections, creating a potential contradiction with Nevada state law if the terms of the agreement are deemed to be unfair or exploitative. If, for example, the contract operates in a way that unfairly benefits one party over the other, Nevada law would normally imply a duty of good faith to prevent such an outcome. Omitting the state law opens a legal loophole for HPIL ET to cause damage to GINARES without the legal protection.",

Each of GINARES  and HPIL ET has at all times complied with all legal requirements relating to export control and trade sanctions or embargoes. Either GINARES or HPIL ET have violated the antiboycott prohibitions contained in 50 U.S.C.

                "explanation": "By omitting the compliance clauses regarding export control, trade sanctions, embargoes and antiboycott laws, the agreement creates a legal risk, particularly for HPIL ET, a US corporation. US law mandates strict adherence to these regulations, and a failure to comply can result in significant penalties and legal repercussions. Deleting these clauses suggests a potential lack of due diligence or awareness of these obligations, which contradicts the implicit expectation of legal compliance. This omission could expose HPIL ET to legal liability if GINARES were to violate these laws without HPIL ET taking appropriate preventative measures. The clause: 'Each of GINARES and HPIL ET has at all times complied with all legal requirements relating to export control and trade sanctions or embargoes' and 'Either GINARES or HPIL ET have violated the antiboycott prohibitions contained in 50 U.S.C. Sections 2401 et seq. or taken any action that can be penalized under Section 999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.' was taken out.",

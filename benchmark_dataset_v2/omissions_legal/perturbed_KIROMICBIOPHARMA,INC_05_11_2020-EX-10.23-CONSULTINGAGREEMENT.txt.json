                "original_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or breach thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration controlled by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The number of arbitrator(s) shall be one. The seat of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas. Texas law shall also apply to the extent necessary to fill any gaps created by the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgement of the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is held illegal or unenforceable in a arbitration proceeding, such provision shall be severed and shall be inoperative, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain operative and binding on the Parties. The arbitrator(s) shall have sole kompetenz-kompetenz regarding this Arbitration Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'controlled by the rules of the American Arbitration Association' and 'Texas law shall also apply to the extent necessary to fill any gaps created by the rules of the American Arbitration Association' and 'The arbitrator(s) shall have sole kompetenz-kompetenz regarding this Arbitration Agreement.', the contract eliminates specific procedural protections and governing law typically afforded to parties in arbitration under Texas law and AAA rules. This omission could disadvantage the consultant by creating ambiguity about the arbitration process and applicable law, thus limiting their ability to effectively challenge the arbitration's fairness or outcome.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Arbitration Act and potentially the Federal Arbitration Act, which are intended to ensure fair and transparent arbitration proceedings. Also, AAA rules which offer specific guidelines for arbitration proceedings.",

                "changed_text": "Consultant may be given written notice of any adjustments to compensation prior to adjustments becoming effective.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be given' to 'may be given', the company is no longer legally obligated to provide the consultant with written notice before adjusting their compensation. This violates standard labor practices and potentially contract law principles requiring fair notice of changes to employment terms, which could be interpreted as a breach of good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding good faith and fair dealing, and possibly specific Texas labor laws regarding notification of changes to compensation.",

Please note that because of employer regulations adopted in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, within three (3) business days of starting your new position you will need to present documentation demonstrating that you have authorization to work in the United States. If you have questions about this requirement, which applies to U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens alike, please let us know.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause regarding the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the company removes the explicit requirement for the consultant to provide documentation demonstrating authorization to work in the United States within three business days. Although the background check contingency may implicitly cover this, the removal of the explicit requirement introduces ambiguity and potential non-compliance with federal law, particularly regarding employer verification responsibilities under IRCA.",

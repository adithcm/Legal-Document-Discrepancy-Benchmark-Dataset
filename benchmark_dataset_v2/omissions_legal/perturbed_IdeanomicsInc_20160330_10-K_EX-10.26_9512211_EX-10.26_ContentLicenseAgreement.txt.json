                "original_text": "Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold the other party and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, assigns, licensees and distributors harmless from and against any and all judgments, settlements, damages, penalties, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any third party claims relating to the Indemnifying Party's breach or alleged breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations hereunder. The party seeking indemnification (the \"Indemnified Party\") will give prompt notice to the indemnifying party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement; provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual material prejudice by such failure). The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate (at the Indemnifying Party's expense) in the defense of any claim for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Section 13. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party has been authorized by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel in writing that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of the action (in which case the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to direct the defense of the action on behalf of the Indemnified Party); or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of the action within a reasonable time following receipt of the notice given pursuant to this Section 13, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement of an action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor will the Indemnifying Party settle any such action without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a release from all liability with respect to the claim.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase \"provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual material prejudice by such failure)\", the clause becomes more onerous on the Indemnified Party, potentially violating laws related to fair contract terms and good faith. By removing \"(at the Indemnifying Party's expense)\", the financial burden of defense is shifted to the Indemnified Party. And by omitting clauses related to the Indemnifying Party's control over the defense and settlement terms, we are removing some required steps to maintain a fair balance in rights.",

                "explanation": "Omitting the clause \"who, prior to obtaining such access, are legally bound to protect the disclosing party's Confidential Information at least to the same extent as set forth herein;\" removes a key protection for confidential information, potentially violating data protection laws.

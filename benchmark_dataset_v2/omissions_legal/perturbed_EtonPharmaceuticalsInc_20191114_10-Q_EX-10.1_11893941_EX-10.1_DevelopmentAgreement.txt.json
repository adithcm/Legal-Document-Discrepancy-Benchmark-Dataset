                "original_text": "At all times from the first commercial sale of any Product(s) or after the Effective Date through the date which is five (5) years after the final sale of such Product(s), the Parties will maintain general liability insurance in amounts that are reasonable and customary in the pharmaceutical industry, provided in no event shall the general liability insurance amounts be less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence and ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate limit of liability per year. The Parties shall provide written proof of such insurance to each other upon request.",
                "changed_text": "From the Effective Date through the date which is five (5) years after the final sale of such Product(s), the Parties may maintain general liability insurance. Proof of insurance will not be required.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated that both parties maintain general liability insurance with specific minimum coverage amounts, which is a standard practice in pharmaceutical agreements to protect against potential liabilities. By removing the requirement to maintain insurance and eliminating the minimum coverage amounts, the modified clause creates a significant legal risk. This omission violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it leaves each party vulnerable to potentially catastrophic liabilities without adequate insurance coverage. This could be seen as a breach of contract if one party suffers significant damages due to the other's lack of insurance.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the calculations to be in line with U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and that all books and records are maintained in accordance with standard cost accounting policies and practices, in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Term plus an additional three (3) years thereafter. This is standard to ensure proper auditing and transparency in financial reporting, especially given that milestone payments and royalties are based on Net Sales. The modified clause weakens this requirement significantly by eliminating the U.S. GAAP compliance and stating that some books and records need to be maintained. This weakens transparency and increases the risk of financial misreporting.",

All such information shall be retained on a confidential basis by the accounting firm, and such accounting firm's use of such information shall be limited to the aforementioned verification.

                "explanation": "The original clause details a structured audit process with specific requirements: a certified independent accounting firm, reasonable access, confidentiality agreements, limitations to maintain legal privilege, and restrictions on contingency-based payments. The modified clause eliminates all these protections, introducing a significant risk of biased or unreliable audits. Removing the independence and confidentiality requirements increases the potential for conflicts of interest and misuse of sensitive information. Allowing contingency-based payments incentivize the accounting firm to produce results favorable to the auditing party, compromising the objectivity and reliability of the audit. All of these violations breach the securities act.",

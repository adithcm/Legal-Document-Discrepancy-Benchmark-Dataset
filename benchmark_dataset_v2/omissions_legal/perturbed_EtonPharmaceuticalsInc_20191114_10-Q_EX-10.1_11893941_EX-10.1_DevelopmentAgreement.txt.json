The Parties shall provide written proof of such insurance to each other upon request.",
                "changed_text": "At all times from the first commercial sale of any Product(s) or after the Effective Date through the date which is five (5) years after the final sale of such Product(s), the Parties will maintain general liability insurance in amounts they deem appropriate. Proof of insurance is not required.",
                "explanation": "By removing the minimum insurance coverage amounts and eliminating the requirement for proof of insurance, the contract contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law, especially considering the inherent risks associated with pharmaceutical products. This omission creates legal risk by leaving the company exposed to potentially inadequate coverage in the event of a product liability claim. This change removes the minimum amount of liability insurance that is supposed to be covered for both companies.",

                "explanation": "By weakening the commitment to maintaining all necessary licenses and approvals to a mere 'attempt,' this modification introduces a significant legal risk. Pharmaceutical companies are legally required to maintain strict compliance with FDA regulations and other governmental standards. Failure to do so can result in severe penalties, including product recalls, fines, and legal action.

The Parties hereby agree to remove Schedule C-1 in its entirety and replace it with the following:\n\nSchedule C-1. The following is attached to an incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule C-1:\n\nSchedule C-1([***])\n\n[***]\n\n2. Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Heritage and Premier entered into the Agreement;\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to amend the Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants, representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and set forth herein, the Parties hereby agree that the following changes shall be made to the Agreement:\n\n1.

Except as otherwise specified above in this Amendment, all other terms, conditions and covenants of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Heritage explicitly waives all implied warranties, including but not limited to the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. All disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration, and the consumer hereby waives their right to a jury trial.",
                "explanation": "The added clause waiving implied warranties and jury trial rights removes legally protected consumer rights. Under the Uniform Commercial Code and state consumer protection laws, implied warranties provide baseline product quality guarantees. Waiving jury trial rights also removes a crucial consumer protection in dispute resolution. The line \"All disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration, and the consumer hereby waives their right to a jury trial.\", is particularly egregious as it forces consumers into arbitration without the possibility of a jury trial.",

Premier's liability for product defects is limited to the replacement cost of the defective goods. Consequential damages are explicitly excluded.",
                "explanation": "Limiting liability for product defects to replacement cost and excluding consequential damages severely restricts the consumer's ability to recover losses from faulty products.

                "explanation": "By stating there are no cancellation rights after order placement, this violates cooling-off periods mandated by some state laws or regulations. These laws allow consumers to cancel certain contracts within a specific timeframe. By explicitly stating the absence of this right, the agreement contradicts these protections.",

                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Company will comply, and will ensure that the Mirror Company Site, the Spoken-Word Audio Products and all other activities undertaken through or in connection with the Mirror Company Site and this Agreement (including, without limitation, the participation of ACSI and its Affiliates as contemplated by this Agreement) comply with all applicable Laws.",
                "changed_text": "Company will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Mirror Company Site, the Spoken-Word Audio Products and all other activities undertaken through or in connection with the Mirror Company Site and this Agreement (including, without limitation, the participation of ACSI and its Affiliates as contemplated by this Agreement) comply with Laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will comply' to 'will make reasonable efforts to ensure compliance' weakens the obligation and introduces ambiguity. This could be interpreted as allowing for non-compliance if 'reasonable efforts' are made, even if those efforts are insufficient to achieve actual compliance. This contradicts the implicit requirement in Washington state law (where the agreement is governed) that businesses must fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations.",

                "explanation": "By inserting the language 'use commercially reasonable efforts', the legal obligation on the company becomes weaker than before. It introduces a loophole that they can claim that they made reasonable efforts. This modification is in contradiction with the legal and regulatory landscape for the insurance policies in Washington State that require insurance and waiver of subrogation against all the parties.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'misappropriation' and the 'at a minimum, will take precautions at least as great as those taken to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event with less than reasonable care' weakens the protection of Confidential Information. By removing these clauses, the Receiving Party does not need to provide the level of safety that they do for their own information. This introduces a contradiction with trade secret laws that requires protection of confidential information.",

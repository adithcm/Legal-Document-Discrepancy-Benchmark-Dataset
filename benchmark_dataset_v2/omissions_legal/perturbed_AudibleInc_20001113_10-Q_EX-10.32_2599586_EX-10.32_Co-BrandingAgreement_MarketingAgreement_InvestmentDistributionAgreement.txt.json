Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company will ensure that such policies contain a waiver of subrogation against ACSI, name ACSI and its assignees as additional insureds.  Company will not modify or terminate any coverage without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to ACSI. Upon request from ACSI, Company will furnish to ACSI certificates of insurance and such other documentation relating to such policies as ACSI may reasonably request.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'such policy or policies of insurance as is commercially reasonable for the transactions and business contemplated by this Agreement' weakens the required coverage. The deletion of 'Company will not modify or terminate any coverage without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to ACSI' allows the company to change the insurance without informing ACSI. The removal of 'and such other documentation relating to such policies as ACSI may reasonably request' restricts ACSI's ability to verify compliance. These changes introduce a legal contradiction with standard business practice and insurance regulations that mandate reasonable coverage and transparency.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'all other activities undertaken through or in connection with the Mirror Company Site and this Agreement (including, without limitation, the participation of ACSI and its Affiliates as contemplated by this Agreement),' the obligation to ensure compliance with all applicable laws is narrowed. This reduces the scope of legal responsibility, creating a potential loophole for activities that might fall outside the direct operation of the Mirror Company Site or the Spoken-Word Audio Products but are still connected to the agreement.

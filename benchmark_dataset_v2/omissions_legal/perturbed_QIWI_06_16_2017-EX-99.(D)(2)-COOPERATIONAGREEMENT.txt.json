                "changed_text": "9.1 This Agreement and any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Cyprus.",
                "explanation": "By changing the governing law from England and Wales to the Republic of Cyprus and removing 'or its subject matter, existence, negotiation, validity, termination, breach or enforceability (including non-contractual disputes or claims)', the agreement now lacks clarity on the dispute resolution process, creating a legal loophole. The omitted clauses normally provides comprehensive coverage for disputes and claims related to the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "9.2 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (\"Dispute\") may be subject to mediation.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the detailed arbitration clause with a vague reference to mediation, the contract removes a clear mechanism for dispute resolution. Arbitration clauses provide a structured and binding process, which is a common and expected practice. Removing this and only suggesting mediation creates ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the agreement, since mediation is not binding.",

                "changed_text": "Clause intentionally removed.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause that outlines the procedures for serving legal documents, the contract creates a significant legal risk. Without a clear method for service of process, it becomes difficult to initiate legal proceedings or enforce any judgments. This omission directly impacts the enforceability of the agreement and the ability to resolve disputes effectively, undermining the principles of natural justice and due process. This creates ambiguity in determining where the proper jurisdiction for legal proceedings would be.",

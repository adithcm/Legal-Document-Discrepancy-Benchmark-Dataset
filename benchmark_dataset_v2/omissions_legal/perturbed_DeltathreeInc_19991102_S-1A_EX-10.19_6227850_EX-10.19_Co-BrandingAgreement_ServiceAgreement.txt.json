This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, each party hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, sitting in New York County, and the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party. In any such suit, action or proceeding, each party waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons, complaint or other process and agrees that the service thereof may be made by certified or registered mail, addressed to such party at its address set forth in Section 9.03  [Notices]. Each party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding.",

The original clause prevents parties from challenging the venue or claiming inconvenient forum, streamlining dispute resolution. Removing this waiver opens the door for legal challenges regarding jurisdiction and venue, potentially prolonging legal battles and increasing costs. This omission contradicts the principle of efficient dispute resolution, which can be seen as going against consumer rights by increasing the difficulty of resolving potential issues.",

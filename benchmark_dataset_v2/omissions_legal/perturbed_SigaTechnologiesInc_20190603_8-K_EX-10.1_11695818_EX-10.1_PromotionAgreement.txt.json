                "original_text": "MMT and SIGA shall each, at their sole cost and expense, procure and maintain (a) commercial general liability insurance in amounts not less than $[***] per incident and $[***] annual aggregate, and (c) product liability insurance in amounts not less than $[***] annual aggregate, and each naming the other Party as additional insured. MMT and SIGA shall maintain such insurance throughout the Term, and shall from time to time provide copies of certificates of such insurance the other Party upon request.",

                "explanation": "The removal of specific insurance coverage amounts weakens the obligation, contradicting standard business practices and potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. Removing the requirement to provide certificates of insurance eliminates a crucial compliance measure. Insurance requirements are essential, and laws usually mandate that a certain insurance coverage should be in place. By omitting these requirements, this creates legal risk.",

Omitting these could violate consumer protection laws that imply these warranties, creating legal risk for misleading business practices regarding the products being provided under contract.

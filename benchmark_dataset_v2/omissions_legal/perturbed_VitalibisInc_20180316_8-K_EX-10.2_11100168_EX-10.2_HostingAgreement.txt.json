VOTOCAST will only access and disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and government orders or requests, to provide the Services, to operate or maintain its systems or to protect itself or Licensee Users. In all such instances. VOTOCAST shall provide prior written notice to Licensee of not less than three (3) business days prior to accessing or disclosing such information so that Licensee may have an opportunity to dispute or restrict such disclosure. Licensee acknowledges, however, that Licensee and Licensee Users' content will not pass through nor be stored in a segregated or separate physical location from which VOTOCAST'S other users content will be transmitted or stored.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'as necessary to comply with applicable laws and government orders or requests,' the contract fails to explicitly acknowledge legal obligations regarding user data privacy. This omission could potentially violate California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or other relevant privacy regulations, which require companies to adhere to specific legal standards for data handling and disclosure, introducing legal risk for Licensee.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'adapted to local laws and languages' and 'by provable electronic means' omits a crucial requirement for ensuring that the terms of use are legally compliant and enforceable in the jurisdictions where Licensee Users are located.

                "explanation": "By omitting 'including reasonable attorneys' fees', the contract weakens VOTOCAST's indemnification obligation. This could violate the principle of 'full indemnification' recognized in California law (where VOTOCAST is located), where the indemnified party (Licensee) is typically entitled to recover all costs associated with defending a claim, including attorney fees. This creates a legal contradiction as it limits Licensee's recovery in a manner potentially inconsistent with California's approach to indemnification.",

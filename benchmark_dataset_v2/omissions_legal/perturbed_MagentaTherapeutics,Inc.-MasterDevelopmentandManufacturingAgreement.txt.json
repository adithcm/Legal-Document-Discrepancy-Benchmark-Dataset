                "original_text": "Bachem shall, during the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms, and [***] after the expiration of the last Product is delivered, obtain and maintain, at its own cost and expense and from a qualified insurance company, comprehensive general liability insurance including, but not limited to, contractual liability coverage and standard product liability coverage in an amount commensurate with industry standards. At Magenta's request, Bachem shall provide Magenta with proof of such coverage. Bachem shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates and sublicensees who perform activities in connection with the manufacture of Product to provide, to Magenta, upon its reasonable request, a statement of coverages, amounts of insurance, and deductibles, and a copy of all policies including clauses within the policies that the insurance company has a duty to defend and indemnify.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'comprehensive,' 'contractual liability coverage,' 'standard product liability coverage,' and 'an amount commensurate with industry standards' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the requirement for Bachem to provide a 'statement of coverages, amounts of insurance, and deductibles, and a copy of all policies including clauses within the policies that the insurance company has a duty to defend and indemnify' eliminates an important compliance measure. This creates a legal contradiction with New York state laws and general business practices that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts and types for manufacturing agreements, specifically in pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

Magenta promptly shall notify Bachem if any Product is the subject of a recall and, to the extent required by Bachem, provide Bachem with a copy of all documents relating to such recall. Bachem shall cooperate fully with Magenta in connection with any recall. Magenta shall be responsible for all of the costs and expenses of such recall, except to the extent that Bachem is determined to be responsible for such recall. In such case, Bachem shall be responsible for such costs and expenses. Such determination of responsibility may be made by the governmental agency involved or by mutual agreement by the Parties following examination and review of all records pertinent to the manufacture of the Product subject to such recall. In case of shared responsibility, the costs should be allocated in accordance with each Party's share of responsibility.",

Bachem shall cooperate with Magenta in connection with any recall. Magenta shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of such recall.",
                "explanation": "By removing the condition that Bachem is responsible for recall costs and expenses if determined to be responsible for the recall by a governmental agency or mutual agreement, and removing the process for determining responsibility, the contract attempts to shift all recall costs to Magenta, irrespective of Bachem's fault. This is a legal contradiction because, according to the FDA regulations and New York law, manufacturers bear the financial responsibility for recalls caused by their actions (e.g., manufacturing defects, contamination). The FDA has the power to enforce recalls, and these costs cannot be fully contractually shifted to the consumer.",

                "original_text": "The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiations between executives who have authority to settle the controversy. Any party may give the other party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within [***] after delivery of said notice, executives of both parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place in the State of New York or as otherwise agreed and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to resolve the dispute. Once the executive of either party determines that additional meetings are not likely to resolve the dispute, each of the parties shall be entitled to terminate such meetings and the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration. The binding arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules and procedures for commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. Unless the parties to such dispute agree otherwise in writing, any such arbitration shall be conducted in New York pursuant to New York law, without any consideration of conflict of law issues, and the results of such arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that each of them shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief through the courts in the event of any material breach by the other party of any provision of this Agreement that would cause the non-breaching party irreparable injury for which there would be no adequate remedy at law. Any such legal proceeding will be brought in the applicable state or federal court of the State of New York, and the parties hereby consent to this exclusive jurisdiction for this purpose.",

Any such legal proceeding will be brought in the applicable state or federal court of the State of New York, and the parties hereby consent to this exclusive jurisdiction for this purpose.",
                "explanation": "The omission of the binding arbitration clause removes a significant alternative dispute resolution mechanism. More importantly, by removing the clause that allows parties to seek 'immediate injunctive and other equitable relief through the courts in the event of any material breach...that would cause irreparable injury,' the modified contract limits Magenta's ability to quickly address critical breaches (e.g., IP theft, supply chain disruption). This omission is problematic because, under New York law, companies have a right to seek injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm. Denying this right contractually creates a legal vulnerability.",

                "explanation": "The changes replace 'obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals' with 'obtain governmental approvals'. This weakens IntriCon's obligation to ensure compliance with applicable laws, potentially creating a legal contradiction if specific regulatory approvals are legally mandated in Victoria, Australia, for the sale of hearing aids. The change replaces 'comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times with any technical standards as may reasonably be required by law' with 'endeavor to ensure that all Products comply with technical standards'. This significantly reduces the responsibility of IntriCon to ensure that all products always comply with applicable technical standards required by law, this creates a legal risk in Victoria, Australia.",

If IntriCon is required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required.",

If IntriCon is required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon will make reasonable efforts to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives the correct amount.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'including any interest or penalties in relation to such tax (Withholding Taxes)' and 'IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required', and instead stating, 'then IntriCon will make reasonable efforts to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives the correct amount', IntriCon is no longer legally obligated to cover the full amount of any withholding taxes, interest, or penalties imposed. This introduces a legal risk and contradiction, because in Australia, the payer (IntriCon) may be legally required to remit the full amount, including any interest or penalties, to the Australian Taxation Office, potentially leaving Dynamic Hearing with a reduced payment.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires 'accurate and complete records' and makes them available 'for inspection, copying and audit' for a period extending one year past the contracts end. This is reduced to 'records' and 'inspection'. The removal of 'accurate and complete' significantly reduces IntriCon's obligation to maintain thorough records, making it difficult for Dynamic Hearing to verify the accuracy of royalty payments. It is in contradiction of commercial law. The removal of 'copying and audit' limits Dynamic Hearing's ability to thoroughly verify records. The removal of one year extension also limits the ability to review past accounts.",

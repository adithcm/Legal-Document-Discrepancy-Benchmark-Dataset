                "original_text": "Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost:\n\n       (a)    obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise, and comply with all laws and  regulations applicable to the exercise of, its license rights under this Agreement; and\n\n       (b)    comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times with any technical standards as may reasonably be required  by law, and any licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers'  Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers'  Patent Partnership (HIMPP), it being  acknowledged that Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under  this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.",
                "changed_text": "Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost:\n\n       (a)    obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise, and comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the exercise of, its license rights under this Agreement; and\n\n       (b)    make reasonable efforts to comply with any technical standards as may be reasonably required by law. Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty regarding compliance with any standards or third-party rights.",
                "explanation": "Removing the explicit obligation to ensure product compliance with technical standards, licensing requirements, and protocols established by HIMSA and HIMPP weakens consumer protections related to product safety and interoperability. Replacing 'comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times' with 'make reasonable efforts to comply' introduces ambiguity and reduces IntriCon's responsibility. This omission allows IntriCon to potentially bypass legally required safety and performance standards for hearing aids, impacting consumer safety and product reliability.",

                "original_text": "All amounts payable by IntriCon under this Agreement must be paid free and clear of and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future withholding tax, including any interest or penalties in relation to such tax (Withholding Taxes). If IntriCon is required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required.",
                "changed_text": "All amounts payable by IntriCon under this Agreement must be paid, subject to any applicable deductions or withholdings.",
                "explanation": "The original clause ensures Dynamic Hearing receives the full agreed amount, even after taxes, by requiring IntriCon to 'gross up' payments. The modified clause removes this obligation, allowing IntriCon to deduct withholding taxes without compensating Dynamic Hearing. This contradicts standard international business practices and tax laws that protect the agreed-upon financial return for the recipient. Australia's tax laws, in particular, would likely be contradicted if Dynamic Hearing does not receive the amount agreed due to IntriCon's deductions.",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for IntriCon to keep 'complete' records and deleting 'all other records reasonably necessary to substantiate all Royalty Payments' significantly reduces the auditability and transparency of IntriCon's sales data. This omission makes it difficult for Dynamic Hearing to verify royalty payments, potentially leading to underreporting and financial loss. It contradicts basic principles of contract law requiring good faith and fair dealing, especially in royalty agreements where accurate record-keeping is essential for proper compensation.",

                "original_text": "Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost:\n(a) obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise, and comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the exercise of, its license rights under this Agreement; and\n(b) comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times with any technical standards as may reasonably be required by law, and any licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Patent Partnership (HIMPP), it being acknowledged that Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.",
                "changed_text": "Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will:\n(a) use reasonable efforts to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise its license rights under this Agreement; and\n(b) use reasonable efforts to ensure that all Products comply with technical standards.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates IntriCon to 'obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals' and to 'ensure that all Products comply' with technical standards. The modified clause weakens these obligations by introducing 'reasonable efforts,' which dilutes IntriCon's responsibility to meet mandatory legal and regulatory requirements. The removal of the guarantee of compliance with Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers' Patent Partnership (HIMPP) creates a loophole that makes the agreement non-compliant, potentially exposing consumers to non-certified products.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction, but generally, consumer protection laws mandate that products meet certain safety and performance standards, and that companies must obtain necessary regulatory approvals before selling products. In Australia, the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) mandates that goods meet certain guarantees, including that they are of acceptable quality and comply with relevant standards.",

If IntriCon is required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required.",
                "changed_text": "4.10 All amounts payable by IntriCon under this Agreement must be paid without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future withholding tax.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally ensures that Dynamic Hearing receives the full agreed-upon amount, even if IntriCon is required to withhold taxes. By omitting the second sentence, the contract no longer mandates IntriCon to gross up the payment to cover withholding taxes. This potentially violates tax laws in Australia, which require withholding tax to be remitted to the government. By not ensuring that Dynamic Hearing receives the originally agreed amount after taxes, Dynamic Hearing is forced to pay the amount on their own. This omission shifts the tax burden onto Dynamic Hearing and potentially exposes them to penalties for non-compliance with Australian tax law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Australian tax law requires withholding tax to be deducted and remitted to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).",

                "explanation": "The original clause excludes all terms and warranties expressed or implied by any legislation, the common law, equity, trade, custom or usage. The modification retains exclusion for terms and warranties implied by trade, custom, or usage but removes the exclusion for those implied by 'any legislation, the common law, equity'. While seeming to 'strengthen' consumer rights, in this context, it serves to create ambiguity and open the door to potential litigation based on vague interpretations of implied terms that are usually explicitly excluded to provide certainty. This contradiction arises from the fact that many legislative acts in Australia regarding consumer protections (and other similar legal codes) aim to be comprehensive. Removing the explicit exclusion opens the door for opportunistic legal challenges based on interpretations contrary to the intent of the existing legislative framework, therefore weakening the intent of consumer protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "The original intent is to adhere to the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) provisions; removing the full explicit exclusion contradicts the intent.",

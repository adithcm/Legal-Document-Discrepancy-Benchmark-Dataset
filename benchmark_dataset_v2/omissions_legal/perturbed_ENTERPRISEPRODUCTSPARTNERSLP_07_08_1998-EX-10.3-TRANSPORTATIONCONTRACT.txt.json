                "original_text": "(a) Claims in writing required. A claim for loss, damage, injury, or delay to      cargo shall not be paid by Carrier unless filed with Carrier in writing, as      provided in subparagraph (b) below. (b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim must be filed with Carrier within     thirty (30) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and     (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Claims in writing required. A claim for loss, damage, injury, or delay to      cargo shall not be paid by Carrier unless filed with Carrier in writing, as      provided in subparagraph (b) below. (b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim must be filed with Carrier within     ten (10) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and     (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or determinable amount of money.",
                "explanation": "The change to reduce the minimum filing requirements from 30 days to 10 days for cargo claims, contradicts the Carmack Amendment, which sets a standard timeframe to file loss and damage claims. This Amendment establishes a minimum time frame for filing claims, and reducing it to 10 days creates a significant legal risk for the carrier.",

                "original_text": "Carrier shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in     writing to the claimant within 120 days after receipt of the claim by     Carrier. Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and     disposed of within 120 days after receipt thereof, Carrier shall at that     time and at the expiration of each succeeding 60 day period while the claim     remains pending, advise the claimant in writing of the status of the claim and the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Carrier shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in     writing to the claimant within 240 days after receipt of the claim by     Carrier. Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and     disposed of within 240 days after receipt thereof, Carrier is not obligated to  advise the claimant in writing of the status of the claim and the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the original text to extend the claim process to 240 days and removing the requirement to inform the claimant in writing about claim status, conflicts with the Carmack Amendment which sets guidelines on claims processing time and communication standards. This change substantially weakens the claimant's right to timely resolution and transparency.",

                "original_text": "A claim for overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection shall not be     paid unless it is filed in writing with Carrier within nine (9) months from the date the shipment in question was delivered and unless all freight bills which are pertinent to the claim have been paid in full.",

                "explanation": "The reduction from nine months to three months to file claims for overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection is in violation of regulations governing freight claims which establish a minimum time to file overcharge claims. By shortening the timeframe, it unduly restricts the claimant's ability to file these claims.",

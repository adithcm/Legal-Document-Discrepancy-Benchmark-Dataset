                "original_text": "Each Party will maintain at its sole cost and expense, an adequate amount of commercial general liability and product liability insurance throughout the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising out of products supplied or activities to be performed under this Agreement and any Quality Agreement related hereto upon such terms (including coverages, deductible limits and self-insured retentions) as are customary in the industry for the products supplied or activities to be conducted by such Party under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, such Bellicum liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial manufacture, sale, use, distribution or marketing of Bellicum Product, and such Miltenyi liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of use of a Miltenyi Product in the manufacture of a Bellicum Product. In addition, from time to time during the Term, each Party shall increase their levels of insurance coverage if reasonably deemed prudent by such Party in light of the overall products supplied and/or activities performed under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon reasonable written request.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may maintain commercial general liability and product liability insurance throughout the Term, to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising out of products supplied or activities to be performed under this Agreement and any Quality Agreement related hereto. The level of insurance coverage shall be determined at each party's discretion. Proof of insurance may be requested by either party.",
                "explanation": "This change omits the 'adequate amount' and 'five-year tail' requirements for liability insurance, as well as the requirement to increase coverage if deemed prudent and written proof of insurance. By removing these components, the contract no longer ensures sufficient insurance coverage is maintained to protect against potential liabilities, creating a **legal contradiction** with general commercial law. For example, in Texas, where Bellicum has its registered office, maintaining adequate insurance is an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially in long-term commercial contracts. This omission introduces legal risk because the contract could be deemed unenforceable if the insurance coverage is insufficient to cover potential damages.",

                "explanation": "Several warranties are removed or weakened:\n1.  Compliance with 'all applicable marketing approvals (if any) and other Applicable Laws' is completely removed.\n2.  'Conform to Product Specifications' becomes 'generally conform to Product Specifications,' weakening the guarantee.\n3.  'Meet quality and purity characteristics' becomes 'meet general quality and purity characteristics,' similarly weakening the guarantee.\n4.  The explicit warranty against adulteration or mislabeling is removed.\n5.  The guarantee of delivery with 'full title and free and clear of any lien or encumbrance' is removed.\n\nThese omissions create **legal contradictions** with basic contract and commercial laws, particularly the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Under the UCC, warranties are implied in the sale of goods, including guarantees of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The explicit disclaimer or significant weakening of these warranties introduces legal risk, as Bellicum may have limited recourse if the Miltenyi Products do not meet minimum quality or regulatory standards. This is especially problematic in the pharmaceutical industry, where strict compliance with laws and regulations is essential.",

A clear, unequivocal waiver is typically required for it to be upheld in court. By changing 'HEREBY WAIVE' to 'MAY CONSIDER WAIVING,' the contract introduces legal risk. A court may find that there was no genuine, informed consent to waive the right to a jury trial. This omission introduces a **legal contradiction** with the legal standards for an enforceable waiver of a constitutional right. If a dispute arises, one party could argue that the waiver was not properly executed, potentially leading to a more costly and time-consuming jury trial. In New York, waivers must be clear, unambiguous, and knowingly made.",

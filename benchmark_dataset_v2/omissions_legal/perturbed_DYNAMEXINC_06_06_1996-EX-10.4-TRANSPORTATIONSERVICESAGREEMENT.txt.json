                "original_text": "A Party shall be liable to the other for loss, damage or delay to Freight due to its acts or omissions, including its negligence, and those of its employees, agents and those for whom in law it is responsible and occurring while Freight is in its care, custody or control. For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be considered\nin the care, custody or control of a Party from the time it is tendered\nto it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of\nits delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as intended. For\ngreater certainty, a Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight\nis damaged solely as a result of improper packing.",

For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be considered in the care, custody or control of a Party from the time it is tendered to it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of its delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as intended. A Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight is damaged solely as a result of improper packing.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be liable' to 'may be liable' and limiting liability to 'gross negligence,' the contract reduces the carrier's responsibility for loss or damage. The original text includes liability for negligence, a standard required by Canadian law for common carriers. The change weakens the protection for the shipper. By only being liable for gross negligence, they are making it far harder to make a claim for loss of freight.",

This weakens the other party's ability to verify and ensure continued coverage, creating a legal risk.

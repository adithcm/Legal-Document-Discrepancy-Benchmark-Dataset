                "explanation": "This weakens the requirements for consumer privacy. By changing 'is responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations' to a weaker 'reasonable efforts,' it creates a loophole. Removing the requirement to state 'whether such information will be provided to third parties, and the choices available regarding collection, use and distribution of the collected information' significantly weakens consumer rights regarding their data. Many jurisdictions, including China where the service is offered, have strict privacy laws requiring explicit consent and transparency regarding data sharing.",

The parties acknowledge the following that establishes timing of payments: (1) Distributor receives a carrier statement saying how much Distributor will be paid; (2) 30-45 days later the Carrier pays Distributor; (3) when Distributor is paid by a carrier, Distributor makes royalty payments to IMNTV.\n\n(e) Exchange Rate.

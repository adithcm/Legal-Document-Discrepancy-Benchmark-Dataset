                "original_text": "FNW agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Sponsor harmless from and against all claims, suits, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney costs and fees, for injury to, including death of, persons (whether they be third persons or employees of either of the parties hereto) or any loss of or damage to property in any manner arising from or relating to the rights",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides broad indemnification to the Sponsor, covering a wide range of claims and expenses, including attorney fees. The modified clause significantly narrows this by limiting indemnification to 'direct' claims and liabilities, and omitting the explicit mention of 'reasonable attorney costs and fees.' This introduces a legal risk as Washington law (RCW 4.84.330 and related case law) often mandates the recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party in contract disputes, and broadly construes indemnification clauses to protect against various losses.",

The determination of who is the prevailing party and the amount of reasonable attorney fees to be paid to the prevailing party shall be decided by the court or courts, including any appellate court, in which such matter is tried, heard or decided, including the court which hears any exceptions made to an arbitration award submitted to it for confirmation as a judgment (with respect to attorneys' fees incurred in such confirmation proceedings), or by the arbitrator(s) (with respect to attorneys' fees incurred prior to and during the arbitration proceedings), as the case may be.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that the prevailing party in any legal dispute related to the contract is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees. The modified clause removes this entitlement, stating that each party bears their own costs. This is a legal contradiction because Washington law (RCW 4.84.330) often implies a right to attorney's fees for the prevailing party, especially in contract enforcement cases. Removing this can be detrimental to a party that successfully enforces the contract.",

                "original_text": "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to a claim based on or arising from an alleged tort will, at the request of any party be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.) under the auspices and rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will be instructed by either or both parties to prepare a list of judges who have retired from the Superior Court of the State of Washington, a higher Washington court or any federal court. 'Within 10 days of receipt of this list, each party may strike one name from the list. The AAA will then appoint an arbitrator from the name(s) remaining on the list. The arbitration will be conducted from Seattle, Washington. Any controversy in interpretation or enforcement of this provision or whether a dispute is arbitrable, will be determined by the arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or in pursuit of an ancillary remedy, does not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with a specific procedure for selecting a retired judge as the arbitrator. It also allows for court judgment on the arbitration award. The modified clause eliminates these specifics and states the arbitrator's decision is 'final and non-appealable.' This is problematic because, under Washington law and the FAA, there are limited grounds for appealing an arbitration decision (e.g., arbitrator misconduct, fraud). Making the decision explicitly 'non-appealable' could be seen as an unenforceable attempt to waive statutory rights to judicial review, creating legal uncertainty and potentially conflicting with FAA provisions allowing challenges to arbitration awards under specific circumstances.",

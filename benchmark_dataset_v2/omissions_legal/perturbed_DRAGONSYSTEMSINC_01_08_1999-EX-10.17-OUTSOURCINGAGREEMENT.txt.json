                "original_text": "Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "changed_text": "Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed, Dragon Systems' sole recourse is to request MMI to re-perform the services. Dragon Systems waives all other remedies, including rights to rescind the contract, refuse payment, or pursue damage claims.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the buyer's right to 'rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims' if services are defective, effectively waiving key consumer protection rights. Massachusetts law provides remedies for breach of contract, including rescission and damages. This contractual clause attempts to limit those rights.",

                "changed_text": "MMI's liability to Dragon Systems under this Agreement is limited to the value of the services provided. MMI shall not be held liable for any indirect or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly limits MMI's liability by capping it at the value of services and excluding indirect or consequential damages. While limitation of liability clauses are common, excluding all consequential damages could conflict with Massachusetts law, especially if MMI's actions cause significant harm beyond the immediate value of the services.",

                "original_text": "MMI warrants that the Services supplied to Dragon Systems will not infringe any third parties' intellectual property rights. MMI will defend and indemnity Dragon Systems against a claim that the Services supplied hereunder infringe a patent or copyright and will pay resulting costs and damages provided that Dragon Systems (i) promptly informs MMI in writing of the claim and (ii) gives MMI sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations. MMI will either procure the right for Dragon Systems to continue using the Services or replace or modify them so that they become non-infringing or accept return of the Services for a credit equal to the price paid by Dragon Systems.",
                "changed_text": "MMI warrants that the Services supplied to Dragon Systems will not knowingly infringe any third parties' intellectual property rights. MMI's liability for infringement claims is limited to the cost of the infringing service.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'knowingly,' the burden of proof shifts to Dragon Systems to prove MMI knew about the infringement. Limiting liability to the cost of the infringing service drastically reduces potential compensation for Dragon Systems, potentially conflicting with typical remedies for intellectual property infringement under US law.",

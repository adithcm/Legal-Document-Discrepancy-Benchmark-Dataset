Neither Party shall use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than in performance of this Agreement or disclose the same to any other Person other than to such of its agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information to implement the terms of this Agreement or enforce its rights under this Agreement. A Receiving Party shall advise any agent who receives such Confidential Information of the confidential nature thereof and of the obligations contained in this Agreement relating thereto, and the Receiving Party shall ensure that all such agents comply with such obligations as if they had been a Party hereto. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall return or destroy all documents, tapes or other media containing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that remain in the Receiving Party's or its agents' possession, except that the Receiving Party may keep one copy of the Confidential Information in the legal department files of the Receiving Party, solely for archival purposes. Such archival copy shall be deemed to be the property of the Disclosing Party, and shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this Article 10. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall have the right to disclose this Agreement or Confidential Information provided hereunder if, in the reasonable opinion of the Receiving Party's legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement, or the requirements of any Law. Where possible, the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of the Receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure pursuant to the provision of the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the Disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the Disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the information. The Receiving Party will cooperate reasonably with the Disclosing Party's efforts to protect the confidentiality of the information. Each Party will be liable for breach of this Article 10 by any of its Affiliates.",

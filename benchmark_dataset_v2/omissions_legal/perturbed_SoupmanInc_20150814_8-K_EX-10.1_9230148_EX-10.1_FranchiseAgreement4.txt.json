                "explanation": "The removal of 'a violation of a franchise, antitrust or securities law; unfair or deceptive practices' significantly reduces the disclosure requirements related to pending litigation. New York law requires franchisors to disclose any pending actions alleging violations of franchise, antitrust, or securities laws, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. By omitting these categories, the contract fails to meet the minimum disclosure standards mandated by New York's franchise regulations, potentially misleading franchisees about the franchisor's legal history.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'violation of a franchise; anti-fraud or securities law; unfair or deceptive practices', this clause now fails to fully disclose the franchisor's history of legal transgressions as required by New York state law. This alteration allows the franchisor to conceal past violations of franchise laws, anti-fraud statutes, and instances of unfair or deceptive practices, thus providing a potentially misleading picture of their legal standing and compliance record. This contradicts New York's franchise disclosure requirements.",

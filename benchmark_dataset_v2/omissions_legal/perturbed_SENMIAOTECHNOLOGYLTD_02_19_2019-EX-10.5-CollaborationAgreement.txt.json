(Depreciation expense can only be charged in that the Driver User unilaterally terminates the Agreement in advance without paying the full amount to buy the vehicle.)\n3.2.13.5 Party B shall refund all the monthly rental paid by the Driver User in accordance with the Financial Leasing Agreement and all the other expenses excluding that paid to the third party (e.g. vehicle purchase tax, insurance premium, etc.).\n3.2.13.6 Party B shall explain the conditions for the termination of the Agreement to the Driver User, fully communicate to reach consensus, and obtain the signature confirmation from the Driver User.\n3.2.13.7 In case that Party B has different conditions for termination of agreement for different types of vehicles, they shall all conform to the provisions of this agreement, and the written consent of Party A shall be obtained in advance before they can be applied to the Financial Leasing Agreement signed with the Driver User.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides specific, legally mandated conditions under which a driver can terminate the lease agreement, protecting the driver's rights. The modified text removes these specific conditions, giving Party B (the leasing company) the freedom to define termination conditions that may be unfavorable or even illegal under Chinese consumer protection laws. This introduces a legal contradiction, where the contract no longer ensures minimum consumer rights regarding early termination of a lease. It also omits the refund part of the policy.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Party B to ensure that Driver Users purchase adequate insurance, especially concerning changes in local laws related to ride-hailing insurance. The modified clause removes the obligation to 'ensure' adequate insurance and replaces it with a discretionary 'may assist', severely weakening consumer protection. This could lead to drivers being underinsured, violating regulations that mandate minimum insurance coverage for ride-hailing vehicles and thereby introducing a legal contradiction.",

If Party B fails to bear the above mentioned amount rejected and compensation, resulting in any losses to Party A or its users, Party B shall compensate Party A for the losses of Party A and Party A shall have the right to terminate this Agreement unilaterally and shall pursue Party B's liability for breach in accordance with Articles 10.3 and 10.6.",

                "explanation": "This clause originally held Party B responsible for covering insurance shortfalls due to violations of insurance requirements, especially in the event of traffic accidents. The modified clause replaces this clear responsibility with a vague 'may be discussed between parties,' eliminating a crucial safety net for drivers and passengers. This directly contradicts consumer protection laws which require businesses to ensure adequate compensation for damages arising from their services.

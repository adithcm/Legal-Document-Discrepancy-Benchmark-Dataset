                "explanation": "Removing the warranty that 'Each party represents and warrants that its conduct hereunder shall conform to all applicable federal, state and local law and regulation' introduces a significant legal risk. By removing this statement, the agreement no longer explicitly commits both parties to abide by all relevant laws and regulations, potentially violating consumer protection laws or other regulatory requirements applicable to healthcare and data privacy. The parties may be engaging in business practices that violate federal or state laws.",

                "changed_text": "●IMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes with two weeks prior written notice by USA MCO.",
                "explanation": "Changing the condition of when IMedicor's records are available for audit removes the immediacy, flexibility, and potentially the thoroughness of the audit. The new requirement of providing 'two weeks prior written notice by USA MCO' limits the ability of USA MCO to conduct an unscheduled audit in the case of suspected malfeasance. The immediate right to audit ensures compliance with consumer and data protection laws. The omission creates a contradiction with laws designed to protect data by allowing enough leeway for illicit action to happen without being caught immediately.",

                "changed_text": "Revenue sharing will be reconciled and funds distributed at the discretion of IMedicor.",
                "explanation": "By changing the terms to make it so that revenue sharing would be paid based on 'the discretion of IMedicor' removes the obligation of a monthly payment and makes the payment optional. A set date is designed to protect USA MCO and prevent IMedicor from withholding rightfully earned revenues. This creates a contradiction with business and contract laws that necessitate payments be sent on time, as well as opening a potential legal risk for IMedicor for delaying/refusing payment.",

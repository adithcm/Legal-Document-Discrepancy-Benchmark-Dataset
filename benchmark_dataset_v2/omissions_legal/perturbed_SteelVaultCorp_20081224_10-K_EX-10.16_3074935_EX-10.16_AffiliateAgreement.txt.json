The modified clause removes the explicit exclusion of implied warranties. This creates a legal risk because under Virginia law (specified in the contract), implied warranties may be applicable, and their explicit exclusion provides a stronger protection for Equidata. Removing the explicit exclusion makes Equidata more vulnerable to claims related to these implied warranties.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives the Marketing Affiliate only 10 days to dispute the fees. By modifiying the text, it provides the Marketing Affiliate 30 days to dispute which is more favorable to the customer. Therefore, the business is losing out on revenue.",

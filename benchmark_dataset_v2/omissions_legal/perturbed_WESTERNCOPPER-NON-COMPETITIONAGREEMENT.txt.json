                "original_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period of 2 years after the Effective Date, it will not, directly or indirectly, either individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with any Person, which will include being a principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor of such Person or in any other manner whatsoever, (a) carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities, or i 162967.3 -4- (b) advise, lend money to, guarantee the debts or obligations of or permit its name to be used by any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities, in the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "changed_text": "Western Copper covenants and agrees with Glamis that, for a period determined at Glamis's sole discretion after the Effective Date, it will not, directly, carry on or be engaged in Mining Activities in the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "explanation": "The original clause prevents Western Copper from engaging in mining activities in a specific area for 2 years. This change removes the 'indirectly' restriction, removes the named relationships like 'principal, agent, shareholder, or advisor' and removes the constraint against advising/lending to others. The deletion of all but 'directly' and specifying Glamis's determination of the period undermine the non-competition agreement, offering almost no real protection to Glamis. This creates a legal risk by rendering the clause unenforceable or easily challenged in court. These edits significantly weakens the non-compete clause, contradicting the presumed intent and potentially applicable laws regarding non-compete enforceability.",

                "original_text": "For a period of 30 days from the time of delivery of the Disposition Notice Glamis will, if requested by Western Silver, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. In the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property. If Glamis and Western Copper are unable to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property within the 30 day period, Glamis may thereafter dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it sees til in its absolute discretion. If Glamis does not dispose of the Designated Mineral Property within a period of 3 months from the first to occur of the date that Glamis and Western Copper acknowledge failure to negotiate an acceptable agreement with respect to the Designated Mineral Property and the end of the 30 day period, the provisions of this section 2.2 will once again apply to any intended disposition of the Designated Mineral Property by Glamis.",
                "changed_text": "Glamis will entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. If Glamis and Western Copper are unable to negotiate an agreement, Glamis may dispose of the Designated Mineral Property as it sees fit in its absolute discretion.",
                "explanation": "This clause grants Western Copper a 'right of first offer'. The modified version eliminates the 30-day negotiation period, the requirement to negotiate in 'good faith', and the 3-month restriction on disposal if an agreement isn't reached. The removal of 'cash consideration' and the time limits effectively guts Western Copper's right of first offer, creating legal risk. The edit is now heavily in favour of Glamis and makes it less likely the 'Right of First Offer' will actually be implemented. This weakening could be seen as an unfair business practice.",

                "changed_text": "Western Copper agrees that all restrictions in this Agreement applicable to them are reasonable and valid, and all defences to the strict enforcement thereof by Western Copper are hereby waived by them.",
                "explanation": "This change removes Glamis's acknowledgement that the restrictions are reasonable and their waiver of defenses to enforcement. This creates an imbalance. Now Western Copper is bound, but Glamis could argue the restrictions are unreasonable or raise other defenses. This introduces legal risk by making Glamis's obligations potentially unenforceable while Western Copper's remain. This disparity could be challenged under fairness doctrines.",

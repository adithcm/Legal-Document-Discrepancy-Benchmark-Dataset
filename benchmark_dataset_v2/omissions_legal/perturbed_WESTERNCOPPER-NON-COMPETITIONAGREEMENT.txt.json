                "original_text": "Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such  breach, in addition to any other remedies available to Glamis at law or otherwise, Glamis will be  entitled, as a matter of right and without the need to prove damage, to apply to a court of  competent jurisdiction for relief by way of injunction, restraining order, decree or otherwise as  may be appropriate to ensure compliance by Western Copper with the provisions of this  Agreement and to restrain any breach of this Agreement by Western Copper. Any remedy  expressly set forth in this ยง3.1 wall be in addition to and not inclusive of or dependent upon the  exercise of any other remedy available to Glamis at law or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such  breach, in addition to other remedies available to Glamis, Glamis may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for relief. Any remedy set forth in this ยง3.1 will be considered with other remedies available to Glamis.",
                "explanation": "The original text ensures Glamis has a 'matter of right' to seek injunctive relief without proving damages. Removing this strengthens Western Copper's position, weakening Glamis's ability to enforce the non-compete. The original clause regarding 'without the need to prove damage' is a standard clause in non-compete agreements which the modification omits which potentially contradicts common law principles for injunctive relief.",

Accordingly, Glamis agrees that in the event of any such breach,  in addition to any other remedies available to Western Copper at law or otherwise, Western  Copper will be entitled, as a matter of right and without the need to prove damage, to apply to a  court of competent jurisdiction for relief by way of injunction, restraining order, decree or  otherwise as may be appropriate to ensure compliance by Glamis with the provisions of this  Agreement and to restrain any breach of this Agreement by Glamis.

Any remedy set forth in this ยง3.2 will be considered with other remedies available to Western Copper.",
                "explanation": "Similar to 3.1, the modified text omits key phrases which ensured Western Copper's legal rights in a breach. Removing the condition of being unable to be 'adequately compensated by monetary award alone' from the original clause ensures that Western Copper must demonstrate the lack of other adequate remedies before being entitled to the requested remedy.",

                "changed_text": "Governing Law\n\n4.8 This Agreement will be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction agreed upon by both parties, potentially including the Province of British Columbia.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the agreement will be governed by the laws of British Columbia and the parties 'attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of British Columbia.' The modification removes the guarantee of British Columbia and introduces ambiguity. This would allow Glamis to argue for a more favorable jurisdiction if a dispute arises, potentially undermining Western Copper's legal standing. Some states have laws that are not friendly to restrictive covenants such as the state of California. The elimination of the jurisdiction is a crucial consumer right, which allows the consumer to know in which jurisdiction any disputes will be arbitrated.",

                "changed_text": "Party B shall follow most instructions of Party A, but compliance with construction laws and regulations is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guarantee that the project will meet relevant construction laws and regulations. In Taiwan, as in many jurisdictions, construction projects must adhere to strict building codes and regulations to ensure safety and structural integrity. Removing the guarantee creates legal risk for Party A, as Party B is no longer explicitly responsible for ensuring legal compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Should both Parties be unable to reach an agreement through negotiation, Party A may choose to pursue other means of resolution.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory arbitration clause and limits Party B's (Chang Chen-Bin Architects Office) ability to seek arbitration. In Taiwan, arbitration is a legally recognized method of dispute resolution, and removing the compulsory nature of arbitration disadvantages Party B, creating a legal risk as it potentially denies them a fair and accessible dispute resolution mechanism.",

In case the Contract cannot be performed due to the architect herein, the architect shall refund the fees paid in full without taking any interest to the client.",
                "changed_text": "In case the Contract cannot be performed due to any reason, fees paid will not be refunded.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the architect's responsibility to refund fees if the contract's non-performance is due to their fault. This contradicts principles of contract law and fairness, where a party at fault is often required to provide restitution. Omitting the refund clause disadvantages the client, Huang Jia Country Club, by removing a recourse option should the architect fail to fulfill their contractual obligations. This is a legal risk because it limits the client's legal remedies.",

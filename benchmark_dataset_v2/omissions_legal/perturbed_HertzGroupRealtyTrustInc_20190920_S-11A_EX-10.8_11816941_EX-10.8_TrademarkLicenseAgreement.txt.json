LICENSOR DOES NOT MAKE WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE LICENSED MARK OR THIS AGREEMENT. 4.2.1 LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND TITLE, AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY OTHERWISE ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OF TRADE OR CUSTOM.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific disclaimer of implied warranties such as MERCHANTABILITY and FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, the contract eliminates clear consumer protections. California law (where the licensor and licensee have their principal place of business), implies certain warranties in commercial transactions. Omitting the explicit disclaimer weakens the licensee's (Hertz Group Realty Trust, Inc.) ability to claim protection under these implied warranties, particularly concerning the suitability of the licensed mark for its intended purpose. This creates a potential legal vulnerability, as the licensee may lack recourse if the licensed mark proves to be unsuitable or defective.",

In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding.",

                "explanation": "By changing the provision for attorney's fees, we remove the right of the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees from the other party. While California law generally allows parties to contractually agree on attorney's fees provisions, eliminating it entirely can disproportionately impact a smaller licensee (Hertz Group Realty Trust, Inc.) that might be deterred from pursuing legitimate claims against the larger licensor (Hertz Investment Group, LLC) due to the high cost of litigation. This omission introduces a practical disadvantage that could be viewed as unconscionable or against public policy, especially if there's a significant power imbalance between the parties.",

Accordingly, Licensed Users agree that in the event of such breach or threatened breach, in addition to remedies at law, Licensor shall have the right to enjoin Licensed Users from the unlawful and/or unauthorized use of the Licensed Trade Name and/or the Licensed Mark and other equitable relief to protect Licensor's rights in the Licensed Mark.",

Accordingly, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, Licensor's remedies shall be limited to monetary damages.",
                "explanation": "By removing the Licensor's right to seek injunctive relief and limiting remedies solely to monetary damages, the contract compromises trademark protection. California law (and federal trademark law) recognizes the importance of injunctive relief in trademark cases to prevent ongoing infringement and protect brand reputation. This limitation of remedies significantly weakens the Licensor's ability to control the use of its trademark by the Licensee and address potential damage to its brand image, creating a loophole where continued misuse might only result in payment for damages already incurred, failing to prevent future harm.",

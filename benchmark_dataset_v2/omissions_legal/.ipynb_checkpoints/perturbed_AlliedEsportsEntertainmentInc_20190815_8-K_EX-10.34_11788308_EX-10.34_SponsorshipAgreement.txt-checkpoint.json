Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA. The Parties unconditionally submit to exclusive jurisdiction of and accept as the exclusive venue for any legal proceeding involving this Agreement the state and federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Before any Party (the \"Complaining Party\") may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \"Non Complaining Party\"), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party's complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing Party in any dispute involving this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the other Party its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (including any fees for expert witnesses, paralegals, or other legal service providers). This Section 15.10 shall not preclude or place any condition on any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",

This Section 15.10 shall preclude any Party from seeking injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies exclusive jurisdiction and a mandatory arbitration clause handled by JAMS. The modification removes the 'exclusive' venue submission, the requirements for good faith dispute resolution, and the mandatory arbitration clause, instead giving Allied Esports sole discretion over dispute resolution. It also precludes either party from seeking injunctive relief. Under California law, parties have the right to seek injunctive relief in certain situations, and the original clause detailing arbitration and pre-litigation dispute resolution is a common protection for both parties.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a comprehensive indemnity, including the obligation to defend the other party and covering various types of claims (breach of contract, personal injury/property damage, and intellectual property infringement). The modified clause removes the 'defend' obligation, significantly weakening the protection. It also removes coverage for personal injury/property damage and IP infringement claims, narrowing the indemnity to only cover breaches of contract. California law recognizes broad indemnification agreements but also imposes limits, particularly concerning one's own negligence. Removing key elements of the indemnity creates a legal risk that the agreement might not adequately protect a party as intended under California law.",

Newegg must provide written notice and give Allied 15 days to cure the breach. This modification removes the fifteen (15) day period and states Newegg only has to give Allied enough time to 'address the breach'.

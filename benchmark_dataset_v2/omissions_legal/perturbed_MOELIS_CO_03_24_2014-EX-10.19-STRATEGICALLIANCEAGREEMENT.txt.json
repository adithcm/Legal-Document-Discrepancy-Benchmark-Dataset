Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall not be obligated to take any action that violates, infringes or conflicts with or prohibited from taking any action required to be in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the parties shall execute and perform this Agreement in compliance with most applicable laws or regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits each party to full compliance with all applicable laws/regulations. The modification weakens this commitment by stating the parties should comply with 'most' applicable laws. This introduces a **legal contradiction** as it implies that non-compliance with certain laws is acceptable, which is against legal principles that compel full adherence to the laws.",

                "original_text": "The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or Federal court sitting in Manhattan, New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties hereby agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party at the address above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any matter relating to the SMBC Unit-Holders' rights or obligations as Limited Partners of Moelis Holdings shall be subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.10 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement and not to this Section 15.8.",
                "changed_text": "The parties submit to the jurisdiction of any court sitting in New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties agree that service of process shall be conducted as per standard legal practice.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains a precise agreement on jurisdiction, service of process, and waiver of certain legal rights (e.g., objecting to venue, right to jury). The revised text eliminates the express consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Manhattan, New York, the agreement on service of process via registered mail, and the waiver of objection to venue. Furthermore, it removes the explicit jury trial waiver. This creates a **legal contradiction**, especially concerning the jury trial waiver since it weakens the protections provided by the original contract, which may not be permissible under certain state laws.",

                "changed_text": "Amendments or modifications to this agreement may be implied through the conduct of the parties involved.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires amendments to be in writing and signed by all parties, ensuring clarity and preventing disputes. The modified text states that 'amendments or modifications to this agreement may be implied through the conduct of the parties involved'. This directly contradicts standard contract law which, depending on jurisdiction, strongly prefers or requires written amendments to complex agreements. By allowing implied amendments through conduct, the contract introduces ambiguity and potential disputes about the agreement's actual terms. It contradicts the principle of clear and unambiguous contractual terms, creating legal risk.",

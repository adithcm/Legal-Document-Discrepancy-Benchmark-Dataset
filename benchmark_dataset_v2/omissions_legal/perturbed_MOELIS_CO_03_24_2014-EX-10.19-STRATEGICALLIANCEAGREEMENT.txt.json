                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each of the Main-Advisor Party and the Sub-Advisor Party shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws or regulations, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and any other similar anti-bribery act in its execution and performance of its services for the Covered Businesses for such Client.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Main-Advisor Party and the Sub-Advisor Party shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws or regulations in its execution and performance of its services for the Covered Businesses for such Client.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"shall comply in all material respects\" with \"shall use reasonable efforts to comply\", the contract weakens the obligation to adhere to anti-bribery laws. This introduces a legal contradiction, as strict compliance is generally required under these laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "UK Bribery Act 2010, US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977",

                "changed_text": "Moelis Holdings will consider whether to open an office in Japan conducting Covered Businesses during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This clause previously restricted Moelis Holdings from opening an office in Japan. By changing \"agrees not to open\" to \"will consider whether to open\", the contract eliminates a restriction that could be important for regulatory compliance in certain international business activities. This omission creates a potential legal risk, as operating without a local presence might affect compliance with Japanese regulations for financial services.",

                "changed_text": "SMBC and Moelis Holdings shall consider cooperating with each other to avoid any of the events in the preceding sentence. Actions taken will be at their sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates 'cooperation' and 'reasonable best efforts' to avoid events that would trigger regulatory oversight under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act. The modified clause weakens this obligation by stating 'consider cooperating' and that 'actions will be at their sole discretion'. This creates a potential legal contradiction by reducing the commitment to comply with regulatory requirements, increasing the risk of violating U.S. banking laws.",

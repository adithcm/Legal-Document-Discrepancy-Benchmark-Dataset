                "explanation": "The removal of the clause referencing 'a breach of the Consultant's obligation in Section 9 herein' limits the consultant's indemnification responsibilities. Further removing 'willful misconduct or fraud' means that even if the consultant engages in such conduct, they are not liable for indemnification.

In the event of any such dispute, the Consultant agrees that the Company shall be entitled, without showing actual damages, to a temporary or permanent injunction restraining conduct of the Consultant pending a determination of such dispute and that no bond or other security shall be required from the Company in connection therewith.

The consultant does not agree that the company can be entitled to, without showing actual damages, a temporary or permanent injunction restraining conduct of the Consultant pending a determination of such dispute. This creates legal risk, especially in situations involving the consultant's actions that might harm the Company's public image.

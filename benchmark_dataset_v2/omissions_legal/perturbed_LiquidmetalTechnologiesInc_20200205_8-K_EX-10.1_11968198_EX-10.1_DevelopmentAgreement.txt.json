                "changed_text": "Liquidmetal will decide when to conduct a Product Corrective Action and the scope of any such Product Corrective Action.",
                "explanation": "Removing Eutectix's mutual decision-making power for product corrective actions violates consumer protection laws. Specifically, it removes the right of the manufacturer (Eutectix) to have a say in product recalls or corrective actions. This could result in unilateral actions by Liquidmetal that may not be in the best interest of consumer safety or may not align with regulatory requirements for recalls. This removal of mutual decision making is a legal contradiction with implied obligations to ensure product safety and compliance.",

The foregoing representations and warranties shall survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal and its Affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns and customers, both direct and indirect.",

                "explanation": "Omitting the survival clause of the warranty after delivery, inspection, and payment limits consumer rights. It contradicts the legal principle that warranties should cover latent defects discovered after purchase. By deleting 'The foregoing representations and warranties shall survive delivery, inspection and payment and shall run in favor of Liquidmetal and its Affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns and customers, both direct and indirect,' the contract suggests that the warranty is void upon acceptance, thus undermining consumer protection.",

                "changed_text": "12.3 Insurance. Eutectix shall obtain, pay for, and maintain insurance as it deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to meet or exceed the minimum insurance requirements outlined in Schedule 2, the contract introduces a legal risk. This is because the original clause ensures that Eutectix has adequate insurance coverage to meet potential liabilities arising from the agreement, as determined by Liquidmetal. Without these minimum requirements, Eutectix may choose to obtain insufficient insurance, leaving Liquidmetal exposed to significant financial risks in case of product defects, injuries, or other liabilities. This is a contradiction to the implied duty to ensure reasonable protection against foreseeable risks and could violate state laws that mandate certain minimum insurance coverage levels for businesses.",

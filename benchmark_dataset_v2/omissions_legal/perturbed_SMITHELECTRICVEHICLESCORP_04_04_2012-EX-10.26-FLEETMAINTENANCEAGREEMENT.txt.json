                "original_text": "4.7 tyre inspections every month, puncture repairs and replacement of tyres with equal to or less than 2mm of tread remaining and in the event of the Company failing to change a tyre with equal to or less than 2mm of tread remaining that is identified on the monthly inspection or which is not available for inspection and the Customer is not informed as such, issue a credit note to the Customer equal to two weeks Maintenance Charge for the Vehicle concerned;",
                "changed_text": "4.7 tyre inspections every month, puncture repairs and replacement of tyres at the company's discretion;",
                "explanation": "By removing the mandatory replacement of tires with less than 2mm of tread and the credit note provision, the contract now allows SEV to avoid replacing dangerously worn tires, potentially violating UK road safety regulations. This omission creates a significant legal risk, as maintaining tires below the legal tread depth violates the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'minimum amount of £5 million' and 'comprehensive' significantly reduces the required insurance coverage. UK law mandates adequate employer's liability insurance and public liability insurance to cover potential damages and injuries. By omitting the minimum coverage amount, the contract may not meet the legal requirements under the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 and could leave DCL exposed to significant uncovered liabilities. By changing to 'general' insurance it removes professional indemnity and product liability, which could leave DCL exposed to damages from poor work or faulty repairs.",

                "explanation": "Altering this clause to allow SEV to determine when VOSA tests are necessary omits the legal requirement for annual vehicle safety tests for commercial vehicles in the UK. VOSA (now DVSA) testing is mandatory, and this change introduces a direct contradiction with UK vehicle safety regulations. This violates the Road Traffic Act 1988 and related regulations.",

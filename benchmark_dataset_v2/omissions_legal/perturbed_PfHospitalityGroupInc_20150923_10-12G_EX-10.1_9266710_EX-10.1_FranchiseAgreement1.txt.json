                "original_text": "Throughout the entire Term, you must maintain such types of insurance, in such amounts, as we may require. Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise. Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following: (a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in the amount of $1,000,000, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000.\n(b) workers'-compensation coverage in the amount of at least $100,000/$500,000/$100,000, unemployment insurance and employer's liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Business is located;\n(c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full-replacement value of the supplies, furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery, inventory, and plate glass having a deductible of not more than $1,000 and naming us as a loss payee;\n(d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in connection with the Franchised Business, with a combination of primary and excess limits of not less than $1,000,000;\n(e) commercial blanket bond in the amount of $100,000; and\n(f) such other insurance, in such amounts, as we reasonably require for our and your protection. At any time, we may adjust the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates the legally required minimum insurance coverage for franchisees. The original text specifies commercial general liability, worker's compensation, fire, automobile liability and other critical insurances. By omitting the specific types and minimum coverage amounts, the contract now grants the franchisor the power to set unreasonably low or inadequate insurance levels, potentially violating Florida statutes requiring businesses to carry certain minimum levels of liability and worker's compensation insurance. This places the franchisee at significant legal and financial risk.",

The certificate of insurance must include a statement by the insurer that the policy or policies may not be canceled, subject to nonrenewal, or materially altered without at least 30 days' prior written notice to us. Upon our request, you must supply us with copies of all insurance policies and proof of payment. Every year, you must send us current certificates of insurance and copies of all insurance policies.",

                "explanation": "This change removes critical requirements for insurance certificates. The original clause mandates that the certificate of insurance must come from an 'approved' insurance company, include a statement regarding non-cancellation or material alteration without 30 days notice, and that you must send current certificates and copies of insurance every year. By deleting these requirements, the franchisor enables the franchisee to use insurance companies of their choosing, with potentially sub-par coverage or cancellation clauses, and eliminates the yearly verification of up-to-date policies, violating Florida law that emphasizes financial responsibility and continued compliance with business insurance laws.",

                "explanation": "By removing the acknowledgement that 'our review and approval of a site...do not constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or guarantee of the suitability of that location,' there's a potential implication that the franchisor *is* providing a form of endorsement, however weak. Florida law protects franchisees against misleading endorsements or guarantees regarding business viability.

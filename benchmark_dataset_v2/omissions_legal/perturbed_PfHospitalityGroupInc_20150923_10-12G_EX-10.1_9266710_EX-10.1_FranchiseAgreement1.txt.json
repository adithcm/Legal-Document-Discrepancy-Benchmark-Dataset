Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise. Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following:\n(a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in the amount of $1,000,000, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000.\n\n(b) workers'-compensation coverage in the amount of at least $100,000/$500,000/$100,000, unemployment insurance and employer's liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Business is located;\n(c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full-replacement value of the supplies, furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery, inventory, and plate glass having a deductible of not more than $1,000 and naming us as a loss payee;\n(d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in connection with the Franchised Business, with a combination of primary and excess limits of not less than $1,000,000;\n(e) commercial blanket bond in the amount of $100,000; and\n(f) such other insurance, in such amounts, as we reasonably require for our and your protection. At any time, we may adjust the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance.",

Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us, and must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following:\n(a) commercial general liability insurance in an amount determined by us.\n\n(b) workers'-compensation coverage, unemployment insurance and employer's liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by us;\n(c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits determined by us;\n(d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in connection with the Franchised Business;\n(e) commercial blanket bond; and\n(f) such other insurance as we require for our and your protection.

                "explanation": "Removing the explicit minimum coverage amounts and the requirement of an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better for the insurance company gives the franchisor complete discretion over insurance requirements. This contradicts state laws that mandate specific minimum insurance coverage for businesses to protect employees and customers. Also, the original text explicitly states: 'Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise'. Deleting this sentence makes it seem that the franchisee does not have to comply with state or federal law.",

                "original_text": "You agree to operate the Franchised Business in full compliance with all applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. You have sole responsibility for such compliance despite any information or advice that we may provide. (To the extent that the requirements of those laws are in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Manuals, or our other instructions, you must: (a) comply with those laws; and (b) immediately give us written notice of the conflict.)",

You have sole responsibility for such compliance. To the extent possible, you should attempt to reconcile any conflict between those laws and the terms of this Agreement, the Manuals, or our other instructions.",
                "explanation": "By removing the franchisee's explicit obligation to comply with laws when they conflict with the franchise agreement and replacing it with an ambiguous 'attempt to reconcile,' this change weakens the franchisee's legal protections. This creates a contradiction because the franchisee would still be legally bound to follow state or federal laws, even if in conflict with the franchise agreement.",

                "original_text": "If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment equal to the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement multiplied by an amount we deem sufficient to cover our losses.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces a specific, albeit potentially harsh, liquidated damages calculation with a completely discretionary amount determined by the franchisor. Many states have laws regulating liquidated damages clauses, requiring them to be a reasonable estimate of actual damages and not punitive. Removing the specific calculation and giving the franchisor complete discretion makes the clause likely unenforceable and potentially illegal as an unconscionable penalty.",

Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise. Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following: (a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in the amount of $1,000,000, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000.\n(b) workers'-compensation coverage in the amount of at least $100,000/$500,000/$100,000, unemployment insurance and employer's liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Business is located;\n(c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full-replacement value of the supplies, furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery, inventory, and plate glass having a deductible of not more than $1,000 and naming us as a loss payee;\n(d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in connection with the Franchised Business, with a combination of primary and excess limits of not less than $1,000,000;\n(e) commercial blanket bond in the amount of $100,000; and\n(f) such other insurance, in such amounts, as we reasonably require for our and your protection. At any time, we may adjust the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance.\n6.19.2. Evidence of Insurance. By the dates specified below, an approved insurance company must issue a certificate of insurance showing compliance with the insurance requirements in this Section 6.19 [Insurance] and you must furnish us with a paid receipt showing the certificate number: (a) 30 days before beginning construction of the Premises; (b) if the Premises are constructed and presently owned or leased by you, 10 days from the Agreement Date; or (c) if the Premises are not presently owned or leased, 10 days after ownership of the Premises is conveyed to you or you sign a lease for the Premises. The certificate of insurance must include a statement by the insurer that the policy or policies may not be canceled, subject to nonrenewal, or materially altered without at least 30 days' prior written notice to us. Upon our request, you must supply us with copies of all insurance policies and proof of payment. Every year, you must send us current certificates of insurance and copies of all insurance policies.",

                "explanation": "By removing the minimum insurance coverage requirements (e.g., commercial general liability of $1,000,000 per person/per occurrence, workers' compensation, fire insurance, automobile liability, commercial blanket bond), the contract no longer guarantees a minimum level of protection, which could be a legal requirement in Florida for businesses operating in the food service industry. Specifically, the removal of the sentence stating, 'The certificate of insurance must include a statement by the insurer that the policy or policies may not be canceled, subject to nonrenewal, or materially altered without at least 30 days' prior written notice to us' opens the franchisee to great risk. Additionally, this violates general business law by failing to meet minimum standards of insurance coverage.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause addressing premises damage or destruction, the franchisee loses the legally mandated right to seek relocation or reconstruction approval in cases of unforeseen events.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and agrees to be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained', the clause now waives punitive damages but fails to explicitly limit the recovery to actual damages. This creates ambiguity. While a waiver of punitive damages can be permissible, it's often scrutinized, especially if it leaves room for unlimited other types of damages like consequential damages which can disproportionately harm a franchisee. Florida law has provisions around what is permissible in contractual waivers, particularly concerning franchise agreements to ensure fairness and good faith. This modification creates a potential legal risk by being vaguely worded and potentially overly broad.",

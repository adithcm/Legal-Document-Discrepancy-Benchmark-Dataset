                "original_text": "Commerce One warrants that the Software and MarketSite.net Service will perform in substantial accordance with the Documentation, and the media on which the Software is distributed will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, for a period of sixty (60) days from the Effective Date, but in no event not later than December 31, 1999 (the \"Warranty Period\"). In addition, Commerce One warrants that during the Warranty Period the Software and MarketSite.net Service is free of any willfully introduced computer virus, or any other similar harmful, malicious or hidden program or data, which is designed to disable, erase, or alter the Software, or any other files, data, or software. If during the Warranty Period the Software and MarketSite.net Service does not perform in substantial compliance with the Documentation, Commerce One shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Software and MarketSite.net Service, or if correction of the Software and MarketSite.net Service is reasonably not possible, replace such Software and MarketSite.net Service free of charge. Commerce One will replace any defective media returned to Commerce One during the Warranty Period. In the event any such breach of warranty can not be reasonably corrected at Commerce One's sole expense, Corio has the right to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of all prepaid fees. The foregoing are Corio's sole and exclusive remedies for breach of product warranty. The warranty set forth above is made to and for the benefit of Corio only.",

                "explanation": "This change removes specific guarantees about the warranty period, virus-free software, and explicit remedies (termination and refund) for breaches, weakening consumer protection. The phrase 'reasonable efforts' creates ambiguity, reducing the obligation to fix defects or provide replacements, thus contradicting implied warranty laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Warranty laws under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted by California (where Corio is located) which mandates a reasonable period and clear remedies for product defects.",

The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of its respective case.",

The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the reference to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and allows Commerce One to determine the arbitration rules. This eliminates consumer protection as AAA provides certain levels of protection during arbitration processes and is a standard in most contracts. Allowing Commerce One to decide may let them choose an organization that favors them.",

Corio or its Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense, in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the indemnification clause. The removal of 'defend and hold harmless,' 'liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),' and the requirement for Commerce One to control defense and settlement shifts responsibility to Corio. Furthermore, the removal of 'its Customers' takes away their protection. Finally, by removing the requirement for Commerce One's 'expense' creates a financial burden on the customer that is not reasonable.",

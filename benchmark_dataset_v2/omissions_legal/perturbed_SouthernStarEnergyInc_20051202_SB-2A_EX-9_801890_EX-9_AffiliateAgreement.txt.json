Developer Agreement between the Software Publisher and element 5. element 5 shall provide the order forms for the order processing on its Web server; receive payments from the referred end users and forward these payments, less the agreed Advertising Cost Compensation, the service fees and relevant value added tax (VAT) to the Software Publisher; handle refunds and returns according to the provisions of the underlying share-it!

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit statement that element 5 handles refunds and returns according to the provisions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement, the contract omits a legally mandated consumer protection. German law (where element 5 is located) and EU consumer law provide specific rights to consumers regarding refunds and returns, particularly for online purchases. By not explicitly stating that these rights are handled according to the underlying agreement, the contract creates ambiguity and potentially weakens consumer rights.",

This includes in particular the liability exclusion for lost profit, the loss of data or interruption to or errors in the operation of the Web site of the Affiliate. The above liability exclusion also applies to the personal liability of employees, representatives and persons employed to perform the obligations of the parties to the agreement.

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase 'The limitation of liability does not apply to claims arising through initial incapacity or in case of justifiable impossibility' weakens consumer protections under German law. German law does not allow for limitations of liability in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

                "explanation": "By omitting 'Even in case of agreements with foreign (non-German) Software Publishers and Affiliates, the law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies,' the contract becomes ambiguous regarding the applicable law. While specifying Cologne as the place of jurisdiction provides some indication, the omission allows for potential disputes over whether German law truly applies, especially if the Affiliate is based outside Germany and their local consumer protection laws offer stronger protections. This creates a legal risk because it undermines the consumer's understanding of their rights and the legal framework governing the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "EU law requires clarity on applicable law and jurisdiction in consumer contracts to ensure consumers can effectively exercise their rights.",

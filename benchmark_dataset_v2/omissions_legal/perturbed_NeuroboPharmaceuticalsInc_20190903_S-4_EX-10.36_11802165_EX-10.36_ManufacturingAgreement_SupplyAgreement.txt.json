Dong-A shall provide NeuroBo with all available information and technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously. If the Product Test indicates that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is deficient in quantity or does not meet the Product Specifications, NeuroBo shall notify Dong-A thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with results of the Product Test. If the quantity is deficient, Dong-A shall immediately ship the sufficient amount of additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency. If Dong-A does not agree that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, the Parties shall refer their disagreement for decision by an independent testing laboratory agreed by the Parties. The decision by the independent testing laboratory shall be conclusive and binding on both Parties, and the losing Party shall bear the costs of the independent testing laboratory. If Dong-A agrees that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, or if the decision by the testing laboratory confirms that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, (i) Dong-A shall arrange for the return from NeuroBo of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at Dong-A's expense, and (ii) without waiting for the return, Dong-A shall promptly replace the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at no additional cost to NeuroBo.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously', removing the obligation for Dong-A to 'immediately ship the sufficient amount of additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency', making 'the decision by the independent testing laboratory shall be conclusive and binding on both Parties, and the losing Party shall bear the costs of the independent testing laboratory' optional, removing 'at Dong-A's expense' from the return of the products and 'at no additional cost to NeuroBo' from replacing the products introduces a legal risk by weakening NeuroBo's rights to receive conforming goods, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to product quality and guarantees, as well as creating ambiguity around responsibility for costs associated with non-conforming goods.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically Article 2, which governs the sale of goods, including provisions regarding warranties, acceptance, rejection, and remedies for breach of contract. Article 2 provides implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The altered text weakens NeuroBo's ability to reject non-conforming goods and receive prompt replacement at no cost, potentially violating the UCC's implied warranty provisions and creating a breach of contract if Dong-A fails to provide conforming goods or appropriate remedies.",

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A.

                "contradicted_law": "The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) requires contracts for the sale of goods to have definite and certain terms, including payment terms. Deleting the specific payment deadline and interest rate clause introduces ambiguity, making the contract potentially unenforceable or subject to legal challenges under UCC Article 2 regarding contract formation and gap-filling provisions. Additionally, usury laws in New York (where the contract is governed) may be violated if the actual interest rate charged exceeds the legal limit, and the contract does not specify a legally compliant interest rate.",

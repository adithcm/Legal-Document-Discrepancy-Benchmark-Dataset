EFS shall implement a privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") applicable to users of the Websites and  the Catalogs that is no less protective of user privacy than is required under the Laws of or otherwise applicable to the Territory.  Such Privacy Policy shall be prominently displayed, as is customary in the industry, within the Websites and the Catalogs and be  easily accessible to users. EFS shall not take any action, and shall not operate the Websites or the Catalogs, in contravention of  such Privacy Policy or of any applicable Law, including, but not limited to, data protection provisions imposed by the United  Sates, the European Union or the other countries of the Territory and other applicable Laws.",

                "explanation": "Removing the mandatory age restriction for customers violates COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) if the website is accessible to children under 13. This introduces a legal risk because it potentially allows the collection of data from minors without parental consent, which is a direct violation of federal law. Additionally, deleting the phrase 'that is no less protective of user privacy than is required under the Laws of or otherwise applicable to the Territory' from the requirement for the Privacy Policy removes the legal mandate to protect user privacy, therefore making it a legal contradiction.",

EFS shall gather, retain in its  records, and take all necessary measures (which may include disclosure in the Privacy Policy and/or an opt-in mechanism) in  order to provide such User Data to Client, as well as information on usage and viewing of the Websites and such additional  information as Client may reasonably request. EFS warrants that it has implemented and will maintain during the Term of this  Agreement an information security program that is reasonably designed to: (a) ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of  User Data collected hereunder; (b) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of User Data; and (c)  protect against unauthorized access to or use of User Data. EFS agrees that included in EFS' information security program are  policies and administrative and technical measures specifically prohibiting and preventing the placement of User Data in or on any  form of mobile media (e.g., CD's or flash drives and other external storage media).

This omission creates a legal contradiction because it allows EFS to potentially avoid paying royalties owed for sales made during the Term, which violates standard contract law principles requiring payment for services rendered or goods sold during the contract period.",

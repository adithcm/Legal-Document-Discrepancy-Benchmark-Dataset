EFS shall implement a privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") applicable to users of the Websites and the Catalogs that is no less protective of user privacy than is required under the Laws of or otherwise applicable to the Territory. Such Privacy Policy shall be prominently displayed, as is customary in the industry, within the Websites and the Catalogs and be easily accessible to users. EFS shall not take any action, and shall not operate the Websites or the Catalogs, in contravention of such Privacy Policy or of any applicable Law, including, but not limited to, data protection provisions imposed by the United Sates, the European Union or the other countries of the Territory and other applicable Laws.",

                "explanation": "This change omits the requirement for the TOU to comply with all applicable laws and the specific requirement to prohibit orders from customers under the age of majority. It also removes the stipulation that the Privacy Policy must be no less protective of user privacy than required by law, and the obligation to comply with data protection laws. This introduces a **legal contradiction** as it weakens consumer protections mandated by various state and federal laws regarding online transactions and privacy, such as COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) in the United States, which requires parental consent for collecting data from children under 13. The removal of 'return policies' from TOU is against consumer protection laws.",

Client and EFS shall jointly own and have rights to all User Data collected hereunder provided, however, that EFS shall only use the User Data in strict accordance with the Privacy Policy and, subject to the remainder of this Section 5, solely in connection with the Playboy Commerce Business. EFS shall gather, retain in its records, and take all necessary measures (which may include disclosure in the Privacy Policy and/or an opt-in mechanism) in order to provide such User Data to Client, as well as information on usage and viewing of the Websites and such additional information as Client may reasonably request. EFS warrants that it has implemented and will maintain during the Term of this Agreement an information security program that is reasonably designed to: (a) ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of User Data collected hereunder; (b) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of User Data; and (c) protect against unauthorized access to or use of User Data. EFS agrees that included in EFS' information security program are policies and administrative and technical measures specifically prohibiting and preventing the placement of User Data in or on any form of mobile media (e.g., CD's or flash drives and other external storage media). EFS shall notify Client immediately in the event EFS believes that User Data collected hereunder has been or potentially could have been accessed by an unauthorized individual and shall cooperate with Client and indemnify Client regarding any investigation or response to a security breach, including any claims, notifications or protection of Client's employees related therewith.",

It also removes the requirement for EFS to cooperate with Client and indemnify Client regarding any investigation or response to a security breach, including any claims, notifications or protection of Client's employees related therewith.

This introduces a **legal contradiction** as it creates a potential loophole where non-compliant merchandise could be sold, violating consumer protection laws and advertising standards. Laws like the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) in the United States require products to meet safety standards, and the omission of the explicit compliance clause weakens the contract's commitment to this legal obligation.",

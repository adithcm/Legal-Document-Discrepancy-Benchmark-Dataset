This release specifically includes any warranty claims, express or implied, related to the Wireless Products.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'This release specifically includes any warranty claims, express or implied, related to the Wireless Products,' the amendment seeks to waive implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are consumer rights protected under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted by most states in the U.S. This omission introduces legal risk as such waivers must be conspicuous and unambiguous, and the added sentence might not meet that standard, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",

                "explanation": "The original text mentions that the Wireless Products will be in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish and additional languages 'where practicable'. By removing this, the contract does not explicitly guarantee availability in these languages. This could violate consumer protection laws in regions where those languages are prevalent, as consumers might expect the products to be localized. Also, it is misleading advertisement as it is not clarified in the agreement what is to be expected by the consumer.",

The Guarantee Forfeiture Payment may be recouped from Licensee's sales of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product and the IDIOCRACY Wireless Product, as set forth in Paragraphs 2(a)(ii) and 2(b)(i) of this Amendment.

                "explanation": "The removal of specific dollar amounts for the 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment' and 'additional minimum recoupable guarantee' introduces ambiguity and potential for dispute. This violates principles of contract law requiring clear and definite terms, and potentially runs afoul of consumer protection laws if the ambiguity disadvantages the licensee. If the original agreement contains some consumer rights or benefits tied to the guarantee amounts (e.g., royalty calculations), omitting these amounts effectively removes transparency and potentially violates fair dealing requirements.",

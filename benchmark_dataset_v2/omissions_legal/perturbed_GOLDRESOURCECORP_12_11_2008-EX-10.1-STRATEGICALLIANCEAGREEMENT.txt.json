                "original_text": "The Company shall comply with all securities regulatory filing requirements on a timely basis in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity, including filing within the periods stipulated under Securities Laws, at the Company's expense, all private placement forms required to be filed by the Company and paying all filing fees required to be paid in connection therewith so that such issuance may lawfully occur without the necessity of filing a prospectus, registration statement or any similar document under the Securities Laws.",
                "changed_text": "The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with securities regulatory filing requirements in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity. The Company will file private placement forms and pay filing fees, but shall not be held liable for delays in processing or any associated penalties.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with securities laws, including timely filings. The revised text weakens this obligation by introducing a 'commercially reasonable efforts' standard and absolving the company of liability for delays and penalties. This contradicts securities laws that require strict adherence to filing deadlines and hold companies accountable for non-compliance. This weakens compliance with SEC regulations which require timely and accurate filings of all material documents.",

                "original_text": "(f) In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless HOC against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which it may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any other public filing by the Company, so long as such statement has not been provided to the Company by HOC for inclusion in such registration statement; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, so long as such omission or alleged omission does not relate to HOC or the manner of sale for the Shares as provided to the Company by HOC; or (iii) any violation of the 1933 Act, any rule or regulation thereunder or any other securities law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to the action or inaction required of the Company in connection therewith. The foregoing indemnification obligation shall extend to the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by HOC in connection with any such loss, claim, damage or liability.",
                "changed_text": "(f) In connection with the foregoing, the Company may indemnify HOC against losses directly resulting from the Company's gross negligence in preparing the registration statement. The indemnification obligation will not extend to the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by HOC.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a broad indemnification to HOC for losses arising from untrue statements, omissions, or violations of securities laws in the registration statement. The modification severely limits this indemnification by restricting it to losses resulting from 'gross negligence' and excluding legal fees. This creates a legal contradiction by reducing the level of protection typically afforded to investors under securities laws, increasing HOC's financial risk if the registration statement contains errors or omissions. Limiting indemnification contradicts standard practice in securities offerings and increases legal risk for HOC.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Act of 1933, specifically sections related to liability for false registration statements and customary indemnification practices.",

                "changed_text": "Any disputes arising under this agreement will be resolved through binding arbitration in a venue of the Company's choosing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for disputes to be resolved in the courts of Colorado. The modified clause mandates binding arbitration, removing the consumer/investor HOC's right to pursue legal action in court. This omission is a legal contradiction because it restricts access to the judicial system, which might violate laws granting investors the right to a jury trial or other legal recourse in cases of contractual disputes or securities law violations. By mandating arbitration, the contract avoids transparency and due process.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) may permit arbitration clauses, but it cannot override state laws that protect consumers' rights to pursue legal action in certain circumstances, particularly regarding securities fraud or breaches of contract.",

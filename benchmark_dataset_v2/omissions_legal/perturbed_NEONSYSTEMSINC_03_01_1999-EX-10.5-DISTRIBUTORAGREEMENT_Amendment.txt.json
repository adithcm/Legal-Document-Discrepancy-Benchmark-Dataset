                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, Licensor shall repay to Licensee the aggregate amount of all Royalty Advances then outstanding' eliminates the Licensor's obligation to refund the Royalty Advance upon termination. This creates a legal risk, as it could be interpreted as an unjust enrichment for the Licensor in some jurisdictions if they retain the advance without providing the licensed products or services, especially in states that have implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'within thirty (30) days' eliminates the mandatory cure period for defaults. In many jurisdictions, a reasonable cure period is implied even if not explicitly stated. Removing this specified cure period and the acceleration clause creates a situation where termination could be immediate and potentially seen as a breach of implied covenant of good faith if deemed unreasonable under Delaware law.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing provision for arbitration\nconcerning the terms of any purchase and sale agreement, and without\nlimiting any other\n\n          conditions that may be included in any such purchase and sale\nagreement, Licensee shall have no obligation to consummate the\nacquisition of the assets of, or stock in, Licensor pursuant to its\nexercise of the Option if Licensee's board of directors should\ndetermine, in its sole discretion, that such acquisition would not be\naccretive to the value of Licensee.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that allows Licensee's board of directors to terminate the acquisition if it is not accretive to the value of Licensee imposes an unconditional obligation to acquire Licensor. Given that Skunkware is based in Delaware, the obligation is subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. By imposing an unconditional obligation, it could be argued that Licensor did not accurately represent the condition of its business. Licensee is compelled to move forward with the acquisition, even in the event of undisclosed liabilities, and is thus subjected to potential damages.",

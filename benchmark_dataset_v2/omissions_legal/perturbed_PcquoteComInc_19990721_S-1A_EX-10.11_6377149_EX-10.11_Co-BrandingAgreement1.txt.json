SUCH LIMITATION SHALL BE THE EXTENT OF PCQ OR ABW'S LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM IN WHICH ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST PCQ OR ABW, AND THE FOREGOING SHALL CONSTITUTE PCQ'S OR ABW'S SOLE REMEDY.  IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH ABW OR PCQ INCUR OR EXPERIENCE ON ACCOUNT OF ENTERING INTO OR RELYING ON THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF PCQ OR ABW HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

                "explanation": "The original clause limits liability to the total charges paid by ABW in the last 12 months, which might be seen as an attempt to limit damages beyond what is legally permissible, depending on the nature of the harm caused. Removing the liability cap altogether introduces more legal risk because it could expose PCQ to unlimited liability, including direct and indirect damages. It might contradict the Illinois' Uniform Commercial Code which requires specific limitations or exclusions of consequential damages to be 'conspicuous'.",

Removing 'truth, accuracy, or completeness of the information received by PCQ from the various exchanges and other sources and conveyed to ABW or for errors, mistakes or omissions therein' reduces the scope of the liability waiver.

                "explanation": "The original disclaimer attempts to limit PC Quote's liability regarding the accuracy and completeness of market data. By removing the part of the disclaimer stating that PC Quote is not liable for the truth, accuracy, or completeness of the data, the contract no longer explicitly protects PC Quote from liability for providing inaccurate or incomplete data. This could create a legal contradiction because under consumer protection laws, particularly in states like Illinois (where PC Quote is based) and New York (where AB Watley is based), companies can be held liable for providing inaccurate information that leads to financial loss. The omission of this key liability protection makes the contract potentially non-compliant.",

                "explanation": "The original clause limits liability to the total charges paid in the last 12 months, offering some financial protection. By removing this cap and the reference to 'operational negligence', the modified clause creates ambiguity. It is more difficult to determine the maximum liability, and leaves out the part about negligance. This removal could be construed as an attempt to circumvent regulations concerning the limits of liability waivers, which are often scrutinized under consumer protection laws. For instance, if PCQ's negligence causes significant financial harm exceeding the original limit, ABW might have a stronger legal argument to challenge the enforceability of the liability clause, particularly in states that disfavor overly broad liability waivers.",

                "explanation": "The original clause includes the preface 'EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN'. Removing this phrase strengthens the warranty disclaimer. In Illinois (applicable law as per section 11), while disclaiming implied warranties is generally permissible, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) requires such disclaimers to be conspicuous and not unconscionable. The complete removal of any exception clause combined with removing 'INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE' makes the disclaimer less balanced. Depending on the context and the nature of the 'SOFTWARE and HYPERFEED' provided, this could be deemed an unconscionable or overly broad disclaimer, especially if essential functionality is not guaranteed, potentially violating consumer protection principles embedded in the UCC.",

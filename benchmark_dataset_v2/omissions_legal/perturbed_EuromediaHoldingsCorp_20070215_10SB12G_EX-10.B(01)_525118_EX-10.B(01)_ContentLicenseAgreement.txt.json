The viewing period for each Licensed Program shall be at least twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, or such longer period as may be agreed to by Rogers and Licensor from time to time (the \"Viewing Period\"). Multiple viewings of the Licensed Program shall be permitted during the Viewing Period for no additional fee and all such viewings shall be considered a single exhibition of the Licensed Program for the purposes of calculating License Fees hereunder.",

                "explanation": "By removing the guaranteed minimum viewing period of 24 hours, the contract now allows Rogers to set viewing periods shorter than what consumer protection laws in Canada may deem reasonable. This weakens consumer rights regarding access to rented content, violating potential provincial laws around fair business practices and consumer protection.",

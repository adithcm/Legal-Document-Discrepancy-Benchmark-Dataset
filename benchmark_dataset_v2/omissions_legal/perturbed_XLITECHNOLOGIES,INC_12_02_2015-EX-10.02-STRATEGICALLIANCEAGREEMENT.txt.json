                "original_text": "In addition to its other obligations under this Agreement, BOSCH shall assist CLIENT in obtaining (and provide all documentation required to obtain) such licenses and/or permits as may be necessary or desirable for the sales and/or Distribution and/or Placement of the Product for city, state and/or federal contract accounts (Exit signs in and on buildings, mandatory safety fixtures, freeway signs, etc...) within the Territory.",
                "changed_text": "In addition to its other obligations under this Agreement, BOSCH may assist CLIENT in obtaining licenses and/or permits for the sales and/or Distribution and/or Placement of the Product within the Territory.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall assist' to 'may assist' and removing the clause about providing all documentation and specific examples related to safety, this modification weakens BOSCH's obligation to ensure the CLIENT can legally sell and distribute the product, potentially violating safety regulations that mandate certain products (like exit signs) meet specific requirements for sale and installation. The removal of 'provide all documentation required to obtain' eliminates a compliance measure.",

                "explanation": "Removing the obligation of the CLIENT to 'defend' BOSCH significantly weakens BOSCH's protection in case of third-party claims. Additionally, limiting the indemnity to only BOSCH and not its related entities (parents, subsidiaries, etc.) further reduces the scope of protection. Deleting 'actions or proceedings of any kind and from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)' introduces significant legal risk because if there is a lawsuit, there is no obligation to pay fees.",

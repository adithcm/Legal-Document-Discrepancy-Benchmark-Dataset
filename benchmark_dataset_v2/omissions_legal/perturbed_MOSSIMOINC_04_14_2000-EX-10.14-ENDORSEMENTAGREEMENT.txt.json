                "original_text": "Company shall provide and maintain, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), and shall cause such policy to be endorsed to state that Duval is an additional named insured thereunder. A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within thirty (30) days of the full execution of this Agreement. Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall provide and maintain commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, and may optionally include Duval as an additional insured. Evidence of such coverage may be provided upon request.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific liability insurance coverage and requires Duval to be named as an additional insured with a minimum coverage limit of $1,000,000. It also requires a certificate of insurance to be furnished and prior notice of policy changes. The modified clause removes the mandatory coverage limit, makes including Duval as an insured optional, eliminates the requirement for a certificate of insurance, and removes the notification requirement for policy changes, weakening Licensor's protection. Under Ohio law (specified in section 21), businesses often need to maintain adequate liability insurance to protect against potential damages and negligence claims. Removing these specific requirements could expose Licensor and Duval to uncovered liabilities.",

                "changed_text": "Past due payments hereunder may bear interest.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a default interest rate for late payments, capped by the maximum permissible under law. The revised clause makes the application of interest discretionary and removes specific interest rate guidelines. This omission is problematic because Ohio law sets specific guidelines for interest rates on commercial debts (Ohio Revised Code Section 1343.01). By removing the definite interest rate and the reference to the legal maximum, the contract becomes vague and potentially unenforceable, and it deprives Licensor of a guaranteed remedy for late payments. This change could expose Licensor to delays in payments without recourse.",

All such arbitration shall take place at the office\nof the American Arbitration Association located in Cleveland, Ohio. Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",
                "changed_text": "In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute may be submitted to arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration in Cleveland, Ohio, under AAA rules, specifies the arbitrator's qualifications, defines discovery rights, and ensures the award is final and binding. The modified clause makes arbitration optional and eliminates all the procedural specifics. This creates a legal risk, as Ohio law (Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2711) outlines specific requirements for enforceable arbitration agreements, including clarity on the process. By removing these, the clause becomes vague and potentially unenforceable, which deprives both parties of a clear dispute resolution mechanism, and might necessitate costly and time-consuming litigation instead.",

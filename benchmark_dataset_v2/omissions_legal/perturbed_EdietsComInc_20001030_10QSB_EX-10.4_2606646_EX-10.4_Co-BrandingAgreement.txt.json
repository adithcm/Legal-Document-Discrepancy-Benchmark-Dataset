Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. In no event shall eDiets disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity any Women.com Data that individually or in the aggregate identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users.",

Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. eDiets may disclose or transfer Women.com Data.",
                "explanation": "By removing the strict requirement to adhere to Women.com's privacy policies and allowing eDiets to disclose Women.com data, this clause now contradicts the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other privacy laws. These laws mandate specific protections for consumer data, including restrictions on its use and transfer. The original clause offered some level of protection, while the modified clause opens the door for potential violations of privacy regulations.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specified jurisdiction of California, San Francisco County. California law (CCP 395) protects consumers by ensuring venue in the county where the contract was signed, the consumer resides, or the injury occurred. The modified clause allows either party to choose the jurisdiction, potentially forcing a consumer to litigate in a distant, inconvenient location, thereby contradicting California's venue protections for consumers.",

INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 Indemnification of Indemnified Parties The Issuer shall and does hereby indemnify and save the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any liability, claim, demand or loss, excluding loss of profits, which the Indemnified Parties may suffer, whether pursuant to statute or otherwise, howsoever arising, in consequence of: (a) any statement or omission in the Prospectus, or otherwise made or omitted by the Issuer in connection with the Offering, being or being alleged to be a misrepresentation; (b) the Issuer not complying with any requirement of applicable legislation of Canada or of British Columbia or Alberta; or (c) any order made or any inquiry, investigation or proceeding commenced, threatened or announced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority in British Columbia, Alberta or Ontario which prevents or restricts trading in or the sale or distribution in British Columbia and Alberta of the Securities.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'does hereby' and 'being alleged to be', the indemnification is weakened. Now it means the misrepresentation has to be proven instead of alleged, thus limiting the rights of the Indemnified Parties and potentially conflicting with securities laws that prioritize investor protection based on reasonable allegations of misrepresentation.",

Any of the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence thereof, at the expense of the Issuer.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'but not required', the Issuer is now REQUIRED to assume the defence. Also, the counsel has to be accepted by the Issuer, not the Indemnified Parties. It implies the Indemnified Parties have no say in who defends them. This contradicts the fundamental right of a party to choose their own legal representation in a dispute. This also undermines the Indemnified Parties ability to adequately defend their interests, thereby reducing a protection intended under Securities Law for underwriters and sponsors.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the survival period of representations and warranties from three years to one year significantly limits the time frame within which a claim can be made for breaches of these representations. This can be problematic as some misrepresentations may not become apparent until after the first year. This reduction undermines the protections provided to investors and other parties who rely on the accuracy of the representations, potentially violating regulations designed to ensure adequate recourse for misstatements or omissions.",

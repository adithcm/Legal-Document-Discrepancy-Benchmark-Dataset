                "original_text": "The Issuer shall and does hereby indemnify and save the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any liability, claim, demand or loss, excluding loss of profits, which the Indemnified Parties may suffer, whether pursuant to statute or otherwise, howsoever arising, in consequence of:\n(a) any statement or omission in the Prospectus, or otherwise made or omitted by the Issuer in connection with the Offering, being or being alleged to be a misrepresentation;\n(b) the Issuer not complying with any requirement of applicable legislation of Canada or of British Columbia or Alberta; or\n(c) any order made or any inquiry, investigation or proceeding commenced, threatened or announced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority in British Columbia, Alberta or Ontario which prevents or restricts trading in or the sale or distribution in British Columbia and Alberta of the Securities.",
                "changed_text": "The Issuer shall indemnify the Indemnified Parties from liability directly caused by gross negligence proven in a court of law. This indemnification covers losses resulting from the Issuer not complying with applicable legislation of Canada.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly narrows the scope of indemnification. By requiring a court finding of 'gross negligence' and removing indemnity for misrepresentations or actions by regulatory bodies in British Columbia, Alberta, or Ontario, it contradicts securities laws that impose broader liability for prospectuses and regulatory compliance. It further removes indemnity for losses resulting from the Issuer not complying with applicable legislation of British Columbia or Alberta, weakening consumer protection.",

Any of the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence thereof, at the expense of the Issuer.",
                "changed_text": "If a claim is asserted, the Issuer may assume the defense. Indemnified Parties may employ separate counsel at their own expense.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for 'legal counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Parties' and eliminates the Issuer's obligation to pay for separate counsel for the Indemnified Parties. This weakens the Indemnified Parties' rights in defending against claims, potentially contradicting legal precedents that ensure fair representation and cost allocation in indemnification scenarios.",

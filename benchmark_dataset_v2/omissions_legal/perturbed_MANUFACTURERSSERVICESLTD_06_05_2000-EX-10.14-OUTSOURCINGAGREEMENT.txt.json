                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall maintain and enforce a corporate policy designed to ensure that its employees, agents, or representatives will not offer any gratuity to the other Party's employees, agents, or representatives for any reason, including a view towards securing favorable treatment from such other Party.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that it shall attempt to maintain a corporate policy designed to ensure that its employees, agents, or representatives will not offer any excessive gratuity to the other Party's employees, agents, or representatives for any reason.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a strict corporate policy against any gratuity. The modified text weakens this by stating 'attempt to maintain,' introducing the term 'excessive,' which is subjective, and eliminating the phrase 'including a view towards securing favorable treatment'. This creates a **legal contradiction** with anti-corruption laws (like the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar state laws) which require companies to have robust policies against bribery and corrupt practices.",

                "changed_text": "In the performance of this Agreement and related Purchase Orders the Parties shall endeavor to comply with the federal laws of the United States, including those affecting price, production, purchase, sale, use and export of Products.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with U.S. laws, including environmental and labor laws. The modified text weakens this commitment by adding 'endeavor to comply,' omitting environmental and labor laws, and limiting the scope to federal laws, potentially excluding relevant state laws. This omission creates a **legal contradiction** with federal and California state labor laws, where the contract is executed.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the obligation for MSL to abide by reasonable requirements by IBM and creates a legal loophole by only agreeing to consider them.

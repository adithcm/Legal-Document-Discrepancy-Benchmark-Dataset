                "explanation": "The original requires all defective FRUs under warranty be returned to MSL. The modified text changes this to allow MSL sole discretion over acceptance and removing MSL's obligation. This significantly weakens consumer rights concerning warranty and may introduce a legal risk. This violates California's implied warranty laws by limiting the avenue available for defective items. By being able to refuse acceptance, the contract avoids the responsibilities placed on them by CA law.",

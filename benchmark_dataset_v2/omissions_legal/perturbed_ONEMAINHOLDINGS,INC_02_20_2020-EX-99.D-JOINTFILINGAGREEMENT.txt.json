                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,', the agreement appears to neglect its obligation to comply with SEC regulations, thus potentially misleading investors about the regulatory adherence of the joint filing.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement' creates ambiguity. It creates doubt as to whether multiple signed copies are legally equivalent. Many states require clear intent that all counterparts form a single binding agreement. The omission introduces potential legal challenges concerning the validity and enforceability of the agreement if signed in counterparts.",

This omission could cause potential disputes about the commencement date of obligations and timelines outlined within the agreement. Establishing a clear and unambiguous start date is vital for contracts.",

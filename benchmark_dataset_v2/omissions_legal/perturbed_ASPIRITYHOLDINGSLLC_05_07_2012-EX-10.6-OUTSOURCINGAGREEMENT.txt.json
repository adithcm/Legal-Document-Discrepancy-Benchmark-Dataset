The Contractor shall establish and maintain at all times during the term of this Agreement files and records (including, without limitation, computerized records) regarding the Notes and the Note Portfolio, with full and correct entries of all transactions or modifications in a reasonably secure, up-to-date manner and in accordance with the following:\n\n(f) Security. The parties shall take appropriate security measures to protect customer nonpublic personal information (\"NPI\"),  as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, Title V, and its implementing regulations, against accidental or unlawful destruction  and unauthorized access, tampering, and copying during storage in either party's computing or paper environment. Access to NPI  must be restricted to only the personnel that have a business need relating to the Renewable Note Program. NPI must be stored in a  secured format within all systems at both parties' location and any other locations where the data may reside. Transmission of such  NPI between the parties or vendors must be done in a secure manner, in a method mutually agreed upon by both parties. Each party will  engage appropriate and industry-standard measures necessary to meet information security guidelines as required by the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act, Title V and its implementing regulations as applicable to such party to effectuate this Agreement.",

The modified version removes almost all of the GLBA compliance details, weakening the security obligations. By only requiring \"commercially reasonable efforts,\" the contract omits the specific safeguards mandated by GLBA, creating a legal contradiction and increased risk of non-compliance. The GLBA requires specific measures to protect customer financial information, and this omission introduces a significant legal risk for the company.",

The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that all information, whether oral or written,  concerning a disclosing party and its business operations, prospects and strategy, which is furnished by the disclosing party to the other party is  deemed to be confidential, restricted and proprietary to the disclosing party (the \"Proprietary Information\"). Proprietary Information supplied shall  not be disclosed, used or reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of, and in accordance with the terms of, this  Agreement and the Indenture. The receiving party shall provide the same care to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of Proprietary Information  as it provides to protect its own proprietary information, including without limitation retaining Proprietary Information in a secure place with limited  access, but in no event shall the receiving party fail to use reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of  Proprietary Information. Unless otherwise specified in writing, all Proprietary Information shall (i) remain the property of the disclosing party, (ii) be  used by the receiving party only for the purpose for which it was intended under this Agreement and the Indenture, and (iii) together with all  copies of such information, be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed upon request of the disclosing party, and, in any event, upon  termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided or contemplated by this Agreement, including Sections 3.02(b) and (e) and 8.05  hereof. Proprietary Information does not include information which is: (a) published or included as disclosure within the Registration Statement or  otherwise available in the public domain through no fault of the receiving party; (b) lawfully received from a third party having rights in the  information without restriction of the third party's right to disseminate the information and without notice of any restriction against its further disclosure; or (c)  produced under order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other similar requirement of a governmental agency or authority, so long as the party required to disclose the information provides the other party with prior notice of such order or requirement and its cooperation to the extent reasonable in preserving its confidentiality. Because damages may be difficult to ascertain, and without limiting any other rights and remedies specified herein, an injunction may be sought against the party who has breached or threatened to breach this Section.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates providing \"the same care\" to protect Proprietary Information as one's own, including secure storage and limited access. This meets a higher standard of confidentiality. The modified version weakens this obligation to simply \"reasonable efforts,\" removing the requirement for the same level of care. This reduces the legal protection for confidential information and decreases compliance with industry-standard confidentiality practices. Removing 'retaining Proprietary Information in a secure place with limited access, but in no event shall the receiving party fail to use reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of Proprietary Information' creates a gap in the security implementations of the agreement.",

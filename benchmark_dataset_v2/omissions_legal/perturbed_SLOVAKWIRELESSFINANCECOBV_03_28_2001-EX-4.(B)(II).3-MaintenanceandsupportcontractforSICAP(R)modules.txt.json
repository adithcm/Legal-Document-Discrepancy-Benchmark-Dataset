                "original_text": "If any payment is not received by Sicap Ltd on the date or dates, as laid down in this clause, or as may be further agreed upon by the parties, then Sicap Ltd has the right to suspend the services to EuroTel until payment has been received. Before suspending the services to EuroTel, a notification from Sicap Ltd will be given.\n\nIn the event of a suspension of services by Sicap Ltd, as a result of a delay or lack of payment by EuroTel, Sicap Ltd will not be responsible for any damages resulting from this suspension.",
                "changed_text": "If any payment is not received by Sicap Ltd on the date or dates, as laid down in this clause, or as may be further agreed upon by the parties, then Sicap Ltd has the right to suspend the services to EuroTel until payment has been received.\n\nIn the event of a suspension of services by Sicap Ltd, as a result of a delay or lack of payment by EuroTel, Sicap Ltd will not be responsible for any damages resulting from this suspension.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for Sicap Ltd to provide notification before suspending services introduces a legal risk. Slovakian law, in line with general EU consumer protection directives, requires service providers to provide reasonable notice before suspending services due to non-payment. Omitting the notification requirement violates this consumer right, potentially leading to legal challenges.",

The offer must be submitted three (3) months in advance and EuroTel may decide within one (1) month to prolong or terminate this maintenance and support contract. If EuroTel doesn't react in writing, the new offer shall be considered as accepted.\n\nAfter the initial period of two years, the maintenance and support contract shall be automatically renewed for a period of one year on each renewal date, unless one of the parties terminates the maintenance and support contract through written notification to the other party in the form of a registered letter with proof of receipt, at least six (6) weeks prior to the renewal date. There shall be no reimbursement of any paid fee.",

                "explanation": "Removing the stipulation that notification of termination must be sent via registered letter with proof of receipt weakens the consumer's ability to prove they properly terminated the contract.

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence requiring EuroTel to report losses in writing, the contract makes it impossible for EuroTel to claim damages even for direct losses. While limiting liability is common, completely barring any claim for damages, even when demonstrably caused by Sicap Ltd's direct negligence, can be considered unconscionable under Slovakian law. EU consumer law also prohibits unfair contract terms that severely disadvantage the consumer, creating legal risk.",

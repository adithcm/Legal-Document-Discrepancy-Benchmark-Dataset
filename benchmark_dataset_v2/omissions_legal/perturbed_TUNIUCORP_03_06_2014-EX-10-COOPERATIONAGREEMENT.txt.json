                "original_text": "Party A and Party B unanimously agree that they will allocate the proceeds generated from cooperation in accordance with thefollowing provisions:\n\nParty B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to charge Service Fee from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",

Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the clause that the Service Fee must be 'on a quarterly basis' and omits the segment stating the service fee will be equal to the amount of profits gained. The original clause ensures there is a connection between the fee and services rendered which is important for regulatory reasons. Omitting the segment could lead to arbitrary charges which may violate laws regarding fair pricing and anti-profiteering in China.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the text 'The non-breaching Party shall waive the right to request termination of this Agreement it may have according to any applicable laws as a result of the violation acts committed by the breaching Party.' This is a critical omission because PRC law allows parties to terminate a contract for breach of contract under certain circumstances. Forcing a waiver of this right could be deemed unconscionable or against public policy, particularly if the breach is severe and renders the contract's purpose unattainable.",

                "original_text": "12.3 The Parties agree that any and all intellectual property researched and developed, created and invented by the Parties (including their employees) in the course of performance of this Agreement shall be owned by Party B. For the purpose of this Article 12.3, \"Intellectual Property\" means the patent, patent application right, trademark, service mark, logo, image, trade name, internet domain name, design right, copyright (including copyright of computer software) and moral rights, database right, right of semiconductor design drawing, utility model, proprietary technology and other intellectual property that are registered and unregistered including those that have applied for registration, as well as all other rights or protection methods with same or similar effect on a global scope.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'Intellectual Property,' the contract becomes ambiguous and potentially violates the spirit, if not the letter, of PRC intellectual property law. Chinese law mandates specific definitions and protections for various forms of IP. Without a clear definition, enforcement of IP rights becomes significantly more difficult, potentially depriving Party A of protections it would otherwise be entitled to, in particular where Party A has created IP. The term Intellectual property is no longer clearly defined which impacts the protection it should receive in China.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with various articles within the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China, the Trademark Law of the People's Republic of China, and the Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China by creating ambiguity regarding the scope of IP rights.",

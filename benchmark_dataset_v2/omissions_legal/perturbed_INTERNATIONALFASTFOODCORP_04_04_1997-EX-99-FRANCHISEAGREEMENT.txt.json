Each policy will name BKC, and its subsidiaries, affiliated and parent companies as an additional insured, and will provide hat the policy cannot be canceled without thirty (30) days prior written notice to BKC, will insure against the liability of BKC for both its and Franchisee's acts or omissions, and will insure the contractual liability of Franchisee under paragraph 13.3 Additionally, Franchisee agrees to carry, at Franchisee's expense, umbrella coverage in an amount which is at all times the equivalent of One Million U.S. Dollars (U.S. $1,000,000) over the basic 18 Comprehensive General Liability insurance per restaurant; except that if Franchisee owns more than ten (10) Burger King Restaurants, the umbrella coverage applicable to all such restaurants need not exceed an mount which is at any time in excess of the equivalent of Ten Million U.S. Dollars (U.S. $10,000,000). The insurance afforded by the policy or policies respecting liability shall not exclude claims, actions or demands brought in the United States or anywhere else outside the country in which the Franchised Restaurant is located and shall not be limited in any way by reason of any insurance which may be maintained by BKC prior to the Commencement Date, Franchisee shall furnish to BKC Certificates of Insurance reflecting that the insurance coverage is in effect pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All policies shall be renewed, and a renewal Certificate of Insurance mailed to BKC at its main office, or at such other location as may be specified by BKC prior to the expiration date of the policies. This obligation of Franchisee to maintain insurance is separate and distinct from its obligation to indemnify BKC under the provisions of Paragraph 13.3 and shall not be affected by reason of the negligence of or a claim of negligence against BKC.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'Comprehensive', specific monetary amounts, notification terms, and the scope of coverage significantly weakens the insurance requirements. Removing the clause that ensures coverage for BKC's omissions creates a **legal contradiction** with standard franchise practices that require adequate liability coverage. By removing requirements about BKC also being insured from potential negligence that affects the Franchisee exposes the consumer to legal risks.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Subject to the provisions of Section 17.6 below,', the agreement allows BKC to pursue legal remedies regardless of dispute resolution agreed in that clause. The omission eliminates the condition that the parties act within the law for dispute resolution for the franchisee. By doing so, it is possible BKC can act regardless of applicable law, exposing the franchisee to potential legal risk.",

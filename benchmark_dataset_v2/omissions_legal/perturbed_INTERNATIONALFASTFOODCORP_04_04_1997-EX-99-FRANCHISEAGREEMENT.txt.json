                "original_text": "Franchisee agrees to carry at its expense during the Term of this Agreement Comprehensive General Liability insurance, including Products Liability and Broad Form Contractual Liability, in an amount which is at all times the local equivalent of not less than One Million U.S. Dollars (U.S. $1,000,000.00) per occurrence for bodily injury and Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S. $500,000.00) per occurrence for property damage, or in such increased amounts as BKC may reasonably request from time to time during the Term of this Agreement.  Each policy will name BKC, and its subsidiaries, affiliated and parent companies as an additional insured, and will provide hat the policy cannot be canceled without thirty (30) days prior written notice to BKC, will insure against the liability of BKC for both its and Franchisee's acts or omissions, and will insure the contractual liability of Franchisee under paragraph 13.3  Additionally, Franchisee agrees to carry, at Franchisee's expense, umbrella coverage in an amount which is at all times the equivalent of One Million U.S. Dollars (U.S. $1,000,000) over the basic Comprehensive General Liability insurance per restaurant; except that if Franchisee owns more than ten (10) Burger King Restaurants, the umbrella coverage applicable to all such restaurants need not exceed an mount which is at any time in excess of the equivalent of Ten Million U.S. Dollars (U.S. $10,000,000).  The insurance afforded by the policy or policies respecting liability shall not exclude claims, actions or demands brought in the United States or anywhere else outside the country in which the Franchised Restaurant is located and shall not be limited in any way by reason of any insurance which may be maintained by BKC prior to the Commencement Date, Franchisee shall furnish to BKC Certificates of Insurance reflecting that the insurance coverage is in effect pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  All policies shall be renewed, and a renewal Certificate of Insurance mailed to BKC at its main office, or at such other location as may be specified by BKC prior to the expiration date of the policies.  This obligation of Franchisee to maintain insurance is separate and distinct from its obligation to indemnify BKC under the provisions of Paragraph 13.3 and shall not be affected by reason of the negligence of or a claim of negligence against BKC.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee agrees to carry at its expense during the Term of this Agreement general liability insurance in amounts that Franchisee deems appropriate. The policy will name BKC, and its subsidiaries, affiliated and parent companies as an additional insured, and will provide that the policy cannot be canceled without ten (10) days prior written notice to BKC and will insure against the liability of BKC for both its and Franchisee's acts or omissions.

This obligation of Franchisee to maintain insurance is separate and distinct from its obligation to indemnify BKC under the provisions of Paragraph 13.3.",
                "explanation": "The removal of specific liability insurance amounts and the specific types of liability coverage like 'Products Liability and Broad Form Contractual Liability', coupled with allowing the Franchisee to determine 'appropriate' amounts, makes the contract non-compliant. There is no mention of umbrella coverage. Reducing the cancellation notice period to 'ten (10) days' does not give BKC enough time to find an alternative. This omission introduces significant legal risk because it fails to ensure adequate protection for BKC against potential liabilities, violating standards expected by the state.",

Such arbitration proceedings shall be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators. The Franchisee Parties shall l appoint one arbitrator, between them, BKC shall each appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as Chair. If said two arbitrators fail to nominate the Chair within thirty (30) days from the date of appointment of the second arbitrator to be appointed, the Chair shall be appointed by the AAA. Unless otherwise provided in this Paragraph, all matters within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act of the United States of America (9 U.S.C. ss.ss.1 et seq.) shall be governed by it. The arbitrators shall have the right to award or include in their award any relief which they deem proper in the circumstances, including with out limitation, money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from date due), specific performance, injunctive relief, legal fees and costs, provided that the arbitrators shall not award exemplary or punitive damages. The award and decision of the arbitrators shall be conclusive and binding upon the Franchisee Parties and BKC and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Franchisee Parties and BKC further expressly agree and consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for the purpose of entering judgment upon any such award of the arbitrators. The Franchisee Parties and BKC further agree to be bound by the provisions of any applicable limitation on the period of time in which claims must be brought under applicable law or this Agreement, whichever is less. The parties further agree that in connection with any such arbitration proceeding, they shall submit or file any claim which would constitute a compulsory counterclaim (as defined by Rule 13 of the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) within the same proceeding as the claim to which it relates. Any such claim which is not submitted or filed as described above shall be barred. This provision  shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and notwithstanding expiration or termination of this Agreement.",

The arbitrator shall be selected by BKC. The arbitration shall take place in Miami, Florida. The arbitrator's decision will be final.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the arbitrator is selected only by BKC introduces bias, and does not allow for fair conditions with the American Arbitration Association standards. Removing the ability to get punitive damages limits recourse to damages available under state and federal law. This clause is not in line with AAA standards, which calls for a neutral selection process.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the part where BKC advises the PRINCIPAL AND FRANCHISEE to take independent advice. Not advising or not including this clause could be a violation, especially if there is a disagreement. Under common law, agreements that are illegal or violate public policy are often considered unenforceable. While this addition might not make the contract strictly illegal, the lack of advising to seek independent advice could be a factor considered by a court when assessing the fairness and enforceability of the agreement, especially in scenarios where there's a significant power imbalance between parties.",

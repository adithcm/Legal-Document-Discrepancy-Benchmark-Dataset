                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the promise to comprehensively develop the land according to national stipulations, including interplanting commercial crops, giving priority to local employees, and paying expenses on schedule. This omission introduces legal risk by potentially violating environmental protection regulations and labor laws that prioritize local employment and fair compensation practices often required in such development projects.",

                "changed_text": "Party B will register a company in Fenyi County before implementing the project.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause that Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction, it creates ambiguity and potential legal issues. Foreign investment promotion policies often include specific tax incentives, land use rights, and other benefits. Omitting the explicit reference to these policies introduces uncertainty and potential non-compliance with laws designed to attract foreign investment.",

                "original_text": "As required by Party B building PV grid-connected power station project, Party A accepts the Cooperation Agreement of 50MWp Photovoltaic Grid-connected Power Generation Project in Yangqiao Town of Fenyi County signed by Party B and Yangqiao Town of Fenyi County, and actively coordinates Yangqiao Town to perform relevant responsibilities.",
                "changed_text": "Party A accepts the Cooperation Agreement of 50MWp Photovoltaic Grid-connected Power Generation Project in Yangqiao Town of Fenyi County signed by Party B and Yangqiao Town of Fenyi County.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'and actively coordinates Yangqiao Town to perform relevant responsibilities' significantly reduces Party A's obligation to ensure the project's smooth operation. This omission could lead to legal disputes if Yangqiao Town fails to fulfill its duties, as the contract no longer explicitly binds Party A to actively coordinate their actions. This contradicts implied obligations under Chinese contract law that require parties to cooperate in good faith to achieve the contract's objectives.",

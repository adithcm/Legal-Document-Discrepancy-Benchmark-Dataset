                "explanation": "Removing the 'at all times during the Term', 'internationally recognized reputation reasonably acceptable to the Repairer', 'in accordance with industry standards', 'Comprehensive' from the liability insurance, and 'having a Combined Single Limit of not less than [*****] any one occurrence' weakens the insurance requirements. This creates a legal contradiction with Brazilian laws and international aviation standards that mandate specific insurance coverage levels for aircraft operations. This omission introduces significant legal risk.",

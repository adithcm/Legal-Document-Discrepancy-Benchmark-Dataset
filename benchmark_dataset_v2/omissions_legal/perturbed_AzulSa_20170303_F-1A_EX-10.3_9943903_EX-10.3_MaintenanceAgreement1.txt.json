                "changed_text": "8.1 Without prejudice to any term and condition under this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain insurance coverage during the Term.  The Company should obtain, if commercially reasonable, Aircraft Hull and Spares All Risks Insurances. The Company should also attempt to obtain General Third Party Legal Liability and Aircraft Passengers and Third Party Legal Liability Insurance in respect of incidents involving Aircraft.  Employer's liability insurance should also be considered.  Regarding Repairer's values to be insured, the Company should consider insurance for: Lease of Stock (Exhibit 8 Clause 2.2) and Advanced Pool Service (Exhibit 15) and Main Elements Service (Exhibit 11).",
                "explanation": "This perturbation significantly weakens the insurance requirements for the Company (AZUL), shifting from a mandatory obligation to a 'best efforts' approach. Removing the requirement for specific insurance types like 'Comprehensive General Third Party Legal Liability' and a 'Combined Single Limit of not less than [*****]' creates a legal risk because Brazilian aviation regulations (if applicable to this agreement) and standard international aviation practices typically mandate minimum liability coverage for aircraft operators.  The 'best efforts' clause is too vague and does not provide sufficient protection to the Repairer (ATR) in case of an incident.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory notice period ([*****] prior written notice) for cancellation or material changes to the insurance policies. This creates a significant legal risk for the Repairer because it removes a crucial safeguard that allows them to ensure continuous coverage, which is essential for protecting their interests and complying with their own regulatory obligations. The new text only requires 'reasonable efforts' to inform, a much weaker obligation.",

The Company also agrees to promptly pay each premium in respect of the aforesaid insurances and in the event of its failure to take out or maintain any such insurance then, without prejudice to any other rights it may have in respect of such failure, the Repairer may do so in its place and recover the cost of doing so from the Company.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement for the Company to provide relevant insurance certificates to the Repairer both at the signing date and upon renewal. The vagueness of 'provide insurance information' weakens the obligation. Removing 'in English' could further complicate verification. The shift from a clear obligation to 'explore options' for the Repairer if the Company fails to maintain insurance significantly reduces the Repairer's legal recourse and increases their risk.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the requirement for 'internationally recognized reputation reasonably acceptable to the Repairer' for the insurers weakens the control over insurance quality. Deleting 'Comprehensive' and the minimum liability coverage makes the insurance requirement significantly weaker and non-compliant with some jurisdictions that mandate minimum coverage for aviation-related activities. Dropping 'not less than the full replacement value' weakens the requirement to fully insure the leased items.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'breach or warranty provisions' and the requirement for prior written notice of cancellation or material change removes key protections for the Repairer. This omission means the insurance can be altered or cancelled without notice, potentially leaving the Repairer uninsured and violating contractual security expectations. This contradicts standard insurance practice and legal principles requiring notification of policy changes.",

Upon each renewal of the relevant insurance policies, the Company shall on reasonable request provide the Repairer with relevant insurance certificates in order to evidence insurance is maintained in accordance with this Clause 8. The Company also agrees to promptly pay each premium in respect of the aforesaid insurances and in the event of its failure to take out or maintain any such insurance then, without prejudice to any other rights it may have in respect of such failure, the Repairer may do so in its place and recover the cost [*****] of doing so from the Company.",

                "explanation": "Removing the mandatory requirement to provide insurance certificates at signing and upon renewal, as well as removing the specification for the certificate to be 'in English' and 'in a form reasonably acceptable to the Repairer' eliminates crucial verification mechanisms. Also removed is the clause where 'the Repairer may do so in its place and recover the cost.' This makes it difficult to verify compliance and creates a legal risk, contradicting standard insurance practices and potentially violating clauses requiring adequate insurance coverage.",

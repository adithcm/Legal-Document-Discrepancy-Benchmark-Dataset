Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products. Each party will, at the other party's request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.",
                "changed_text": "12.4 Insurance. Each party may maintain general liability insurance. Provision of a certificate of insurance is at the discretion of each party.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates comprehensive general liability insurance, including product liability, which is a standard practice to protect against potential liabilities. The modified text makes insurance optional ('may maintain') and removes the mandatory provision of a certificate of insurance. This introduces legal risk because it eliminates the assurance that each party has sufficient coverage to meet their potential obligations, violating standard commercial lease practices where insurance is mandatory to ensure coverage for potential liabilities. California law often requires businesses to carry specific liability insurance. Removing the guarantee of coverage shifts risk unfairly.",

(a)  ENERGOUS warrants that (i) when manufactured in accordance with the Approved Production Specifications, and as implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Specifications, the Products and Product Die will conform to the Product Specifications and will be free from defects that could have been avoided in their design; (ii) the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation and the Deposit Materials do not infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) it did not misappropriate any third party's trade secrets in the development of the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation or the Deposit Materials; and (iv) when delivered (including any software updates if any), no Product will contain any viruses, \"Trojan horses\" or other harmful code.

                "explanation": "The original text provides a detailed product warranty covering conformity to specifications, freedom from design defects, non-infringement of IP rights, and absence of malware, valid for a specific period. The modified text significantly reduces this warranty to basic functionality only and limits the warranty period to the moment the packaging is opened. This change creates a legal contradiction as it omits legally mandated consumer protections, especially regarding product defects and IP infringement, violating consumer protection laws and standard warranty practices. The diminished warranty also fails to provide reasonable assurance of product quality and fitness for purpose, increasing legal risk.",

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles. 19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.",

Each party waives all rights to challenge Energous' decision.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration in San Francisco under ICC rules, providing a structured and neutral dispute resolution process. The modified text allows Energous to unilaterally choose the governing law and dispute resolution method, eliminating the counterparty's right to a fair and predictable legal process. This creates a legal contradiction with principles of contract law, especially the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. By granting Energous complete control over dispute resolution, the agreement becomes unconscionable and potentially unenforceable, as it deprives the counterparty of basic legal rights and protections. This also violates California law, which requires contracts to be fair and reasonable.",

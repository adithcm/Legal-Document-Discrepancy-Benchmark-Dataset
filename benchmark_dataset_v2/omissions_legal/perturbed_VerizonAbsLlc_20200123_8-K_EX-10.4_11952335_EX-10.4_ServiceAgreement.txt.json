                "original_text": "Within ten (10) days following the earlier to occur of (i) a ratings downgrade by each of the Rating Agencies of Verizon to below investment grade, or (ii) a Servicer Termination Event, the Servicer will send a notice to all Obligors indicating (a) that their Receivables have been assigned to the Issuer, and (b)(x) if Cellco has not been removed as Servicer, that the Obligors shall continue to make their payments as they had previously, or (y) if Cellco has been removed as Servicer, the name of the Successor Servicer and any new instructions with respect to their payments. In addition, if the Servicer Termination Event was as a result of the failure of the Marketing Agent to satisfy its obligation to make, or to cause the related Originators to make, required Upgrade Payments pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)(y), then Cellco shall also send a notice to (i) all Obligors who have a continuing right to an upgrade, indicating that Cellco has recently failed to make the necessary prepayments with respect to one or more of its customers in connection with an Upgrade Offer, and that if any Obligor chooses to upgrade and Cellco fails to make the related Upgrade Payment with respect to them, such Obligor will still be required to make payments on his or her original device payment plan agreement, but that such Obligor will have a corresponding recoupment right against his or her new device payment plan agreement with Verizon Wireless, and (ii) all Obligors who had initiated upgrades under an Upgrade Offer, indicating that Cellco had failed to make the relevant Upgrade Payment, and stating that such Obligors will continue to have an obligation to make payments on their original device payment plan agreements, but will have a corresponding right of recoupment against their new device payment plan agreements with Verizon Wireless.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement for Cellco to notify obligors of their recoupment rights in the event of a failed upgrade payment, the modified text removes a legally relevant consumer protection measure. This would violate consumer protection laws that mandates clear communication of rights and remedies to consumers, especially when a service provider fails to meet its obligations.",

The parties acknowledge that the failure of the Marketing Agent to deposit, or to cause the related Originator to deposit, into the Collection Account the related Upgrade Payment or otherwise to pay off the Receivable would constitute a breach by the related Originator of its obligation to the Obligor under the Upgrade Contract and that this breach would adversely affect the value of the Receivables, and give the Obligor a claim in recoupment against the related Originator and a right to offset that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe to the related Originator under the new device payment plan agreement (each such agreement, a \"New Upgrade DPP\") entered into by the related Originator (or its agent, on its behalf) pursuant to the Upgrade Contract. The parties hereto intend that the payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator of the Upgrade Payment as provided in this Section 4.3(g) shall extinguish such Obligor's claim in recoupment against the related Originator and the Obligor's right to offset the amount of that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe under the New Upgrade DPP contemporaneously with such Upgrade Payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator. The parties hereto also intend that the payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator of the Upgrade Payment as provided in Section 2.2.1 of the Marketing Agent Agency Agreement shall extinguish each Obligor's claim in recoupment against the \"Verizon Originator\" described in that Section and the Obligor's right to offset the amount of that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe under the new device payment plan agreement entered into by such Verizon Originator (or its agent, on its behalf) pursuant to the Upgrade Contract as described in that Section 2.2.1 contemporaneously with such Upgrade Payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator.",
                "changed_text": "If any Upgrade Offer has not been terminated and an Obligor satisfies all of the terms and conditions of such Upgrade Offer in respect of a Receivable, the Marketing Agent may deposit, or may cause the related Originator to deposit, into the Collection Account the related Upgrade Payment at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding 'at their discretion' removes the mandatory obligation of the Marketing Agent to deposit upgrade payments. This weakens consumer protection as it allows the company to choose not to fulfill upgrade obligations, potentially harming consumers. This contradicts laws which ensure that companies are obligated to fulfill their offers.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'will deliver' with 'may deliver' and adding 'at their discretion' makes the delivery of the Officer's Certificate optional, eliminating a legally mandated compliance statement.

                "original_text": "Each shipment of Product shall be accompanied by a certificate of analysis describing all current requirements of the Specifications and results of tests performed on such Product and a certificate of conformity certifying that the quantities of Product supplied have been Manufactured, controlled and released according to the Required Standards (\"COA/COC\") as set forth in the applicable Quality Agreement (subject to SutroVax's conduct of the SutroVax Activity Test to confirm Extract meets the SutroVax Activity Criteria). The COA/COC acceptance criteria for each Product shall be set forth in the Specification for such Product.",
                "changed_text": "Each shipment of Product may be accompanied by a document. The acceptance criteria for each Product shall be determined by the supplier.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for a Certificate of Analysis (COA) and Certificate of Conformity (COC) eliminates a key consumer protection. COAs and COCs are standard in pharmaceutical and biologics supply agreements to ensure quality and compliance. By removing this, the contract violates laws that mandate quality control and documentation for pharmaceutical products, potentially endangering consumer safety.",

                "explanation": "This weakens Sutro's obligation to maintain necessary permits and licenses, creating a legal contradiction. Applicable law mandates specific permits and approvals for manufacturing pharmaceuticals; making this discretionary puts SutroVax at risk of receiving non-compliant products.",

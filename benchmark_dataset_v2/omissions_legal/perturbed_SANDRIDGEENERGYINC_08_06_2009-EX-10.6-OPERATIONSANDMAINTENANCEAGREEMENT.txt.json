Operator shall have its insurer(s) waive its right of subrogation against Owner Indemnified Parties on all insurance carried. Unless expressly stated to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or prohibited by applicable law or legal statute, Operator's indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall not be limited by amount or in scope to coverage provided by insurance which is required under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' and adding language that limits the scope of coverage dramatically weakens the protection for the Owner. By limiting Owner's protection, this introduces a contradiction to the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and it might fail to meet basic requirements for reasonable risk transfer via insurance, potentially conflicting with state insurance regulations.",

Operator shall maintain statutory worker's compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates'  employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable  to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability  insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each  employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of  subrogation against Owner.\n\n  (b)   Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this  Agreement\n\n  including, without limitation, bodily injury, death, property damage, independent contractors, products/completed operations,  contractual, and personal injury liability, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars  ($2,000,000) in the annual aggregate.\n\n  (c)   Commercial Automobile Insurance.

                "explanation": "Removing the specific limits and scope of the insurance policies (Commercial, Automobile, Umbrella) weakens the protection afforded to the Owner. This omission creates a legal contradiction because Texas law sets minimum insurance coverage requirements for businesses, and this agreement now fails to explicitly meet those standards, shifting the financial risks in case of accidents or liabilities to the Owner. The omission of 'responsible insurance carriers and/or through a program of self-insurance' gives operator the leverage to have irresponsible insurance carriers.",

The Owner Indemnified Parties' additional insured status will not limit the  application of insurance protection as required by this Agreement which arises out of the Operator's indemnity obligations. These policies shall  provide primary coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties. No  \"other insurance\" clause may be invoked by any insurer. This coverage shall apply whether or not the indemnification is valid. Operator shall  have its insurer(s) waive its right of subrogation against Owner Indemnified Parties on all insurance carried. Unless expressly stated to the  contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or prohibited by applicable law or legal statute, Operator's indemnification obligations under this  Agreement shall not be limited by amount or in scope to coverage provided by insurance which is required under this Agreement.",

Operator's indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall not be limited by amount or in scope to coverage provided by insurance which is required under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' weakens the requirement to name Owner Indemnified Parties as additional insureds and to get a waiver of subrogation, increasing financial risk to the Owner. Also, the deletion of the sentence 'The Owner Indemnified Parties' additional insured status will not limit the application of insurance protection as required by this Agreement which arises out of the Operator's indemnity obligations. These policies shall provide primary coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties. No  \"other insurance\" clause may be invoked by any insurer. This coverage shall apply whether or not the indemnification is valid.' entirely removes important compliance measures.

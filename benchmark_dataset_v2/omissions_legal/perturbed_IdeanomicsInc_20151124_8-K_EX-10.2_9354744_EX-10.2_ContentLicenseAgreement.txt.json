                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of mainland China, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to mainland China removes the application of New York's consumer protection laws, potentially harming Licensee. New York law provides for certain implied warranties and consumer rights that may not be available or as robust in mainland China. Additionally, the contract's original intent was for New York law to govern.",

                "original_text": "Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be settled by a method determined solely by Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Removing the binding arbitration clause and giving Licensor the sole discretion to determine the dispute resolution method undermines Licensee's ability to have a fair and neutral process. This omission impacts Licensee's rights to impartial dispute resolution, potentially violating principles of contract law and fairness, particularly in the context of international business transactions where a neutral forum is crucial.",

                "changed_text": "The Licensor waives any right to trial by jury in any court with respect to any contractual, tortious, or statutory claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim against the other arising out of or connected in any way to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the Licensee's jury trial waiver while maintaining it for the Licensor creates an imbalance of power, violating the principle of equal protection under the law and fundamentally altering the legal recourse available to the Licensee. The Licensee now has a right to a jury trial while the Licensor does not. This undermines fairness and introduces a significant legal risk.",

                "original_text": "Ono shall keep, and require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to Array pursuant to this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. Such records will be open for inspection during such three (3) year period by an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally (the US or Japan) recognized standing (the \"Auditor\"), chosen by Array and reasonably acceptable to Ono for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable by Ono hereunder. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Calendar Year, at reasonable times and on reasonable prior written notice. Such records for any particular calendar quarter shall be subject to no more than one inspection. The Auditor shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.4 shall be at the expense of Array, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [ * ] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period and any unpaid amounts that are discovered shall be paid by Ono, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the rate set forth in Section 7.1 above. The Parties will endeavor in such inspection to minimize disruption of Ono's normal business activities to the extent reasonably practicable. For clarity, while Ono does not engage in the bundling of products as of the Effective Date, in the event that Ono elects in the future to provide a discount for the purchase of a bundle of products that includes a Product, or if its Affiliates or Sublicensees sell Product as part of said discounted bundle, such discount shall be allocated to Product, for purposes of this Agreement, based on the ratio, calculated on a quarterly basis, of Product sales to sales of all of Ono's products sold in the Ono Territory. It is understood that the foregoing audit rights shall include the right to have the Auditor verify Ono's compliance (and the compliance of its Affiliates and Sublicensees) with the above requirements.",

                "explanation": "This change omits several legally required consumer rights for compliance and audits. It shortens the record-keeping duration, removes the requirement for 'complete, true and accurate books', eliminates third-party audits, and removes penalty if error is found, all creating a loophole violating standard accounting practices and transparency laws.",

Promptly following the Effective Date but no later than sixty (60) days before Ono's IND filing for the first Clinical Study in the Ono Territory, the Parties shall enter into such a pharmacovigilance agreement, which shall be applicable to such pre-marketing safety information that will be available from Clinical Studies. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the Parties shall initiate negotiation of a post-marketing safety data exchange agreement, and shall enter into such agreement no later than sixty (60) days before approval of such MAA by Regulatory Authority (or as otherwise agreed by the Parties), which shall be applicable to such post-marketing safety information that will be available from post-marketing experiences with the Product.",

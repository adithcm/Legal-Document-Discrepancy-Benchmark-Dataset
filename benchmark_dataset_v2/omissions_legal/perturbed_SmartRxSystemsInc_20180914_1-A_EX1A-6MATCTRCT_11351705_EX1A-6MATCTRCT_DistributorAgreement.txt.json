Operating costs exclude the cost of space and utilities.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'Liability Insurance of $100/month' eliminates a basic requirement for pharmacy operation, potentially violating Texas state laws regarding pharmacy liability coverage. Many states mandate minimum liability insurance for pharmacies, and the specific omission of the liability insurance clause creates a legal risk for the Customer.",

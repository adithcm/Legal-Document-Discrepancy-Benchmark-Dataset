                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Airspan warrants that during the term of this Agreement, the prices at which Airspan sells to Distributor products supplied under this Agreement shall be no less favorable to the Distributor than those prices at which Airspan sells, at substantially the same time in the United States, similar products and pursuant to similar terms and conditions as those by which Airspan sells Products to the Distributor under this Agreement.  Products shall only be deemed similar if they provide like functionality.  The terms and conditions shall only be deemed similar if the product is supplied pursuant to an agreement or arrangement of similar duration and commitment, provides for similar warranties and after service commitments, involves similar spare part and support commitments, has the same payment and other financial terms, and otherwise has similar terms and conditions.",
                "changed_text": "Airspan will attempt to ensure that the prices at which Airspan sells to Distributor products supplied under this Agreement are competitive.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the guarantee of 'no less favorable' pricing compared to other US distributors, which could be argued as a violation of fair trade practices and anti-discrimination laws. The new language provides no concrete assurance of equivalent pricing, thus creating a loophole.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates the Sherman Antitrust Act and state-level anti-discrimination laws if Airspan systematically charges the distributor higher prices without justification.",

                "original_text": "The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")",
                "changed_text": "The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software will be determined by Airspan's internal policy.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicitly stated 12-month warranty and replacing it with a vague reference to internal policy, the contract becomes non-compliant with implied warranty laws, specifically concerning merchantability. This gives Airspan unchecked discretion to set unreasonably short or restrictive warranties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates the implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which generally provides a reasonable warranty period.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall inform Airspan of its efforts in this connection. Airspan may ship Airspan Products to Distributor.",
                "explanation": "The original text places a clear obligation on the distributor to obtain necessary approvals/registrations before Airspan is obligated to ship products. By making shipping discretionary ('may ship'), Airspan assumes no responsibility for compliance with import/export laws, creating potential liability if the distributor fails to obtain proper documentation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates US export control laws if Airspan knowingly ships products without ensuring compliance with regulations, shifting the entire burden onto the distributor.",

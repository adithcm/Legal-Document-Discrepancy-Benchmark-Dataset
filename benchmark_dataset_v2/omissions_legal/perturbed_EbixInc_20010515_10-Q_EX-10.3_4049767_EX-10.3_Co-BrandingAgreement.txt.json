                "original_text": "5.3 If any of the payments are not received on or before the appropriate dates as described above, About shall have the right to charge ebix interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 6% per year,, calculated from 30 days after the end of the month for which payment is made until the date of ebix's payment of such amount, which interest shall be in addition to such fees due and owing About. In addition, About shall be entitled to its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with any action to collect fees under or to otherwise enforce this Agreement.",

About's costs and expenses in connection with any action to collect fees shall be the sole responsibility of About.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific interest rate and replacing it with discretionary charging, the contract now lacks a clear and fair interest rate term, potentially violating usury laws or fair lending practices. Additionally, removing the entitlement to attorney's fees discourages ebix from enforcing their rights, contradicting the principle of equal legal standing.",

                "explanation": "The modification removes 'expenses (including, without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)' from both indemnification clauses, making eBix and About not responsible for covering legal fees, and introduces a cap on Ebix's liability. This could violate the principle that the indemnifying party should cover all reasonable expenses.

Under typical contract law in the US (and in both Illinois and New York, as specified in 15.4), a party invoking force majeure must demonstrate they took reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the event. Removing this requirement introduces a legal contradiction by making it easier for a party to excuse non-performance due to force majeure, even if they did not act diligently to mitigate the event's impact.",

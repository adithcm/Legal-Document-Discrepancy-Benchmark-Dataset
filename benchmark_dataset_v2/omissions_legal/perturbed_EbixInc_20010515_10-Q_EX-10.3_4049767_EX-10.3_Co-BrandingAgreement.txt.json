                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Illinois or New York law and jurisdiction depending on who initiates the suit. By changing this to Delaware, where both companies are incorporated, and removing the choice of Illinois or New York, it potentially disadvantages consumers. If a consumer is located outside of Delaware and has a claim, they would be forced to litigate in Delaware, increasing their costs and potentially deterring them from pursuing legal action. This could be seen as an attempt to limit consumer access to justice.",

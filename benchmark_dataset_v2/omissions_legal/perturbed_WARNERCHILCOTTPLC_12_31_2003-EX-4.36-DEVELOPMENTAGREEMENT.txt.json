                "original_text": "THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL\n\nOBLIGATIONS LAW.\n\nEach Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Party agrees to commence any such action, suit or proceeding either in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail to such Party's respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Article XIII. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n\nEach Party hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF IRELAND.\n\nEach Party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Party agrees to commence any such action, suit or proceeding in the courts of Ireland. Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document shall be delivered to each party's place of business.\n\nEach Party hereto hereby waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies New York law and jurisdiction. This is changed to Irish law and jurisdiction, and the waiver of jury trial clause is retained. However, removing the specific reference to 'the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law' for the jury trial waiver, combined with the choice of Irish law (where jury trials are extremely rare in civil cases), could be interpreted as an attempt to discourage a jury trial, even if one were legally permissible under certain circumstances within the chosen jurisdiction (if, say, a claim were brought in the US under a theory that allowed for a jury despite the governing law clause).",

                "original_text": "4.1      LEO shall indemnify and hold GALEN and its agents, directors, officers          and employees and representatives harmless from and against any and all          Losses which they may at any time incur by reason of any Action or          Proceeding brought by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or other          third party against GALEN arising out of or resulting from (a) any          misrepresentation, breach of warranty or non-fulfilment of or failure          to perform any agreement or covenant made by LEO in this Agreement, (b)          the use of the Combination Product in any clinical trial, or (c) any          other negligent act or omission of LEO.",
                "changed_text": "4.1      LEO shall indemnify GALEN for Losses resulting from (a) breach of contract. Indemnification shall not extend to any third-party claims.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides broad indemnification to GALEN for various reasons, including third-party claims and negligence. This is significantly narrowed by limiting it to breach of contract and explicitly excluding third-party claims. This contradicts the general principle that companies are liable for their negligence and misrepresentation, potentially violating consumer protection laws related to product liability and misrepresentation if the product harms consumers.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with all applicable laws. By changing it to 'commercially reasonable efforts,' the contract introduces ambiguity and weakens the obligation to comply with the law. This allows for non-compliance if it is deemed too expensive or burdensome. This contradicts the baseline legal requirement to comply with all applicable laws, which includes consumer protection laws, potentially creating legal risks.",

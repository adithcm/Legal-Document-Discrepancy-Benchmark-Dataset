                "original_text": "Both LEO and GALEN shall observe all applicable Laws in effect in fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "LEO and GALEN shall use reasonable efforts to observe applicable Laws in fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that both parties comply with all applicable laws. The modified clause replaces this strict obligation with a \"reasonable efforts\" standard, thereby weakening the commitment to legal compliance. This introduces legal risk because it suggests that non-compliance is acceptable if reasonable efforts were made, even if those efforts were insufficient to achieve full compliance. The concept of 'reasonable efforts' is vague and subject to interpretation, creating a loophole that could be exploited to justify non-compliance with mandatory legal requirements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws requiring strict compliance in pharmaceutical development and marketing; this clause undermines the absolute obligation to comply.",

                "explanation": "The original clause includes the phrase 'to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,' which serves as a safeguard, ensuring that the jury waiver is only effective to the degree allowed by law. By removing this phrase, the modified clause creates an unconditional waiver of the right to a jury trial. Some jurisdictions may have specific limitations on jury waivers (e.g., requiring them to be knowing and voluntary). Removing the original limiting language could render the waiver unenforceable in certain circumstances, thus violating due process or other constitutional protections related to the right to a jury trial.",
                "contradicted_law": "7th Amendment to the United States Constitution, state constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to a jury trial, and state laws governing the enforceability of jury waivers.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that Force Majeure has occurred, the Other Party may consider terminating this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear right for either party to terminate the agreement if a force majeure event continues for at least six months. The changed text removes the certainty of this right and replaces it with a discretionary statement, “may consider terminating this Agreement.” By removing the words, '...is continuing for a period of at least six (6) months, the Other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice,' the modified clause severely weakens the protection afforded to either party in the event of prolonged force majeure. This introduces legal risk by creating ambiguity and uncertainty about the consequences of a prolonged force majeure event.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles regarding material breach and frustration of purpose. Removing a party's right to terminate after a prolonged force majeure event could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the force majeure event fundamentally undermines the purpose of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "Sponsor must obtain, and continuously maintain, at its own expense, the following insurance policies:\n     1. Workers' Compensation in compliance with California's laws, including Employers' Liability with minimum limits of:   $ *** Each Accident; $ *** Disease - Each Employee; $ *** Disease - Policy Limit.\n\n  2. An Insurance Services Office occurrence based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy, including contractual liability and products/completed operations liability coverage with minimum limits of:\n\n$ *** Each Occurrence; $ *** General Aggregate; $ *** Products/Completed Operations Aggregate.\n\nAll insurance policies must be issued by an admitted insurance carrier with an A.M.

All of these policies must contain Cross Liability Endorsements, or their equivalent. Further, coverage for the Additional Insureds shall apply on a primary basis irrespective of any other insurance, whether collectible or not.

                "explanation": "The removal of specific insurance requirements such as Workers' Compensation, Employers' Liability, Commercial General Liability, including the minimum coverage limits, significantly weakens the insurance obligation. Additionally, deleting the annual submission of insurance certificates eliminates a key compliance verification step. This omission creates a legal contradiction because California law mandates specific insurance coverage types and minimum limits for businesses depending on their activities and number of employees. The contract, as modified, would not guarantee compliance with these minimums.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause \"comply with all laws, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities\" allows the sponsor and its invitees not to comply with the law. If this happened, it would create a legal contradiction.",

By removing the ability to recover for loss-of-profits, loss-of-business, special, indirect, consequential, the contract severely limits the injured party's ability to be made whole and to be justly compensated for the harm suffered as a result of a breach, violating California law.",

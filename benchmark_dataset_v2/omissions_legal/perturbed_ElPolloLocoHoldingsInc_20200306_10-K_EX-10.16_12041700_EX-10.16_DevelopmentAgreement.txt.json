                "original_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific liability insurance amount ($1,000,000) eliminates a legally mandated consumer protection. California law requires businesses to maintain adequate liability coverage, especially in the food service industry. This omission makes the contract non-compliant by potentially allowing insufficient coverage.",

All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance policies. All policies shall provide Franchisor with notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clauses regarding the 'certificates of insurance' and the 'entitlement to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco' weakens Franchisor's protection and monitoring capabilities. It omits the crucial evidence that the insurance policies are actually in place and that the Franchisor will be protected if the Developer is at fault. This introduces a significant legal risk. It could also potentially violate California's requirements for demonstrating adequate insurance in franchise agreements.",

Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer's duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer's duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer's negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer's duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens or damages.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost' and the lengthy list of included parties significantly weakens the Franchisor's protection and increases their potential legal costs. Making the 'duty to defend' dependent on the 'ultimate resolution' means the Franchisor must potentially front legal costs. The omission of 'including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever' removes critical protection against employment-related lawsuits, a common risk. This introduces a considerable legal risk and could be seen as an unconscionable contract term under California law.",

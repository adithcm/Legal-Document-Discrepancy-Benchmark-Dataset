The Remarketing Agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the settlement procedures set forth therein with respect to any Remarketing upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent, provided any such modification does not adversely affect the Holders, the Beneficial Owners, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Fund.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'provided any such modification does not adversely affect the Holders, the Beneficial Owners, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Fund,' the Remarketing Agent gains the ability to modify settlement procedures even if it negatively impacts the shareholders of the Fund. This removes a consumer protection regarding their investment.",

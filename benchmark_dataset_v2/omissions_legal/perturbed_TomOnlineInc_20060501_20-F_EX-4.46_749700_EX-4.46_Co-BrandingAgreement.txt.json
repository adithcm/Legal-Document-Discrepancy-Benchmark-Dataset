                "original_text": "The Company will, and Online BVI will cause the Company to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to make available and promote the Online Group's existing payment processing and customer billing and payment gateway methods for the purchase of Skype premium features by Company-Skype Branded Customers, including, without limitation, prepaid card distribution networks, vouchers and mobile payment methods, provided, that all payment processing and customer billing and payment gateway charges for such payment methods are on terms that are as or more favourable than the most favourable pricing and terms for such services otherwise provided at the applicable time by any member of the Online Group, and provided further that such pricing and terms have first been mutually approved in writing by the Parties.",

                "explanation": "The original clause ensures commercially reasonable efforts to provide various payment methods, including prepaid cards. Removing the 'commercially reasonable efforts' and the mention of 'vouchers' and 'mobile payment methods', coupled with the elimination of the condition that terms be favorable, weakens the consumer's ability to easily access and pay for premium services. It may violate consumer protection laws in jurisdictions (including Luxembourg and the UK, given the involved companies) that require accessibility and transparency in payment processing for digital services.",

To the extent practicable and otherwise not adversely affecting the rights of Skype therein, Skype shall cause the provisions of the EULA to comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and/or policies/practices of the telecommunications operators and handset manufacturers in the PRC that are requested in writing by Online BVI and/or the Company and delivered to Skype in advance, and which are agreeable to both parties. If Skype is unwilling to modify its EULA and counsel for the Company or Skype provides Skype with a legal opinion that unless modifications are made to the EULA the Company will thereafter be in material violation of applicable laws of the PRC and Skype nevertheless elects not to make such modifications as are necessary to comply with the laws of the PRC, the Company, Online BVI or Skype may thereafter terminate this Agreement by delivery to the other parties 30 days written notice of termination. Upon any such termination, the Parties will comply with the other provisions surviving termination hereunder, including, without limitation, Section 6.3.",

                "explanation": "The original clause includes a provision that Skype will try to make the EULA comply with PRC laws and regulations as much as possible. Omitting this, along with the associated termination clause if compliance isn't achieved, removes a safeguard for consumer rights under PRC law. This increases the risk of the EULA conflicting with PRC consumer protection regulations, such as those related to data privacy and unfair contract terms. It eliminates the recourse for Online BVI and the Company should the EULA violate PRC law.",

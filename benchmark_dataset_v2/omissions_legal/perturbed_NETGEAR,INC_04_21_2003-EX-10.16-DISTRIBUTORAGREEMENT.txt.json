Distributor should return the product to NETGEAR, [*]. NETGEAR will not accept collect shipments. Any Product returned to NETGEAR, which is not returned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, may be rejected.",

Any Product returned to NETGEAR, which is not returned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, may be rejected.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the mandatory RMA requirement, making it discretionary. By introducing a 'may need' clause and deleting '[*}', the Distributor now bears an undue burden of cost associated with returning a potentially defective product. This contradicts implied warranty of merchantability.",

At intervals to be mutually agreed upon between NETGEAR and Distributor. Distributor shall contact NETGEAR to receive a Return Material Authorization number for the collected failed Product. Upon receipt of the failed Product, NETGEAR shall issue a credit to Distributor for Distributor's purchase price of the replacement Product issued, less any prior credits or allowances.

                "explanation": "This change removes the warranty period and removes the RMA requirement. Removing the 'respective warranty period which begins on the date of purchase by the end user' removes a critical component of the warranty, making it difficult for end-users to claim warranty coverage. The addition of the word 'may' weakens the obligation to replace. These changes violate consumer protection laws requiring clear warranty terms.",

                "explanation": "By weakening the compliance obligation to a mere attempt ('may attempt'), the contract undermines the legal requirement for adherence to applicable laws. This introduces a legal risk because it suggests that non-compliance is a possibility, which is unlawful.",

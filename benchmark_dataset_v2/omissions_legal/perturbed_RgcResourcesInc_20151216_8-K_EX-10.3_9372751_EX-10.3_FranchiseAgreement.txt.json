                "changed_text": "Grantee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law relating to discrimination in employment' from the non-discrimination clause, the contract now contradicts state (Virginia) and federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on age and disability in employment. This omission creates legal risk for the Grantee.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to maintain a business office open at least forty (40) hours per week, the contract now potentially contradicts implied obligations to provide reasonable access for customers. While not a directly stated legal mandate, failing to maintain reasonable access could be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, leading to legal challenges, particularly for vulnerable customers who rely on in-person services. Virginia Consumer Protection Act could be violated by this change.",

                "original_text": "D2 shall make available to LICENSEE the maintenance and support services according to the terms of this Article 6 for a minimum of five years after Acceptance of Licensed Technology.",
                "changed_text": "D2 shall make available to LICENSEE the maintenance and support services according to the terms of this Article 6 for a period determined by D2 after Acceptance of Licensed Technology.",
                "explanation": "By removing the commitment to provide maintenance and support services for a minimum of five years and replacing it with 'a period determined by D2', D2 is no longer obligated to provide long-term support. This omission creates a legal risk because it deprives the licensee of a guaranteed support period, potentially violating consumer protection laws that require reasonable support periods for licensed software.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring 'reasonable' terms; potential violation of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, depending on jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the specific schedule for error correction and replacing them with 'To be determined' violates consumer laws that mandate a reasonable response time for critical defects. This is a significant detriment to the licensee as there is no defined obligation for timely error correction, creating a legal risk of non-compliance with industry standards for software maintenance agreements.",

                "original_text": "The runtime license fees is fully paid up after it reaches the CAP, which is the cumulative runtime license fees paid by LICENSEE for the first 75,000 processors as specified in Table 1 above. The CAP is cumulative across the Texas Instruments TMS320C54x, TMS320CSSx, and TMS320C6x, and other TI processors based on the same core processor architecture.",
                "changed_text": "The runtime license fees may be considered fully paid up after reaching a certain amount. This amount is determined solely by D2. The determination of amount is subject to change without notice.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific CAP (cumulative runtime license fees) after 75,000 processors and giving D2 sole discretion to determine it removes a financial predictability element for the licensee and create uncertainty. The addition of 'The determination of amount is subject to change without notice.' makes it worse as there is no protection. This creates a potential issue around fairness and good faith, potentially violating laws related to fair business practices. By giving D2 unilateral control over licensing fees, the contract becomes commercially unreasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of good faith and fair dealing, potential violation of state unfair business practices acts.",

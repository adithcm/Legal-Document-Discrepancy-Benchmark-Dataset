                "explanation": "Removing 'production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards' eliminates a critical aspect of mandated regulatory compliance. Investment advisors have a legal and fiduciary duty to provide regular and accurate reporting to their clients and fund boards. Omission of this duty creates a loophole where Federated Advisory Services Company (FASC) is not explicitly bound to this crucial service.",

                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by the laws applicable to the parties.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specific jurisdiction of 'the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania' and replacing it with a general statement, the contract creates ambiguity about which laws govern the agreement. This vagueness can be used to evade consumer protection laws or regulatory requirements that are specific to Pennsylvania, such as those related to investment advisory services and fiduciary responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support' to 'Federated Advisory Services Company may provide support' weakens the obligation to provide the mentioned support. This implies the support is optional instead of mandatory, allowing FASC to avoid liabilities related to the failure to offer necessary support to portfolio managers. Portfolio support might be viewed as optional, directly affecting the standard of care delivered.",

                "original_text": "SRP shall provide at its expense, and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement, comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of Five Million Dollars and No/100's ($5,000,000.00) per occurrence with respect to any liability relating to the activities of SRP in the performance of this Agreement SRP shall supply Logan's with a copy of the Certificate of Insurance naming Logan's as an additional insured. Such policies shall provide for at least fifteen (15) days' written notice to Logan's of the cancellation or substantial modification thereof. Such insurance will be supplemental coverage in excess of the Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) primary coverage provided to SRP and Logan's by the comprehensive liability policy of NMS.",

SRP shall supply Logan's with a Certificate of Insurance. Notice of cancellation or modification is not required.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific amount ($5,000,000.00) of insurance coverage, the 'comprehensive' modifier, the requirement for 15 days written notice of cancellation, and the statement about supplemental coverage weaken the protection for Logan's and potentially violates standard business practice requiring adequate liability coverage and notification procedures, introducing legal risk by failing to ensure adequate financial protection against potential liabilities. In Tennessee, businesses are generally expected to carry sufficient insurance to cover potential liabilities, and failure to do so could result in legal challenges.",

Any associate sponsor graphics appearing on the Transporter will be displayed in a subservient manner to clearly reflect Logan's as the primary sponsor of the Team.",

Any associate sponsor graphics appearing on the Transporter will be displayed in a manner that does not clearly reflect Logan's as the primary sponsor of the Team.",
                "explanation": "By removing the cost allowance of $2,500 for Logan's graphics and stating that associate sponsor graphics won't clearly reflect Logan's as the primary sponsor, it diminishes Logan's exclusivity and visibility. This omission contradicts the original intention of the contract, which was to promote Logan's restaurant concept primarily. This can lead to a breach of contract claim as SRP may prioritize other sponsors over Logan's, thereby diminishing the value of Logan's sponsorship. This affects contract law relating to fulfillment of contractual obligations and potential breach of contract due to failure to provide the agreed-upon benefits of primary sponsorship. In Tennessee, contracts are interpreted based on the plain meaning of their terms and the intent of the parties, and this modification undermines that intent.",

                "original_text": "To facilitate this aim and in recognition of Logan's sensitivity to any adverse publicity with respect to the Driver and the Racing Team, SRP shall be responsible for the public image of the Driver and the Racing Team at all times, including but not limited to any statement by the Driver or the Team in connection with press conferences, media contact and any contact of the Driver or Team with the general public, whether at a race or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "To facilitate this aim, SRP shall be responsible for the public image of the Driver and the Racing Team only during scheduled racing events.",
                "explanation": "Limiting SRP's responsibility for the public image of the driver and team to only scheduled racing events removes the crucial protection for Logan's against adverse publicity arising from the Driver's or Team's actions outside of races. By limiting SRP's responsibility, the modified clause fails to safeguard Logan's brand reputation, potentially exposing it to reputational damage. This omission introduces a legal risk because it removes a key protective measure for Logan's brand, leaving them vulnerable to potential damages from negative publicity. Under Tennessee law, businesses can be held liable for damages to reputation (defamation, etc.), and this omission increases that risk for Logan's.",

                "changed_text": "F. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'Without giving effect to its choice of law principles,' the contract now defaults to Missouri's choice of law rules. This could potentially allow the contract to be interpreted under laws of a different state if Missouri's choice of law rules dictate that. If that other state offers fewer consumer protections or has laws less favorable to one party (potentially COOL TECH if VET TECH drafts the agreement), this change creates a legal risk by potentially depriving COOL TECH of the originally agreed-upon protections under Missouri law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Missouri's principles of contract law and conflicts of law. RSMo 400.1-301, which governs choice of law in contracts, and the common law principles determining which state's laws apply based on factors like the location of the parties and the subject matter of the contract.",

                "changed_text": "VET TECH may bill the client directly for COOL TECH Services. COOL TECH shall bill VET TECH an amount for the engagement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'pre-agreed amount' and 'as adjusted by any client-approved change orders' language creates ambiguity. This allows VET TECH to potentially charge COOL TECH a different amount than initially agreed upon, or to refuse to honor change orders that would otherwise adjust the price. This opens the door to potential disputes and unfair business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Missouri contract law requires consideration and mutual agreement on essential terms. By making the billing amount uncertain, the altered clause becomes potentially unenforceable due to lack of clarity regarding a key term, thereby violating Missouri contract law principles (Missouri Revised Statutes, Chapter 431).",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'or to engage as independent contractors' and the 'six (6) months following expiration or termination of this Agreement except as may be mutually agreed in writing,' the agreement now allows each company to solicit the others independent contractors after the agreement ends or any time during the agreement. This might be seen as an unfair labor practice violating an implied duty of good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "While not a direct violation of a specific Missouri statute regarding non-solicitation, this change weakens the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts under Missouri law (e.g., *Missouri Gas Energy v. City of Sikeston*, 96 S.W.3d 919 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003)).",

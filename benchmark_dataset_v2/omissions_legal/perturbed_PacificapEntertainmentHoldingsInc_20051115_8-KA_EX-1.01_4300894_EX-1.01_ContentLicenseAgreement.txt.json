                "original_text": "ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SETTLED VIA BINDING ARBITRATION ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS SET FORTH BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY , THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.",
                "changed_text": "ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates binding arbitration in San Diego County, California. The modified clause removes the 'binding' aspect and the specific location, effectively eliminating the consumer's right to a clearly defined and potentially more accessible dispute resolution process. California law has specific requirements for binding arbitration clauses to be enforceable, including clear disclosure and consent. By weakening this clause, the contract risks violating California's consumer protection laws regarding arbitration agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Arbitration Act (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. ยง 1280 et seq.) and California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Cal. Civ. Code ยง 1750 et seq.)",

                "changed_text": "PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT shall receive from THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION an accounting statement of Shared Revenues. The form and frequency of this statement shall be determined by THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear timeline (30 days after each quarter) and specifies that a 'detailed accounting statement' must be provided. The modified clause removes the 30 day period and replaces the obligation for a 'detailed' statement with something decided at the sole discretion of THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION. This is an omission that potentially violates basic contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing, and also could violate accounting standards enforced by law (Sarbanes-Oxley if the company is publicly traded). Furthermore, in California, this could be seen as an unfair business practice under Business and Professions Code Section 17200 if the accounting is misleading or prevents PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT from verifying revenues properly.",

PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT will pay any and all costs, damages, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs awarded against or otherwise incurred by Michael Henry, Melba Henry, THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION or any employees, representatives, agents and agent affiliates in connection with or arising from any such claim, suit, action or proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT will indemnify THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION against claims arising from PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT Content. THE HENRY FILM AND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION will provide notice of any such claim.",
                "explanation": "This significantly weakens the indemnification clause. The original includes a detailed list of covered parties and claims. It also stipulates requirements for notice, control of the defense, and settlement approval. The modified clause removes the specific requirement of prompt notice, and deletes the condition that PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT gets to control the defense of any action. California law generally implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, which includes providing adequate notice and opportunity to defend. By deleting those specific provisions, the indemnification obligation becomes vague and could violate California contract law by depriving PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT of the ability to effectively manage its risk and defend itself.",

However, should the Billing Party consider withholding payment or paying any such amount from payments due under this Agreement, the Billing Party shall send in advance to the other party a certificate setting forth the regulatory and/or legal framework for such a payment, including the provisions of the international tax treaty allowing such payment. The other party will have 30 days from the reception of such information to accept or refuse such payment/withholding:",

However, should the Billing Party consider withholding payment or paying any such amount from payments due under this Agreement, the Billing Party may notify the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a process where tax withholdings are justified with proper documentation and a 30-day window for the other party to contest it. The modified clause removes the requirements for regulatory justification and the 30-day acceptance window. By omitting these consumer rights the contract introduce legal risk. This violates tax regulations that require proper withholding documentation and processes.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'true and accurate' and deleting the details about the auditing process (2 year retention, independent firm, who bears cost of audit) the contract makes it hard for Non-Billing Party to verify financial reports, violating accounting laws that require verifiable records and audit trails.

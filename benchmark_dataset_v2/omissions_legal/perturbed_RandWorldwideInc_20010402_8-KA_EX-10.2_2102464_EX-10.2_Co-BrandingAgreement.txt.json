This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state. This Agreement shall not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the State of Delaware, The City of Wilmington for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to waive, and not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.",

                "explanation": "Removing the waiver of claims regarding inconvenient forum and improper venue undermines a party's right to raise these defenses, potentially violating principles of fair jurisdiction and due process, especially in consumer contracts where such waivers can be seen as coercive. Under New York law, while forum selection clauses are generally enforceable, they can be challenged if they are the result of fraud or overreaching, are unreasonable, or violate a strong public policy. Removing the explicit waiver of these challenges could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent consumer protection laws designed to ensure fairness in legal proceedings.",

                "changed_text": "11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial.",
                "explanation": "Completely removing the jury trial waiver infringes on the constitutional right to a jury trial, particularly concerning contracts that significantly impact consumers. Many jurisdictions require that waivers of jury trials be knowing and voluntary, and the complete removal of this clause could be seen as a violation of consumer rights, especially if it is not explicitly discussed or acknowledged during contract signing. Under New York law, while waivers are generally permitted, they must be clear, unambiguous, and knowingly made. Omission of any waiver language altogether may be deemed unenforceable, restoring the parties' right to a jury trial, but also creating uncertainty and potentially increased litigation costs for consumers unaware of their restored right.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that allows the non-assigning party to terminate the agreement within 30 days of receiving notice of assignment, the contract now allows assignment without recourse for the other party, significantly altering the balance of power. This omission introduces legal risk because it potentially violates implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the assignment negatively impacts the non-assigning party's rights or benefits under the contract. In New York, while contractual assignment is generally permitted, it cannot impair the rights or materially alter the obligations of the non-assigning party without their consent, either explicitly or implicitly granted in the agreement. Removing the termination right might be challenged as an unfair or unconscionable alteration of the contract terms, particularly if the assignment results in a less favorable outcome for the non-assigning party.",

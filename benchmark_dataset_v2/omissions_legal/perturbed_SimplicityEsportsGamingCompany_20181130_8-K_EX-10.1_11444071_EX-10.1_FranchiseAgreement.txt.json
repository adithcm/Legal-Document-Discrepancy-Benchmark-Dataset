                "original_text": "Franchisee shall ensure that the Smaaash Centres shall be set up, established, operated, managed, advertised, marketed, promoted, publicized and otherwise exploited, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in the Territory, including without limitation, all customs requirements and country of origin regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Franchisee shall ensure that the Smaaash Centres shall be set up, established, operated, managed, advertised, marketed, promoted, publicized and otherwise exploited, in accordance with the company's guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for the franchisee to comply with 'all applicable laws and regulations' and replaces it with compliance with 'company's guidelines'. This creates a legal risk as the company's guidelines might not be compliant with consumer protection laws, health and safety regulations, labor laws, accessibility laws (ADA) and other legal requirements in the Territory (North and South America).",
                "contradicted_law": "Various consumer protection, health and safety, labor, and accessibility laws specific to North and South American countries and their respective states/provinces.",

                "changed_text": "During the Term, Franchisee shall maintain policies of insurance as may be requested by Franchisor in relation to the Smaaash Centres.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'subject to applicable law' allows the Franchisor to potentially demand insurance policies that violate local law, such as requiring discriminatory coverage or excessively high coverage amounts that are unreasonable and contravene fair business practices. It can also make it more difficult for the franchisee to challenge unreasonable insurance demands.",
                "contradicted_law": "Various state and federal laws regarding fair business practices, non-discrimination in insurance coverage, and reasonable insurance requirements.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of any litigation or other action arising out of this Agreement, the court may award costs and expenses.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall award' to 'may award', the contract removes the guarantee that the prevailing party will receive reasonable attorney's fees. This creates a deterrent for the franchisee to pursue legitimate claims against the franchisor, as they now risk bearing substantial legal costs even if they win. This affects the franchisee's rights, potentially violating consumer protection laws that aim to ensure fair legal recourse. Some consumer protection laws mandate the recovery of attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiffs.",

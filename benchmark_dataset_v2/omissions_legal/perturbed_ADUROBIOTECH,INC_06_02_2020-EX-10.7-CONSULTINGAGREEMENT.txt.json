If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s).

                "explanation": "By removing section (c), the contract no longer explicitly requires the consultant to perform services in accordance with all Applicable Laws. This could create a legal risk because it removes a standard clause ensuring compliance with regulations relevant to the consulting services provided, potentially exposing Aduro to liability if the consultant violates laws during their work.",

In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",

In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.', the contract limits Aduro's remedies solely to injunctive relief. California law typically allows for a broader range of remedies in breach of contract cases. By limiting remedies, this clause could be seen as an attempt to circumvent the full extent of legal remedies available under California law, thereby increasing legal risk for Aduro if the limitation is deemed unenforceable or against public policy.",

This weakens Aduro's protection against potential insider trading violations by the consultant. While the consultant acknowledges the illegality of insider trading, the absence of a commitment to comply with Aduro's specific policy increases legal risk and the potential for regulatory scrutiny.",

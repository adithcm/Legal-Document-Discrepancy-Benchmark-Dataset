                "original_text": "15.1 The Terminal Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish and maintain, or cause to be furnished and maintained, in working order for the other Parties and for the Purchasers in TAT-14, for the duration of this Agreement, the necessary facilities in their respective Countries as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in TAT-14 assigned to such Parties or Purchasers for the purpose of handling communications transiting the Country involved. No Party shall be required under this Agreement to furnish such transit facilities in its Country to other Parties or Purchasers of its own Country.",
                "changed_text": "15.1 The Terminal Parties may furnish and maintain, or cause to be furnished and maintained, facilities in their respective Countries for the other Parties and for the Purchasers in TAT-14 for the duration of this Agreement. No Party shall be required under this Agreement to furnish such transit facilities in its Country to other Parties or Purchasers of its own Country.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall use all reasonable efforts to' to 'may' and removing 'necessary' and 'as may be reasonably required' significantly weakens the obligation of the Terminal Parties to provide and maintain transit facilities. This creates a legal risk because telecommunications regulations in many countries, including the USA, mandate that providers interconnect with other providers to ensure universal service. Removing the mandatory aspect and weakening the requirements contradicts those laws and could lead to regulatory penalties.",
                "contradicted_law": "Telecommunications Act of 1996 (USA), which emphasizes interconnection duties for telecommunications providers.",

The Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the appropriate consents, governmental authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to carry out their duties under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'should' and 'shall make all reasonable efforts' to 'may make efforts' weakens the obligation for parties to maintain necessary regulatory approvals and licenses. In many jurisdictions, including the USA and EU, operating as a telecommunications entity without proper licensing is illegal. This omission creates a legal risk because it removes the mandatory requirement to comply with these licensing laws.",

                "changed_text": "36.1 The construction, interpretation and performance of this Agreement may be governed by laws determined by the involved parties.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland' to 'may be governed by laws determined by the involved parties,' the contract now has no specific jurisdiction of governance which can cause legal issues. Typically, a contract would be interpreted under Swiss law, and any disputes would be subject to the Swiss legal system. However, with the change in language, the legal framework becomes uncertain. There is a legal risk as it will be difficult to enforce the agreement and introduces uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws apply, potentially conflicting with international law principles.",

                "original_text": "Each Party, at its own expense, and upon reasonable advance notice to the relevant Maintenance Authorities, shall have the right to inspect from time to time the operation and maintenance of any part of TAT-14 and to obtain copies of the maintenance records. For this purpose, each Maintenance Authority shall retain significant records, including recorder charts, for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date of the record. If these records are destroyed at the end of this period, a summary of important items shall be retained for the life of TAT-14.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party may inspect the operation and maintenance of TAT-14. Maintenance Authorities may retain records at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the legally required consumer right to inspect records, and the mandated retention period for maintenance records. By stating that authorities 'may' retain records 'at their discretion' eliminates the requirement to do so.",

The Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the appropriate consents, governmental authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to carry out their duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall endeavor to hold governmental and regulatory approvals.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the obligation to maintain necessary governmental and regulatory approvals. The original text states that parties 'shall' hold approvals, and 'shall make all reasonable efforts' to obtain necessary consents, while the modified version replaces that obligation with 'shall endeavor' to hold approvals which is not a guaranteed action to do so.",

Any Party may, without such approval, disclose such data and information to:\n\n(i)    the employees of that Party; or\n(ii)   the extent required by any applicable laws, or the requirement                 of any recognized stock exchange in compliance with its rules                 and  regulations or in the case if a party wholly owned by a                 sovereign government, by the rules of governance of the Party,                 or\n(iii)  any   government agency or regulatory authority lawfully                 requesting such information or to which such information needs                 to be submitted in order to obtain any necessary consent or                 approval', or\n(iv)   any Court of competent jurisdiction acting in pursuance of its                 powers; or\n(v)    professional advisors, auditors and bankers or any bona fide                 intending assignee upon obtaining a similar undertaking of                 confidentiality; or\n(vi)   the extent that such data and/or information is generally                 available to the public.",
                "changed_text": "Data and information acquired under this Agreement shall be confidential. Any Party may disclose such data and information to employees.",
                "explanation": "This change drastically limits the confidentiality obligations and removes critical exceptions for legally mandated disclosures to regulatory bodies, courts, and other entities. By eliminating the exceptions, the contract now potentially contradicts laws requiring disclosure in certain situations.",

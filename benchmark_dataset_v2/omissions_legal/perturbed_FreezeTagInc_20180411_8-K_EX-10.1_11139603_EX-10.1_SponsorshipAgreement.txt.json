                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best's rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days' notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days' notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",

The Association must be a named additional insured.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specific insurance amounts ($2,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate) and the requirements for advance notice of cancellation (30 days) or non-payment (10 days), the contract creates a loophole. While it mandates insurance, it fails to ensure sufficient coverage or notification, which are standard protections for additional insureds. This creates significant legal risk, as it leaves the Association vulnerable to under-insured claims and potential lapses in coverage without notice.",

The original text ensured diabetes was not a factor in employment decisions, so the new text opens the door to that possibility.",

In case no settlement can be reached through consultation within 30 days after one party ask for consultation, each party can submit such matter to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"CIETAC\") in accordance with its rules, and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Chinese and shall take place in Beijing. The arbitration award shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.",

In case no settlement can be reached through consultation, each party can submit such matter to a mutually agreed upon arbitration organization. The arbitration award shall be binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the specific designation of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) as the sole arbitration body and the requirement for arbitration to be conducted in Chinese in Beijing. Under PRC law, particularly the Arbitration Law of the People's Republic of China, parties have the right to choose their arbitration institution, but removing the initially agreed upon institution and not specifying another can create ambiguity and potentially violate requirements for clarity and fairness in dispute resolution. Furthermore, the deletion of the clause stating that the arbitration proceedings should be conducted in Chinese affects the right of the parties to agree in which language the process should be, affecting the process validity.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the stipulation that the laws of the People's Republic of China (PRC) govern the contract and replaces it with 'principles of international commerce'. This can violate PRC law, which requires contracts operating within its jurisdiction to adhere to its laws. Omitting the specific reference to PRC law creates ambiguity and could render the agreement unenforceable within China, especially concerning intellectual property rights, which are heavily regulated.",

                "changed_text": "Owner will endeavor to maintain insurance coverage for sudden and accidental pollution.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific $500,000,000 coverage amount and replacing 'covenants that it will maintain' with 'will endeavor to maintain', the contract weakens the legally required financial responsibility for pollution incidents. This creates a legal loophole and reduces the protection afforded to third parties who may be affected by pollution. Maritime law and environmental regulations often mandate specific minimum coverage levels to ensure adequate compensation for damages caused by pollution.",
                "contradicted_law": "Clean Water Act, Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), and related state regulations regarding financial responsibility for oil spills and pollution incidents. Although the specific amount is not dictated by federal law it is more specific than 'endeavor to maintain'.",

                "changed_text": "Owner will maintain a drug and alcohol abuse policy applicable to the vessels.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and enforce at all times during the Term of this Agreement' and 'which complies in all material respects with the minimum standards promulgated by the U.S. Coast Guard,' the contract weakens the commitment to a comprehensive and compliant drug and alcohol policy. The U.S. Coast Guard mandates specific standards for drug and alcohol testing and prevention programs on vessels. Removing this commitment introduces legal risk and reduces protection against potential liabilities arising from impaired crew members.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific language detailing 'good operating condition, properly manned, equipped and supplied for the voyage, to ensure that the pipes, pumps and coils tight, staunch, are in good operating condition and fit for the voyage, and to ensure that the tanks and other spaces in which product is to be carried are in good operating condition and fit for the carriage and preservation of the same' significantly weakens the obligation to ensure vessel safety and suitability for cargo. Also, removing 'at all times during the Term of this Agreement' and 'valid and subsisting' weakens the guarantee. Maritime law imposes strict requirements for vessel seaworthiness and proper maintenance. This omission creates a legal contradiction by reducing the level of diligence required and making the period less specific.",

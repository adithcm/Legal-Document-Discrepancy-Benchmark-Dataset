                "explanation": "By removing the word 'irrevocably', the waiver of jury trial becomes potentially revocable. This introduces a legal risk because, under Ontario law (specified in Section 12.06), waivers must be clear and unequivocal. Making the waiver revocable could render it unenforceable, contradicting the intention of the clause and potentially violating the standard of clear consent required for such waivers.",
                "contradicted_law": "The change affects the interpretation and enforceability of the waiver of jury trial under Ontario law, which requires clear and unequivocal waivers.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'to the extent the Licensed Products have been acquired from Grantee after the Effective Date and are used for the purpose for which they predominantly have been made (without modification or amendment)' has been removed. The intent of this phrase is to outline parameters in which the Grantor is not allowed to assert any claim for patent infringement. By removing that statement, the Grantor now has more freedom to assert claims of patent infringement, which may violate the implied warranty of non-infringement that is generally included in software license agreements.",

Under Ontario law, there are some statutory causes of action where consequential damages cannot be waived. This also goes against the reasonable expectation of both Parties involved. ",

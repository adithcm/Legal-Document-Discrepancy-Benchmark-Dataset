The parties agree that any disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration, waiving any right to pursue claims in court.",
                "explanation": "By adding a clause mandating binding arbitration and waiving the right to pursue claims in court, this modification could potentially violate consumer protection laws in certain jurisdictions (including some provinces/territories in Canada) that ensure consumers have access to court systems, especially for smaller claims or those involving significant power imbalances. Some Canadian provinces have legislation that restricts or voids mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. By forcing arbitration and removing court access, a consumer's legal rights are diminished and introduces a legal contradiction.",

The original clause provided a legally sound exception for mandatory disclosures. Removing it, now forces a party to potentially violate laws related to securities disclosures or other mandatory reporting obligations, to maintain confidentiality. This is a legal contradiction.",

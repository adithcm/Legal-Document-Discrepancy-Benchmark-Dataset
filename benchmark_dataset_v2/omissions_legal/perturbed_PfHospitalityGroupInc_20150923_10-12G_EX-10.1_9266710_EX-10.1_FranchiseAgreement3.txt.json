                "type": "Omissions - Omission Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement may cause Franchisor injury.",
                "explanation": "This removes the guarantee that the member will pay all court costs and attorney's fees incurred by the Franchisor. While the Franchisor may still be able to pursue these costs, removing the guarantee puts the burden on the Franchisor, weakening the clause, and potentially violating implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing present in most US jurisdictions.",

                "original_text": "All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable. If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor's and/or Franchisee's legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid.",
                "changed_text": "All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable. If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the parties will renegotiate in good faith.",
                "explanation": "This removes the specific instruction to the court to reform and modify the provision to protect the Franchisor's/Franchisee's business needs and removes the clause that the reformed provision be imposed retroactively. By only requiring renegotiation, the contract fails to adequately protect the Franchisor/Franchisee against invalid provisions, potentially violating implied covenants and creating uncertainty. In some jurisdictions, retroactive application may be limited, but the original text is preferable to the modified text.",

                "changed_text": "Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that Franchisor may be considered a beneficiary of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit statement that the Franchisor is a third-party beneficiary *with the right to enforce* the agreement, the contract introduces ambiguity and legal risk. This weakens the Franchisor's position, making it potentially more difficult for them to enforce the agreement against the Member. This can violate the implied duty of good faith if it undermines the Franchisor's intended benefits from the agreement.",

All authorized returns will be shipped by Distributor freight prepaid. Unauthorized returns may be reshipped to Distributor, freight collect.\n\n9.2 Distributor may request stock rotation return of slow moving Products, which will be authorized by Tripath provided that: (a) the Product is contained in Tripath's then current Distributor Price List, (b) the Product is packaged as it was originally shipped, and (c) a purchase order for equal value accompanies the request for return. Such stock rotation returns will not exceed five percent (5%) of the dollar value of Distributor's previous six (6) months net purchase orders from Tripath.\n\n9.3 Discontinued Product may be returned only with prior written authorization.\n\n9.4 Credit will be allowed for returned Products based on the price actually paid by Distributor, less any prior DPAs, credits and other allowances.\n\n9.5 If, in the reasonable opinion of Tripath, previously authorized returned Products have been used or damaged, a credit or replacement may be refused. Distributor will be notified within one month after receipt of Product by Tripath of any such Product Tripath is claiming to be used or damaged.",

Any Product replaced will become Tripath property.\n\n10.4 Distributor must return the defective OEM Product pursuant to a return material authorization under Section 9.1 in the original shipping carton (or an equivalent protective carton), and pay the shipping and insurance charges. Distributor assumes the risk of loss or damage during shipment.\n\n10.5 OEM Products that are defective as set forth in Section 10.2 as a result of improper handling, incorrect installation or other misuse, or as a result of accident, disaster, acts of God or other such events, as determined by Tripath in its reasonable discretion, are not covered by this limited warranty.\n\n10.6 For OEM Products, Tripath provides only the warranties set forth in this limited one year limited warranty.

                "explanation": "The weakening of the warranty language, especially regarding the time period and the removal of options for the remedy for defects (like refunding the purchase price), significantly reduces consumer protection.

Distributor agrees that Tripath has the right to, and Tripath agrees that it will at its expense, defend or at its option settle any claim, suit, proceeding, or other action brought against Distributor or its customer for infringement of any United States copyright, trademark or other United States intellectual property right related to the Products or their use, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section. Tripath will have sole control of any such action or settlement negotiations (Tripath will not be liable for any costs or expenses incurred without its prior written authorization), and Tripath will pay any final judgment entered against Distributor or its customer based on such infringement. Tripath at its sole option will be relieved of the foregoing obligations unless Distributor or its customer notifies Tripath promptly in writing of such action and gives Tripath full information and assistance to settle and/or defend any such action. If it is adjudicated that a Product infringes, or if the sale or use of a Product is, as a result, enjoined, then Tripath will, at its option and expense either: (i) procure for Distributor and its customers the right to sell or use the Product; or (ii) replace the Product with other suitable Product; or (iii) suitably modify the Product to be noninfringing; or (iv) if none of the foregoing are commercially reasonable, as determined by Tripath, accept return of the affected Products and refund Distributor's aggregate payments for such Products, less a reasonable sum for use and/or damage, if any.\n\n19.2 Limitation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19.1, Tripath assumes no liability for, and Distributor agrees to indemnify Tripath to the same extent as Tripath's indemnity under Section 19.1 for: (i) any infringements covering completed equipment or any assembly, circuit, combination, or method in which any of the Products may be used but not covering such Products standing alone; or (ii) any trademark infringements involving any marking or branding not applied by Tripath or involving any marking or branding applied at the request of Distributor; or (iii) any modification of the Products unless such modification was made by Tripath.\n\n19.3 Entire Liability. The foregoing provisions of this section 19 state the entire liability and obligations of Tripath and the exclusive remedy of Distributor and its customers, with respect to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement by the Products.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'at its expense' from Tripath's obligation to defend IP claims and limiting the options when a product infringes, the contract shifts more financial burden onto the distributor. Further, removing 'accept return of the affected Products and refund Distributor's aggregate payments for such Products, less a reasonable sum for use and/or damage, if any' eliminates a key financial remedy for the distributor. Removing 'assumes no liability' is small and might be overlooked, but it reduces Distributor protections. This could be seen as violating the duty of good faith, especially if Tripath knew of potential infringement issues. This could be seen as a form of fraud.",

Each Party agrees to refrain from, either during period of this Agreement or at any other time thereafter, disclosing, using or disseminating such confidential information, for its or another's benefit, in any way acquired in the course of any association arising out of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"at any other time thereafter\" weakens the confidentiality clause by implying it may not extend beyond the agreement's duration. This contradicts the intent of trade secret law, which in Pennsylvania (governing law per section 8), protects trade secrets even after termination of an agreement if the information remains confidential and provides a competitive advantage. Omitting this key provision creates legal risk as it suggests confidentiality obligations might lapse prematurely, potentially jeopardizing trade secret protection under Pennsylvania law.",

Venue for any action brought under this Agreement shall be in the appropriate court in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that the contract is governed by Pennsylvania law, including all matters of construction, validity, performance, and enforcement and \"without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws\". Removing the phrase \"without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws\" could be problematic because conflict of law principles are designed to determine which jurisdiction's laws should apply when there are conflicts between different states or countries. Deleting this phrase introduces ambiguity and could potentially allow a court to apply the laws of a jurisdiction other than Pennsylvania if conflict of laws principles suggest it. This goes against the initial intent of the clause to be governed solely by Pennsylvania law. Pennsylvania courts adhere to conflict of laws principles. This change creates legal uncertainty and the potential for the application of laws less favorable to one or more parties, introducing legal risk, and potentially violating basic principles of contract interpretation under Pennsylvania law.",

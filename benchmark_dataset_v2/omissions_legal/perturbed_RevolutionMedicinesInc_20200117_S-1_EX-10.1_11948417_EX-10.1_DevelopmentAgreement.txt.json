Such records shall fully and properly reflect all work done and results achieved in the performance of the Research activities in good scientific manner appropriate for regulatory and patent purposes.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party shall maintain records of all Research activities conducted by it hereunder, and all data and other information resulting from such activities.",
                "explanation": "Removing the requirements that records be 'complete, current, and accurate' and that they 'fully and properly reflect all work done and results achieved in the performance of the Research activities in good scientific manner appropriate for regulatory and patent purposes' significantly weakens the record-keeping obligation. This omission violates FDA regulations and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) which mandate specific standards for data integrity, accuracy, and reliability in research activities.",

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, RevMed shall use diligent efforts to conduct its activities under each Development Plan in accordance with the terms of such Development Plan (including timelines), as the same may be amended from time to time (and which basis for comparison shall be tolled until any then-contemplated or pending amendments are completed or for the duration of any bona fide dispute between the Parties with respect to a Development Plan or amendment thereto), and this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The removed text initially mandates compliance with 'all Applicable Law (including GMP, GLP and GCP)' for Development activities. GMP, GLP, and GCP are legal and regulatory standards for product quality and safety. Eliminating this legal compliance mandate introduces a **legal contradiction** with requirements set by regulatory bodies like the FDA. This change makes the contract potentially non-compliant.",

GCP, GLP, and GMP are legal and regulatory standards for product quality and safety. Eliminating this legal compliance mandate introduces a **legal contradiction** with requirements set by regulatory bodies like the FDA. Also the removal of the right to obtain access to the original to the extent necessary for regulatory and patent purposes or for other legal proceedings, reduces the ability to ensure compliance and protect Intellectual property.

Berkshire shall indemnify and hold Auriemma harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees) (collectively, \"Claims\") arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy or breach of Berkshire's representations, warranties, covenants or any claim or other cause of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including actions based upon gross negligence of Berkshire under this Agreement, provided that Berkshire shall be given prompt notice of any such action or claim.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees)\", the contract now is omitting a crucial component of indemnification, potentially violating Connecticut law regarding full and fair compensation for damages. Connecticut law mandates that indemnification clauses should be construed broadly to cover all losses suffered, and this clause restricts that broad interpretation.",

Any dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of three qualified arbitrators. Berkshire and Auriemma shall each choose an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall choose the third. If either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma fails to choose an arbitrator within 30 days after notice of commencement of arbitration or if the two arbitrators fail to choose a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after their appointment, the American Arbitration Association shall, upon the request of any party to the dispute or difference, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators to constitute or complete the panel as the case may be. Arbitration proceedings hereunder may be initiated by either BERKSHIRE or Auriemma making a written request to the American Arbitration Association, together with any appropriate filing fee, at the office of the American Arbitration Association in the county in which proceedings are to be held pursuant to the terms of the following sentence. All arbitration proceedings or litigation (to the extent the remedy requested is not, by law, available through arbitration [e.g., injunctive relief]) relating to any claims or disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the county in which the principal executive office of the party not initiating such action or proceeding defendant or responding party) is located. The parties irrevocably submit and consent to the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over each of the parties by the federal and/or state courts in such jurisdiction (the \"Selected Jurisdiction\"). The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and all objections that any party",

Any dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration by a single arbitrator selected solely by Berkshire Bank.

All arbitration proceedings or litigation relating to any claims or disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in a location solely determined by Berkshire. The parties submit and consent to the jurisdiction over each of the parties.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for a panel of three arbitrators and gives Berkshire sole control over the selection of the arbitrator and the arbitration location. This significantly disadvantages Auriemma and likely violates principles of fairness and impartiality in arbitration, contradicting Connecticut's Uniform Arbitration Act, which implies a need for a neutral selection process.",

                "explanation": "By stating termination rights are the 'exclusive remedy' and will 'prejudice all rights' the contract eliminates the ability for either party to pursue additional legal avenues for breach or damages. And by stating that neither party shall claim arbitration or litigation, the contract violates the right to seek redress for grievances, which is a fundamental legal right, which could conflict with Connecticut law regarding contract remedies and access to courts.",

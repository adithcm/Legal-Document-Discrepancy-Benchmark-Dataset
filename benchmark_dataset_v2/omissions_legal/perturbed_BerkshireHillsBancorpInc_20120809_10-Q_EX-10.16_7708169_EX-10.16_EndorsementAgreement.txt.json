                "original_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",
                "changed_text": "Past due cash payments shall accrue interest at a rate determined by Berkshire.",
                "explanation": "By removing the fixed interest rate and replacing it with a rate determined by Berkshire, the contract omits a clear and predetermined interest rate for late payments. This introduces uncertainty and could potentially violate usury laws or regulations requiring transparency in interest rate charges.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of usury laws and regulations requiring transparency in interest rate charges.  Potentially Massachusetts law regarding interest on late payments if applicable.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of any arbitration or litigation, including breach, enforcement or interpretation, arising out of this Agreement, each party shall bear its own attorney's fees, costs, and expenses.",
                "explanation": "By stating that each party shall bear its own legal costs, it removes the right of the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees. Some states have laws that mandate the recovery of attorney's fees in certain contract disputes, especially those involving consumer protection. Eliminating this clause creates a potential legal risk if such laws apply.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase '(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees)', the contract now limits the scope of indemnification. Some state laws require that indemnification clauses explicitly include attorney's fees and other related costs to be enforceable. By omitting this, the contract risks being interpreted as not covering these essential expenses, potentially violating the implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing inherent in contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state laws and principles of contract law that require explicit inclusion of attorney's fees in indemnification clauses to be fully enforceable, and implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing.",

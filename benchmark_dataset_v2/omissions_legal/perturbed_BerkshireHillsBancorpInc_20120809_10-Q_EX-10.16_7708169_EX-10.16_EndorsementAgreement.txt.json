                "changed_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the  applicable invoice) may, at Berkshire's discretion, bear interest.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guaranteed interest on late payments, the contract now contradicts the consumer protection laws regarding late payment fees and interest accrual. Massachusetts law regulates the interest rates and late fees that can be charged, requiring clear and consistent application, which this modification undermines.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates the prevailing party's right to recover attorney's fees. While seemingly neutral, this can deter individuals from pursuing legitimate claims, especially if the potential recovery is less than the cost of litigation. This could violate implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, as it creates a significant power imbalance and contradicts the principles of ensuring access to justice.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law clause to allow Berkshire to choose the jurisdiction at its sole discretion undermines consumer protection. It potentially allows Berkshire to select a jurisdiction with laws less favorable to the consumer, potentially violating consumer protection laws that aim to ensure fair legal recourse and protection.",

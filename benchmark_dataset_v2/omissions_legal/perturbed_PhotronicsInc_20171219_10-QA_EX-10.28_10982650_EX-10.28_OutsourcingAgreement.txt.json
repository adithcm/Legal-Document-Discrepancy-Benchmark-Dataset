This warranty does not apply to any Product failures resulting from misuse, storage in or exposure to environmental conditions inconsistent with those specified in the applicable specifications or documentation, modification of the Product by anyone other than the relevant Supplier. If a Product fails to comply with the foregoing warranty, the relevant Supplier shall, at its option, either [***]such Product, or, in the event the foregoing options are not commercially practicable, [***]to the Company any amounts paid for the applicable Product. Without limiting the remedies specified in Article 8 and Section 9.2, this Section 6.1 states the exclusive remedy of the Company for failure of a Product to conform to the warranty provisions set forth in this Section 6.1.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific exceptions to the warranty (failures resulting from misuse, improper storage, or unauthorized modification), the warranty clause becomes overly broad and potentially unenforceable. This omission could violate consumer protection laws in Connecticut (where Photronics is based) and other jurisdictions by failing to provide clear and reasonable limitations on the warranty. The removal of specifics of the warranty makes it ambiguous.",

By eliminating this clear timeframe, the contract becomes vague and could allow for delayed payments without penalty.

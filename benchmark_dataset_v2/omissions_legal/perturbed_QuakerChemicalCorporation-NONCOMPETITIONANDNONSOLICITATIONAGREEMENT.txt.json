Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the 'provided, however' clause, which contains exceptions to the non-compete agreement. Removing these exceptions broadens the scope of the non-compete agreement and may make it unreasonably restrictive under Pennsylvania law, which requires non-compete agreements to be reasonably limited in scope and duration to protect legitimate business interests. By eliminating the permitted activities, the agreement risks being deemed unenforceable due to overbreadth.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former",

                "explanation": "By removing the exception that allows Sellers to solicit former employees terminated by the Buyer or the Company after six months and to solicit employees through general public solicitations, the non-solicitation clause becomes overly broad. Pennsylvania courts scrutinize non-solicitation agreements to ensure they are reasonably tailored to protect legitimate business interests without unduly restricting individual employment opportunities. Eliminating these exceptions could render the clause unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade.",

To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that best gives them effect.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that limits enforcement to the extent permitted by applicable law and calls for construction that best gives effect to the covenants removes a critical safeguard. This clause ensures that the non-compete and non-solicitation provisions are interpreted and enforced reasonably, in accordance with legal principles. Without this clause, a court might enforce an overly broad restriction, violating public policy against unreasonable restraints of trade.",

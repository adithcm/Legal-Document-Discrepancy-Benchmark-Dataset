                "changed_text": "XSPA shall operate and maintain the Stores with standards of quality and service.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to comply with all applicable laws, this clause introduces a significant legal risk. Businesses are legally obligated to adhere to various federal, state, and local laws related to operations, safety, and consumer protection. Omitting this obligation makes the contract non-compliant and exposes XSPA to potential legal liabilities.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the previous omission, removing the requirement for XSPA's ACDBE Partners to comply with all applicable laws introduces legal risk. ACDBE partners are still bound by law, and XSPA remains liable for their actions. This omission does not absolve them of their legal obligations but removes a contractual commitment to compliance, weakening XSPA's position.",

The certificates shall provide that Calm will be given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation or any material change in these policies.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to the foregoing, XSPA may provide to Calm certificate(s) evidencing such insurance prior to or upon execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Mandatory provision of insurance certificates (and 30 days notice) provides Calm with assurance that XSPA maintains the required insurance coverage, a crucial element for risk management. By making it optional, it weakens Calm's protection. Without certificates, Calm cannot independently verify XSPA's compliance with insurance requirements. Many states mandate that businesses operating in certain sectors maintain specific insurance types and coverage levels. By removing that requirement, it could open up the business to significant legal liability if there is an insurable event and they do not have insurance or enough coverage.",

                "original_text": "XSPA shall obtain, and thereafter maintain during the Term, the following insurance: (a) Special form property policy covering all stock on premises of the Store, including with respect to all Product Collateral; (b) Workers' Compensation Insurance in the statutorily required amount (or XSPA shall participate in the appropriate state fund if such insurance is not available or allowed), together with Employer's Liability Insurance with a limit of $1,000,000 for each accident; and (c) Commercial General Liability insurance, (including fire liability, contractual liability, personal injury, product liability and completed operations coverage) in the amount of not less than $3,000,000 combined single limit with umbrella liability coverage with a limit of not less than $10,000,000; The foregoing insurance policies shall name XSPA as the insured and Calm as additional insured (except for Workers' Compensation Insurance). If any such insurance is on a \"claims made\" basis, XSPA shall maintain coverage thereunder for a period of at least two (2) years following the termination of this Agreement. With respect to the foregoing, XSPA shall provide to Calm certificate(s) evidencing such insurance prior to or upon execution of this Agreement. The certificates shall provide that Calm will be given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation or any material change in these policies. Calm shall have no obligation to XSPA for the costs of insurance required, or for any other coverage that XSPA obtains, directly or indirectly for its own account. In no event shall any insurer have a Best's Insurance rating of less than (A-) of class size VII.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes the mandatory 'statutorily required amount' for Worker's Compensation, the 'Employer's Liability Insurance', the coverage amounts for Commercial General Liability and Umbrella Liability, the 'additional insured' clause naming Calm, the 'claims made' basis coverage continuation, the insurance certificate provision, the 30-day cancellation notice, and the Best's Insurance rating requirement. This weakens XSPA's insurance obligations and increases Calm's risk. Worker's compensation is legally mandated in most states, as are specific liability coverage levels for businesses. Removing these requirements introduces potential legal challenges and liabilities.",

XSPA's representatives may, from time to time during regular business hours on reasonable advance notice, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, inspect and audit such books and records and examine and copy all other documents and material in the possession or under the control of Calm with respect to the subject matter and the terms of this Agreement. After completion of any inspection or audit pursuant to this Section 8.02, XSPA shall notify Calm of the results of such inspection and audit (the \"Calm Audit Results\"). Upon receipt of such information, Calm shall have thirty (30) days (the \"Calm Review Period\") to review the Calm Audit Results. On or prior to the last day of the Calm Review Period, Calm may object to the Calm Audit Results by delivering to XSPA a written statement setting forth its objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for its disagreement therewith (the \"Calm Statement of Objections\"). If Calm fails to deliver the Calm Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Calm Review Period, the Calm Audit Results shall be deemed to have been accepted by Calm. If Calm delivers the Calm Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Calm Review Period, Calm and XSPA shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Calm Statement of Objections (the \"Calm Resolution Period\"), and, if the same are so resolved within the Calm Resolution Period, the Calm Audit Results with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Calm and XSPA, shall be final and binding. If Calm and XSPA fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Calm Statement of Objections before expiration of the Calm Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute (\"Calm Disputed Amounts\" and any amounts not so disputed, the \"Calm Undisputed Amounts\") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants mutually agreeable to Calm and XSPA (each acting reasonably and in good faith) (the \"Independent Accountant\") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Calm Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Calm Audit Results. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision for each Calm Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Calm Audit Results and the Calm Statement of Objections, respectively.",

Removing the 'complete and accurate' clause creates a loophole where Calm can maintain incomplete records.

                "explanation": "This change omits the legally mandated FDIC insurance coverage limits, suggesting that insurance is discretionary and based on company policy. This contradicts the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which guarantees deposit insurance up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase 'certified by independent public accountants in accordance with Regulation S-X under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act' weakens investor protection and could violate SEC rules regarding financial reporting for publicly traded companies. Certified reports ensure accuracy and are legally required.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the statement by removing the language ensuring compliance or exemption from *all* requirements, and removes specifics, introducing ambiguity and potentially violating consumer protection laws like the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).

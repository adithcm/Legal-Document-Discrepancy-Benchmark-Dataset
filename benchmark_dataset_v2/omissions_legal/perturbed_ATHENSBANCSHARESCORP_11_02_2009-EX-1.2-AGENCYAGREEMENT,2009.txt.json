                "changed_text": "The deposit accounts of the Bank may be insured based on company policy, and the Company and the Bank will try to make the best effort to keep the deposit insured. The company can't ensure that proceedings for the termination or revocation of such insurance will not happen in the future.",
                "explanation": "Federal law mandates FDIC insurance coverage for bank deposits up to certain limits. Removing the explicit guarantee and replacing it with a vague statement about 'company policy' and efforts violates consumer protection laws regarding deposit insurance disclosure. It also introduces ambiguity regarding the extent and reliability of deposit insurance.",

By stating that the Company may or may not maintain the effectiveness of such registration means they may deregister at any moment making it non-compliant with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

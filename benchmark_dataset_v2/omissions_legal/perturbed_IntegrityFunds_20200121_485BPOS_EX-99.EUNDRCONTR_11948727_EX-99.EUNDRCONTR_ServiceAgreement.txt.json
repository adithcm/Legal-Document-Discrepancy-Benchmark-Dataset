Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirement for Integrity to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, especially those of the SEC and registered securities associations, the agreement creates a loophole. While general legal compliance might be implied, the omission of this explicit statement weakens consumer protections, particularly regarding suitability requirements, fair dealing, and disclosure obligations imposed on underwriters. This introduces a legal risk because it suggests a reduced commitment to adhering to mandatory securities laws designed to protect investors.",

The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 'provided, however' clauses that limit the Fund's indemnification of Integrity, the agreement now implies that the Fund will indemnify Integrity even for liabilities arising from Integrity's own misconduct (willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of obligations). This contradicts established legal principles that prevent indemnification for one's own intentional or grossly negligent acts, violating the duty of care owed to investors by the Fund's trustees. It creates a legal risk because it potentially allows Integrity to be shielded from liability for actions that harm investors.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'without penalty' implies that the Fund might incur a penalty for terminating the agreement, even if done according to the specified conditions. This directly contradicts the requirement in the Investment Company Act of 1940 that such agreements be terminable 'without penalty' to protect the fund and its shareholders' interests. This is a significant issue as it might deter the trustees from terminating a poorly performing or mismanaged underwriter due to the threat of incurring a penalty, thereby harming investors.",

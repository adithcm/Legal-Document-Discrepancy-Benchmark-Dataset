                "original_text": "Each of the Village Media Company and PFHOF, as applicable, agrees to be in material compliance with all federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations applicable to its respective operations and to obtain and maintain all licenses and permits required by law necessary for each of their respective operations.",
                "changed_text": "Each of the Village Media Company and PFHOF, as applicable, agrees to be in compliance with all company policies applicable to its respective operations and to obtain and maintain all licenses and permits required by company policy necessary for each of their respective operations.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the legal requirement for compliance with federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, replacing it with compliance to only company policies. This omission introduces a legal risk as the company can now operate without adhering to mandatory legal standards, thereby creating a legal loophole that potentially violates numerous consumer protection and regulatory laws.",

The arbitration shall be held in Canton, Ohio, and shall be before a panel of three arbitrators, one chosen by each of the Parties and a third chosen by the two arbitrators so chosen by the Parties. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the arbitration, each Party shall submit to the other the documents and a list of witnesses it intends to interview or call in the arbitration. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive law of the State of Ohio with regard to any dispute that becomes the subject of arbitration, and the arbitrators will be so instructed. The arbitrators shall issue a written opinion stating the findings of fact and the conclusions of law upon which the decision is based. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute between the Parties concerning the scope or interpretation of this Agreement shall be submitted to non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be held in Canton, Ohio. The Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute amicably.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the binding arbitration clause and replaces it with non-binding mediation. This weakens the enforcement mechanism for the agreement. By changing 'binding arbitration' to 'non-binding mediation,' the contract eliminates a guaranteed resolution pathway. Ohio law favors arbitration, and its removal increases the risk of protracted legal battles and weakens consumer rights by making dispute resolution less definitive.",

                "changed_text": "In any action, suit, proceeding, claim, or counterclaim brought to enforce this Agreement or any of its provisions, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the provision for the prevailing party to recover costs, fees, and expenses. This is a significant omission because it discourages legal challenges, especially for smaller entities or individuals who may be less able to afford legal costs. Under Ohio law, the ability to recover costs and attorney's fees can be a critical factor in deciding whether to pursue legal action, thus omission deters consumers. This contradicts the principle of making parties whole.",

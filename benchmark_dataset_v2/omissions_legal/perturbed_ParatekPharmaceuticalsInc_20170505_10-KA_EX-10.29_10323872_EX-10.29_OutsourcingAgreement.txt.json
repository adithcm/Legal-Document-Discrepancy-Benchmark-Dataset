                "explanation": "This change weakens the supplier's obligation to comply with all applicable laws. It introduces a lower standard of 'reasonable efforts', which may not be sufficient to meet legal requirements in pharmaceutical manufacturing, potentially violating GMP regulations and other applicable laws. Applicable Law means any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, order, judgment or ordinance of any governmental or regulatory authority or agency.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'Applicable Law and cGMP Requirements', the contract no longer explicitly requires the product to be manufactured, stored, and shipped in accordance with these critical standards. This creates a legal loophole that could expose the customer to risks associated with non-compliant products, violating manufacturing and safety regulations.",

                "changed_text": "Customer and Supplier each represent that they have some insurance coverage against liability arising under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the insurance requirements for the supplier. Removing the specific insurance amount [* * *] and replacing 'sufficiently insured' with 'some insurance coverage' allows the supplier to have minimal coverage, potentially inadequate to cover liabilities under the agreement. This introduces a risk of non-compliance with insurance regulations related to pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution, potentially shifting significant financial risk onto the customer.",

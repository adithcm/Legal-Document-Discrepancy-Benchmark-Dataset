(ii) Employer's Liability Insurance in the minimum required. (iii) General Liability Insurance. (iv) Automobile Liability insurance (v) a crime policy.",
                "explanation": "The removal of specific coverage amounts and definitions of 'comprehensive' weaken the insurance requirements. This introduces significant legal risk, as Georgia law mandates specific minimum coverage amounts for worker's compensation, employer's liability insurance, general liability insurance, and automobile liability insurance, depending on the nature of the business and the risks involved.  Simply stating \"minimum required\" or \"General Liability Insurance\" is insufficient and leaves the contract non-compliant.",

Each policy of insurance which Schoolpop is required to possess under this Agreement shall name AEIS, and its Directors, Officers, and Employees, as additional insured in the insurance policy limits herein required. In the event that any service under this Agreement is to be rendered by persons other than Schoolpop's employees, Schoolpop shall furnish AEIS with evidence of insurance for such persons subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth above and applicable to Schoolpop prior to commencement of service by such person(s).",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for AEIS to receive 30 days' advance written notice of cancellation or material changes to the insurance policy eliminates a critical protection for AEIS. Also, the omission of 'Each policy of insurance which Schoolpop is required to possess under this Agreement shall name AEIS, and its Directors, Officers, and Employees, as additional insured in the insurance policy limits herein required.' significantly reduces the protection provided to AEIS, its directors, officers, and employees. Georgia law generally requires that parties named as additional insureds under a policy are entitled to the same protections and coverage as the primary insured, up to the policy limits.  By omitting this requirement, AEIS exposes itself to potential liability without the assurance of insurance coverage.",

                "explanation": "The removal of clear payment methods and timelines introduces ambiguity and creates a legal risk. While it does not explicitly violate a single statute, the lack of defined payment terms can be construed as unfair and deceptive practice, especially if AEIS unilaterally changes payment requirements without agreement.

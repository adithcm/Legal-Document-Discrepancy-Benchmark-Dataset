                "original_text": "SIERRA warrants that it carries general liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $5 million per occurrence and that, upon the execution of this Agreement, it will name ENVISION as an additional insured on such policies. SIERRA further warrants that the Product will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law. SIERRA agrees to promptly notify ENVISION of any problem, anomaly, defect or condition which would reasonably cause ENVISION's concern relative to stability, reliability, form, fit, function or quality of the Product.",
                "changed_text": "SIERRA warrants that it carries general liability insurance and product liability insurance and that, upon the execution of this Agreement, it may name ENVISION as an additional insured on such policies. SIERRA agrees to notify ENVISION of any significant problem, anomaly, or defect related to the quality of the Product if SIERRA deems such notification necessary.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific insurance coverage amounts ($2 million and $5 million) weakens the protection for ENVISION and creates a potential contradiction with state laws that might require specific minimum coverage for product liability, especially in Colorado where the agreement is deemed to be entered into. The modification of the adulteration/misbranding warranty removes a key consumer protection element required by federal and state laws related to product safety and labeling. Changing 'promptly notify' to 'notify if SIERRA deems necessary' introduces ambiguity and undermines ENVISION's ability to take swift action on product quality concerns, potentially violating consumer protection regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state-specific product liability insurance requirements and federal/state laws regarding adulteration and misbranding (e.g., the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) as well as consumer protection regulations in Colorado.",

In the event of any breach of this warranty or in the event any user of the Finished Product makes a claim that the Finished Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), ENVISION shall indemnify, defend, and hold SIERRA harmless from any liability occasioned by a breach of warranty or a product liability claim. ENVISION warrants that it carries general liability insurance of $1 million per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence and that, upon execution of this Agreement, it will name SIERRA as an additional insured on such policies.",

In the event any user of the Finished Product makes a claim that the Finished Product was the cause of personal injury or property damage (product liability claim), ENVISION shall make reasonable efforts to indemnify, defend, and hold SIERRA harmless from any liability. ENVISION warrants that it carries general liability insurance and product liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'knowingly' significantly weakens the warranty against adulteration/misbranding, potentially violating food safety laws. Changing 'shall indemnify, defend, and hold SIERRA harmless' to 'shall make reasonable efforts to indemnify, defend, and hold SIERRA harmless' reduces the legal obligation of ENVISION. Removing specific insurance coverage amounts and the requirement to name SIERRA as an additional insured reduces SIERRA's protection and may conflict with state laws requiring minimum insurance levels for product liability.",

                "explanation": "Removing the condition of 'at least ninety (90) days advance notice in writing and in good faith by conference of the parties' before changing prices allows SIERRA to change prices arbitrarily, potentially violating good faith dealing requirements implied in contract law and potentially conflicting with consumer protection principles related to fair pricing practices.",

                "original_text": "SIERRA warrants that it carries general liability insurance of not less than $2 million per occurrence and product liability insurance of not less than $5 million per occurrence and that, upon the execution of this Agreement, it will name ENVISION as an additional insured on such policies.",
                "changed_text": "SIERRA warrants that it carries general liability insurance and product liability insurance and that, upon the execution of this Agreement, it may name ENVISION as an additional insured on such policies.",
                "explanation": "Removing the minimum insurance coverage amounts and making the additional insured status optional weakens ENVISION's protection. Colorado law often implies minimum insurance standards in distribution agreements to ensure adequate compensation for potential liabilities; the modification potentially violates these standards by allowing SIERRA to carry minimal or no effective coverage. Additionally, the law requires specificity in contracts, and 'general liability insurance' is considered vague, creating a potential legal loophole.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'within the meaning of any federal, state, or local law or regulation or other applicable law' weakens the warranty against adulteration and misbranding. US federal law (like the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) defines these terms, and omitting the reference to these laws creates ambiguity and potential non-compliance. Consumers in Colorado have a right to assume products meet legal standards.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific coverage amounts and the mandatory nature of naming SIERRA as an additional insured weakens SIERRA's protection against potential liabilities stemming from ENVISION's distribution of the finished product. Colorado law favors clear contractual terms and implied minimum standards, and this modification allows ENVISION to maintain inadequate or nonexistent insurance coverage, creating a potential legal loophole and potentially violating these standards.",

AT THE OPTION OF THE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY FEDERAL COURT OR MINNESOTA STATE COURT SITTING IN HENNEPIN COUNTY OR\n\n5\n\nRAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA; AND THE INVESTOR, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH COURT AND WAIVE ANY ARGUMENT THAT VENUE IN SUCH FORUMS IS NOT CONVENIENT. IN THE EVENT ANY BORROWER OR THE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, COMMENCES ANY ACTION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR VENUE UNDER ANY TORT OR CONTRACT THEORY ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER PARTY AT ITS OPTION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO HAVE THE CASE TRANSFERRED TO ONE OF THE JURISDICTIONS AND VENUES ABOVE-DESCRIBED, OR IF SUCH TRANSFER CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TO HAVE SUCH CASE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.",

THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT, AND THE INVESTOR, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH COURT. IN THE EVENT ANY BORROWER OR THE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, COMMENCES ANY ACTION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR VENUE UNDER ANY TORT OR CONTRACT THEORY ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO HAVE THE CASE ADJUDICATED AS DETERMINED BY THE COURT.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the agreement may be enforced in Minnesota state or federal court. By removing this specification, the agreement loses the certainty of venue, which could violate laws ensuring predictability and fairness in legal proceedings, especially for smaller entities that might face significant hardship litigating in distant or unfavorable jurisdictions. The changes eliminates the borrower's explicit right to transfer the case to a Minnesota court, creating ambiguity and disadvantaging them. Further, omitting the clause 'OR IF SUCH TRANSFER CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TO HAVE SUCH CASE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.' eliminates the right to case dismissal.",

The modified clause only states that the Investor waives this right. This creates an imbalance in the agreement, suggesting the Agent and Lenders retain the right to a jury trial while the Investor does not. This could be seen as coercive and may violate principles of contractual fairness and equal protection under the law, by disadvantaging the investor..",

By omitting 'out-of-pocket' and 'reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of counsel,' the revised clause becomes ambiguous and potentially allows the Agent and Lenders to demand reimbursement for unreasonable or inflated expenses. The omission of the reasonableness standard makes the expense clause potentially unenforceable and unfair, contradicting general principles of contract law that require good faith and fair dealing.",

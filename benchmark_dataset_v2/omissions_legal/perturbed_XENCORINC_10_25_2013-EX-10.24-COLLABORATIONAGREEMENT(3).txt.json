                "original_text": "XENCOR and BII shall obtain and/or maintain during the term of this Agreement and for a period of [...***...] thereafter, liability insurance in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the biopharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and the respective activities (i.e. BII as CMO and XENCOR as sponsor/pharmaceutical company) at the respective place of business and such liability insurance shall insure against all mandatory liability, including liability for personal injury, physical injury and property damage. BII shall have the right to reasonably self insure.",
                "changed_text": "XENCOR and BII shall obtain and/or maintain during the term of this Agreement, liability insurance. BII shall have the right to self insure.",
                "explanation": "This removes the requirements of liability insurance in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the biopharmaceutical industry and insures against all mandatory liability, including liability for personal injury, physical injury and property damage, failing to specify minimum coverage amounts or types of liabilities covered, potentially violating standard business practices and relevant regulations related to insurance requirements for businesses operating in California and Germany.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, USA.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'without regard to its conflict of laws provisions' can introduce ambiguity and potentially lead to the application of laws from a different jurisdiction if a conflict of laws analysis suggests it. This omission could potentially undermine predictability and create legal risk, especially if those other laws are less favorable to one of the parties. New York contract law requires a 'choice of law' provision to explicitly waive conflict of law rules to be valid. The omission of that explicitly could contradict that.",

Each Party shall provide reasonable assistance for any action which may be necessary to assign or otherwise transfer such rights to Other Improvements to Parties as joint owners. BII shall have the first right to prosecute and maintain patent rights within the Other Improvements, at its expense, provided that if BII elects not to prosecute or maintain an Other Improvement it shall provide written notice to XENCOR, and XENCOR may elect to take over responsibility for prosecution and maintenance of such Other Improvement, at its own expense, by providing written notice to BII, in which case all rights to such Other Improvement shall be assigned to XENCOR.",

BII shall have the right to prosecute and maintain patent rights within the Other Improvements.",
                "explanation": "The section originally grants XENCOR the right to take over responsibility for prosecution and maintenance of such Other Improvement, at its own expense, by providing written notice to BII, in which case all rights to such Other Improvement shall be assigned to XENCOR. By omitting these sentences, XENCOR is now disallowed to take over responsibility and therefore potentially reducing XENCOR's influence in a key decision.",

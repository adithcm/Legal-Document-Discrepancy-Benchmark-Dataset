                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. While the original clause disclaims these warranties (which may be legally permissible depending on jurisdiction and specific wording), completely removing the disclaimer creates ambiguity and potentially exposes McDATA to implied warranty claims, violating consumer protection laws that assume these warranties unless explicitly disclaimed.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specified jurisdiction of Colorado law. By stating the agreement will be governed by laws chosen by McDATA, it opens the possibility that McDATA could choose laws that are unfavorable to the Reseller or even violate the laws of the jurisdiction where the Reseller operates. This introduces a legal risk because standard business agreements require a specified and unbiased jurisdiction.",

In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be finally resolved in Denver, Colorado (USA) by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, using three arbitrators, one selected by each of McDATA and Reseller and the third selected in accordance with such Rules. The arbitrators will decide the issues presented to them applying the substantive laws of the Sate of Colorado (USA). The award of the arbitrators may be granted notwithstanding the absence of any party and such award shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall not be appealed from or contested in any court or tribunal. Any award rendered hereunder may be entered for enforcement, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the arbitration process defined in the original agreement and replaced it with an unspecificed, McDATA-controlled dispute resolution process. This raises concerns about fairness and impartiality, potentially violating legal principles that ensure a neutral dispute resolution mechanism. The law favors fair arbitration, and giving one party control violates that.",

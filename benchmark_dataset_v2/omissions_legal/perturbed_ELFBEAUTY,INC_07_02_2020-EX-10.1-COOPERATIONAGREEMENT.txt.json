                "original_text": "(g) Governing Law; Choice of Venue.\n\n(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed within that state, without giving effect to any law or principals of law that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "(g) Governing Law; Choice of Venue.\n\n(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction the Company deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed within that state' and replacing it with 'the laws of the jurisdiction the Company deems appropriate' the agreement now allows the company to choose a jurisdiction that may not provide the same consumer protections as Delaware law, potentially violating consumer protection laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Delaware General Corporation Law, potentially other consumer protection laws depending on the jurisdiction the company chooses.",

                "changed_text": "(ii) Each Party (A) consents to submit itself to the jurisdiction determined by the Company in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction, and (D) irrevocably consents to service of process to the address of such Party's principal place of business or as otherwise provided by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specification of Delaware courts and the waiver of jury trial restricts the legal recourse available to the Marathon Parties. This is a legal contradiction because it forces the Marathon Parties to an unknown jurisdiction determined by the company, impacting their due process rights. The change now violates fundamental legal principles, thus contradicting law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of due process, right to a jury trial, and potentially state or federal laws related to jurisdiction and venue in contract disputes.",

                "original_text": "(i) Severability. If at any time subsequent to the date hereof, any provision of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, but the illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon the legality or enforceability of any other provision in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(i) Severability. If at any time subsequent to the date hereof, any provision of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, and the entire agreement will be void.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the severability clause to state that if any part of the agreement is void, the entire agreement is void introduces a legal loophole. This omission may allow the company to void the entire agreement based on a minor infraction, even if other parts of the agreement are beneficial to the Marathon Parties. This is a **legal contradiction** because standard legal practice and severability clauses are intended to preserve as much of the contract as possible, and this change directly contradicts that principle, exposing the Marathon Parties to heightened legal risk.",

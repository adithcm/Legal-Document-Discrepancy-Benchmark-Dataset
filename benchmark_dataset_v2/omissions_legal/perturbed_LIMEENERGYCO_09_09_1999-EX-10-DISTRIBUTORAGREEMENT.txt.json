                "original_text": "Company warrants that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a workmanlike manner and that such Products shall be fully functional and fit for their intended purposes. Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user. The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement. The Distributor at all times shall comply with all requirements of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act and similar federal and state laws and regulations.",

Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship. The Company shall not be liable for defective Products, except as provided in this Agreement. The Distributor shall comply with some requirements of federal and state laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "Removing the explicit 24-month warranty period and weakening the compliance clause relating to warranty laws significantly reduces consumer protection. By deleting the reference to a specific warranty duration and making the compliance vague, the contract creates a legal loophole that could allow the company to avoid obligations under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.",

Company will carry a reasonable amount of product liability insurance through a reasonably acceptable products liability insurance company and will name the Distributor as an additional insured under that policy. Company will make reasonable efforts to procure a policy, which is non-cancelable, except upon thirty (30) days, advance notice to the Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Product Liability Insurance. Company may carry product liability insurance. Company will make efforts to procure a policy.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'will carry a reasonable amount' to 'may carry' and removing the requirement for naming the Distributor as an additional insured, the contract eliminates a crucial safety net for the distributor and end-users. Additionally, removing details about the policy being non-cancelable weakens the protection against sudden policy changes. This omission introduces legal risk related to product liability claims, as Illinois law requires adequate protection for damages caused by defective products.",

                "original_text": "Accrued Obligations. In the event that either Distributor or Company fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement, both Distributor and Company acknowledge and agree that in addition to any claim for damages either party may have arising from the default of the other, they shall have the right to seek equitable relief by way of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction and such other equitable relief as may be appropriate. In the event a party seeks the equitable relief of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, mandatory injunction or specific performance both parties acknowledge that they shall not be required to demonstrate the absence of an adequate remedy at law, and neither party shall be required to post bond as a precondition to obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either party hereto from obligations which have occurred pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement prior to its termination, nor shall it release either party hereto from any obligations which have been incurred as a result of operations conducted under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific details about the types of equitable relief available (temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, etc.) and deleting the waiver of the requirement to demonstrate the absence of an adequate remedy at law weakens the recourse options for the parties. By omitting that both parties shall not be required to post bond as a precondition to obtaining a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is problematic. Illinois law generally requires a party seeking injunctive relief to demonstrate irreparable harm and an inadequate remedy at law, along with posting a bond. The removal of these statements makes it more difficult and costly for a party to obtain equitable relief, potentially shielding the defaulting party from swift corrective action.",

                "original_text": "Adaptimmune Limited shall maintain in full force and effect insurance for its and Adaptimmune's liabilities arising from the Study with limits of not less than $*** per loss and $*** annual aggregate. Adaptimmune shall provide MD Anderson with evidence of such insurance upon request.",
                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune Limited shall maintain insurance for its and Adaptimmune's liabilities arising from the Study. Adaptimmune may provide MD Anderson with evidence of such insurance.",
                "explanation": "The removal of specific insurance limits ($*** per loss and $*** annual aggregate) eliminates a mandated protection for the research institution (MD Anderson) against potential liabilities arising from the study. Additionally, replacing 'shall provide' with 'may provide' makes the provision of proof of insurance discretionary, further weakening MD Anderson's protection. This change introduces a legal risk because many jurisdictions require specific minimum insurance coverage for clinical trials to protect participants and institutions.",

MD Anderson and/or Principal Investigator shall remove Confidential Information of Adaptimmune.",
                "explanation": "This edit grants Adaptimmune complete control over the publication of research results, contradicting the principle of academic freedom and open scientific communication often protected by state laws. Removing the phrase 'in each case to this Article 12' eliminates any reference to MD Anderson's publication rights. The additional context that 'MD Anderson and/or Principal Investigator shall remove Confidential Information of Adaptimmune' gives the full right to Adaptimmune over research outcomes.",

                "original_text": "Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility for reasonable medical expenses incurred by a Study subject for reasonable and necessary treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol that the subject would not have undergone were it not for such Study subject's participation in the Study. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving relevant documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.",

Adaptimmune may refuse to make payments for any Study patient. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving documentation.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall assume responsibility' to 'may assume responsibility' introduces ambiguity and makes the coverage of medical expenses discretionary. Deleting the 'reasonable and necessary' clause and other specifics drastically reduces Adaptimmune's obligations to cover medical costs for injured study participants. Making coverage wholly discretionary makes the contract non-compliant with ethical research guidelines and potentially legal requirements for covering research-related injuries.",

                "original_text": "Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility for reasonable medical expenses incurred by a Study subject for reasonable and necessary treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol that the subject would not have undergone were it not for such Study subject's participation in the Study. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving relevant documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.",
                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune may, at its sole discretion, consider covering medical expenses incurred by a Study subject. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving relevant documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a responsibility for Adaptimmune to cover reasonable medical expenses. The modified text makes this discretionary ('may, at its sole discretion'), removing a potential consumer protection for study participants who suffer injury. This violates basic ethical research principles and potentially regulations regarding participant safety and compensation in clinical trials.",

Adaptimmune shall provide MD Anderson with evidence of such insurance upon request.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of any Study Order under this Agreement, Adaptimmune Limited may choose to maintain insurance for its and Adaptimmune's liabilities arising from the Study. Adaptimmune may provide MD Anderson with evidence of such insurance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that Adaptimmune maintains insurance. The modified text makes maintaining insurance optional ('may choose to maintain'). Furthermore, the requirement to provide proof of insurance is weakened to a discretionary action ('may provide'). This omission introduces a legal risk as it removes a guarantee of financial responsibility for potential harm to study participants, violating requirements for financial protection of clinical trial participants.",

                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune recognizes the value of disseminating research results; however, MD Anderson's right to publish or publicly disclose the results and Data of any Study is subject to Adaptimmune's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause recognizes MD Anderson's right to publish research results. The modified version subordinates this right to Adaptimmune's 'sole discretion'. This constitutes a legal contradiction, as academic institutions like MD Anderson often have a legal and ethical obligation to disseminate research findings. This clause, as modified, could violate academic freedom principles and potentially conflict with public health interests if Adaptimmune withholds important findings.",

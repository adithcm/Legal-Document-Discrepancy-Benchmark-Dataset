                "original_text": "Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility for reasonable medical expenses incurred by a Study subject for reasonable and necessary treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol that the subject would not have undergone were it not for such Study subject's participation in the Study. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving relevant documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.",
                "changed_text": "Adaptimmune may consider assuming responsibility for medical expenses incurred by a Study subject. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility' to 'Adaptimmune may consider assuming responsibility,' the contract introduces ambiguity regarding financial responsibility for injuries during the study. This weakens patient rights, as the original text suggests a more definitive commitment to cover medical expenses. Removing 'reasonable and necessary treatment' introduces additional loophole. It removes the protection for the subjects.",

Adaptimmune shall provide MD Anderson with evidence of such insurance upon request.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'in full force and effect' and the removal of the specific liability limits ($*** per loss and $*** annual aggregate) significantly weakens the insurance requirement. This creates a loophole where Adaptimmune could technically comply with minimal or inadequate coverage, introducing a potential legal contradiction with standard clinical trial insurance requirements. Also the removal of the time frame of insurance provides a loophole.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates adherence to ICMJE guidelines, which ensure fair and accurate attribution of credit for research contributions. Removing this clause gives the parties complete discretion over authorship, potentially leading to unethical practices such as ghost authorship or excluding deserving contributors, undermining research integrity. This creates a loophole where there would be a potential lack of accountability and transparency. Also the removal of this rule can cause a violation since this is in accordance of the ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts.",

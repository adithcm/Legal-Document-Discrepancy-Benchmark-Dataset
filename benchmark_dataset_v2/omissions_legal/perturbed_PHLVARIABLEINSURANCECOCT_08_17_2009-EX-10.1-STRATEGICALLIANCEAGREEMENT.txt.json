The modified clause removes the exceptions and permissions outlined in the original text which directly contradicts the requirements of Regulation S-P, which allows for sharing under specific conditions, and thus introduces legal risk, because now the agreement has more restrictions then the current applicable laws.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the establishment and maintenance of written policies and procedures to protect customer information as required by Rule 30 under Regulation S-P.

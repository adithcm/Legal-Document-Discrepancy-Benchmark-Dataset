                "original_text": "Each party agrees to defend, save and hold harmless the other from and against all suits and claims that may be based on any injury to any person (including death) or to the property of any person or entity arising out of the operations of the indemnifying party or any willful act, negligence or omission of any of the indemnifying party's agents, servants or employees, provided that the indemnified party shall give notice promptly in writing of any suit or claim to the other party and that the indemnified party and its agents, servants and employees shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and its counsel. The indemnifying party shall, at its own cost and expense, pay all charges of attorneys and all costs and other expenses arising therefrom or incurred in connection therewith, provided that it retains the right, at its own expense, to handle any action hereunder by employing its own counsel.",
                "changed_text": "Each party agrees to defend, save and hold harmless the other from and against all suits and claims that may be based on any injury to any person or to the property of any person or entity arising out of the operations of the indemnifying party or any willful act, negligence or omission of any of the indemnifying party's agents, servants or employees, provided that the indemnified party shall give notice promptly in writing of any suit or claim to the other party. The indemnifying party shall have the option to pay charges of attorneys and all costs and other expenses arising therefrom or incurred in connection therewith.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the requirement for the indemnifying party to pay all legal charges and expenses, making it optional. The original text obligates the indemnifying party to cover all legal expenses, thus protecting the indemnified party. By making this optional, the indemnified party may be forced to cover legal costs, contradicting standard indemnification practices and potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, especially in Florida where the contract is governed. It also removes the condition that the indemnified party's agents, servants, and employees fully cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel. This can create a conflict of interest, where the indemnified party could hinder the indemnifying party's defense.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'strict' from 'strict confidence' and eliminating the requirement for 'prior written consent' before disclosing information significantly weakens confidentiality obligations. Under Florida law, certain health information is protected by HIPAA and state confidentiality laws. This change potentially allows for the disclosure of protected health information without consent, which could violate these laws. This alteration creates a legal contradiction and risk of non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'overnight delivery or' and 'registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid' from the notice provisions weakens the assurance of proper notification. Also removing 'Chief Counsel' and 'President' eliminates necessary roles, making it ambiguous that they are the point of contact. Florida law, and general contract law, often requires adequate notice for various actions (e.g., termination, default). Removing these stipulations could lead to disputes over whether proper notice was given, potentially violating legal requirements for sufficient notification and due process, especially for critical contract actions. The risk of not getting the notice can cause damages to the business and cause it to close.",

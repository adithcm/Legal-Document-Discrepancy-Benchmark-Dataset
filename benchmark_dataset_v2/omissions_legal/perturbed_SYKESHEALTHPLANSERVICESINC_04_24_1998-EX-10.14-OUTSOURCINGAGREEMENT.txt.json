                "original_text": "Each party agrees to defend, save and hold harmless the other from and against all suits and claims that may be based on any injury to any person (including death) or to the property of any person or entity arising out of the operations of the indemnifying party or any willful act, negligence or omission of any of the indemnifying party's agents, servants or employees, provided that the indemnified party shall give notice promptly in writing of any suit or claim to the other party and that the indemnified party and its agents, servants and employees shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and its counsel. The indemnifying party shall, at its own cost and expense, pay all charges of attorneys and all costs and other expenses arising therefrom or incurred in connection therewith, provided that it retains the right, at its own expense, to handle any action hereunder by employing its own counsel.",
                "changed_text": "Each party agrees to defend, save and hold harmless the other from and against all suits and claims that may be based on any injury to the property of any person or entity arising out of the operations of the indemnifying party or any willful act, negligence or omission of any of the indemnifying party's agents, servants or employees, provided that the indemnified party shall give notice promptly in writing of any suit or claim to the other party and that the indemnified party and its agents, servants and employees shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and its counsel.

                "explanation": "By removing 'any injury to any person (including death)' from the indemnification clause, the contract fails to adequately protect individuals from potential harm caused by either party's operations. This omission could violate Florida's negligence laws, which hold parties accountable for injuries, including death, resulting from their actions or inactions. The modified clause limits indemnification to property damage only, creating a significant legal risk.",

                "changed_text": "SHPS and HPS each agree that all information communicated to it by the other will be held in strict confidence and will be used only for purposes of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'and that no such information will be disclosed by the recipient party, its agents or employees without the prior written consent of the other party' from the confidentiality clause, there are no constraints on either party's use of information. Florida's trade secret law and patient privacy regulations (HIPAA) are contradicted by this omission. The clause, as modified, implies that even sensitive patient data shared under this agreement could be disclosed without consent, creating a violation.",

                "changed_text": "Where agreement, approval, acceptance, consent, or similar action by either party is required by any provision of this Agreement, such action may be delayed.",
                "explanation": "The phrase “shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld” has been changed to “may be delayed”. This violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in Florida contract law. By explicitly permitting delays in approvals and consents, the clause creates a loophole that allows one party to hinder the performance of the contract without necessarily breaching it, and is a contradiction to business practices for outsourcing agreements.",

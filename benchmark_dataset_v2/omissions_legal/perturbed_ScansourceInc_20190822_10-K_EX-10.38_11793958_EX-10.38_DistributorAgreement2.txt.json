                "explanation": "By changing the return policy to Cisco's 'sole discretion,' the contract removes the legally required minimum return period often mandated by consumer protection laws in many states. This introduces a legal risk as it may violate state laws that guarantee consumers a specific timeframe to return products.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates the limited warranty, contradicting implied warranty laws. Many states have implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Removing any warranty violates those implied warranties.",

                "explanation": "Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, particularly in consumer transactions.

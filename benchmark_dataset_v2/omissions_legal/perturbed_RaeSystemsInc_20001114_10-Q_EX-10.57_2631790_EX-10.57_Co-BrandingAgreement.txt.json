                "explanation": "The original text disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. While disclaiming warranties is common, completely removing the implied warranty of merchantability may violate consumer protection laws, particularly the implied warranty of merchantability. This is especially problematic in California (where NETTAXI is located) under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, which implies certain warranties even when others are disclaimed. This change introduces a potential legal risk because it leaves NETTAXI potentially exposed to claims that its services do not meet basic standards of functionality and quality, which are difficult to completely waive. By making the disclaimer incredibly basic, NETTAXI opens itself to a higher degree of liability.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'at an average rate no lower then $6.50 per one thousand impressions (CPM) payable to NETTAXI' significantly alters the compensation terms. This can be problematic because it eliminates the guaranteed minimum rate, potentially leading to disputes over fair compensation and implying an unfair business practice. California law, under the umbrella of good faith and fair dealing, expects clarity and reasonable financial terms in contracts. The omission creates a loophole allowing for a far lower compensation rate, potentially undermining the financial benefit NETTAXI expects, violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'and the United States' creates ambiguity regarding the applicability of federal laws. While California law is chosen, certain aspects of the agreement (e.g., intellectual property rights) are heavily influenced by federal statutes. Omission could create legal risk and disputes regarding which body of law governs specific aspects of the agreement. While IP rights will be governed by federal law regardless, failing to specify creates a legal ambiguity and increases the potential for disputes regarding interpretation and enforcement, as well as increases the amount of legal fees needed to argue the case in court. There is also the omission of the California court of jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally.",
                "explanation": "The removal of 'telecopied (upon telephonic confirmation of receipt), on the first business day following the date of dispatch if delivered by a recognized next day courier service, or on the third business day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.' limits the acceptable methods for delivering legal notices. Eliminating options like certified mail, which provides proof of delivery, introduces legal risk. Many jurisdictions require specific methods of notice for contractual matters, and restricting these methods could render notices invalid.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that the prevailing party is entitled to collect costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, this modification contradicts the common legal principle and some statutes allowing for the recovery of legal fees by the prevailing party in contract disputes, especially where the contract involves significant commercial interests.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state law (New York, per Section 8.6(a) of the agreement) but many jurisdictions have statutes or common law principles allowing for fee-shifting in contract disputes under certain circumstances.",

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or equity.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree to resolve any disputes through monetary damages only.",
                "explanation": "Removing the entitlement to seek specific performance limits the remedies available. In many contract disputes, especially those involving unique assets or strategic alliances, monetary damages may be insufficient. Denying the right to seek specific performance may contradict legal principles allowing for this remedy when monetary damages are inadequate.",

Naked hereby engages Wade for collaboration in business development for, and his endorsement as set forth herein of, the following items, which shall be known herein as \"Innerwear\": Briefs, trunks, boxer briefs and boxers, non-athletic undershirts (i.e., t-shirts intended to be worn as innerwear and not intended specifically for athletic purposes), non-athletic lounge apparel (bottoms and tops), sleepwear (including pajama bottoms and tops), and robes (as may be expanded to include other mutually agreed upon innerwear and lounge apparel) which may now or hereafter during the Term be manufactured, distributed, marketed and/or sold by Naked (collectively, the \"Naked Products\"), and Wade hereby accepts such engagement. The Parties agree that the territory of such engagement shall be worldwide (the \"Territory\").",

Naked hereby engages Wade for collaboration in business development for, and his endorsement as set forth herein of, certain items which may now or hereafter during the Term be manufactured, distributed, marketed and/or sold by Naked (collectively, the \"Naked Products\"), and Wade hereby accepts such engagement. The Parties agree that the territory of such engagement shall be worldwide (the \"Territory\").",
                "explanation": "The original text specifically defined 'Innerwear', which is used extensively throughout the contract. By removing this definition but continuing to use the term 'Innerwear' in subsequent clauses, the contract becomes internally inconsistent, as the exact scope of Wade's endorsement is no longer clearly defined. This creates uncertainty about which products are covered by the agreement.",

In the absence of disapproval within three (3) business days of Wade's or authorized agent's receipt of a request for approval, said advertising or promotional material shall be deemed approved.', it creates an ambiguity as to if Naked needs to get an approval from Wade, and if the withholding is reasonable or not.

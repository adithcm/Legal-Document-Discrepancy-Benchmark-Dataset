                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Pursuant and subject to Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of the Statement on Schedule 13D to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing of a statement to which this Joint Filing Agreement is attached, and any amendments thereto may be filed without the necessity of filing additional joint filing agreements.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended' the contract introduces ambiguity about the specific regulatory framework governing the joint filing. If later sections refer to compliance with SEC regulations (which are implied but not explicitly stated after this change), this creates an internal contradiction, especially if another section omits that explicit compliance clause, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "changed_text": "The execution and filing of this agreement shall not be considered an admission of any specific association between the parties.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'are a group or have acted as a group' to 'any specific association between the parties', it broadens the scope of what is *not* being admitted. If another clause later relies on the assumption of *some* form of association for liability or responsibility, this change can create a contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in multiple copies.",
                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument' introduces uncertainty.  If a dispute arises and different copies have slight variations (typos, etc.), it becomes unclear which copy constitutes the definitive agreement. If another section outlines dispute resolution based on 'the original agreement,' the lack of a clearly defined original creates a contradiction.",

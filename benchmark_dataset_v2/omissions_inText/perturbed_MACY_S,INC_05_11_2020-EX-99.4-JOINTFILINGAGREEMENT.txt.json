The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of any amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the undersigned or contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the undersigned or contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others,' the clause now implies that all parties are responsible for *all* information, contradicting the original intent of shared but not universal responsibility. This creates ambiguity about liability in case of inaccuracies.",

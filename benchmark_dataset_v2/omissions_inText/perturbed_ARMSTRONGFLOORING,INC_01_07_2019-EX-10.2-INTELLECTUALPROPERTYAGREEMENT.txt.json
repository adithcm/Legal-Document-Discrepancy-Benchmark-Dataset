Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain, record, and perfect title to, and provide all necessary evidence of the Company's ownership of, the Arizona Assigned IP, including the execution of (i) a Patent Assignment in the form of the attached Exhibit B, and (ii) a Trademark Assignment in the form of the attached Exhibit C.",

                "explanation": "By omitting section 2.1, the contract references the recordation of assignment of 'Arizona Assigned IP' without first establishing that Arizona has actually agreed to assign these rights. This creates an internal contradiction because later sections assume the transfer has occurred, yet the initial agreement to transfer is missing. This makes enforcement of the agreement to provide necessary cooperation to transfer rights doubtful.",

                "explanation": "By omitting clause (f) of Section 6.3 regarding the prohibition of using trademarks confusingly similar to Seller Licensed Trademarks, an in-text contradiction is introduced. Other clauses in the same section focus on maintaining the quality and integrity of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, while the omission of clause (f) opens the door for the Company to use confusingly similar trademarks, which would dilute and potentially damage the goodwill of the original trademarks. This creates ambiguity and weakens Arizona's protection of its trademarks.",

                "explanation": "By omitting section 12.2 (a) Effect of Termination, the contract specifies the conditions for termination but not the consequences, creating a contradiction. Section 12.1 defines the term and termination conditions, but without 12.2(a), it's unclear what the licensee must do upon termination. Other sections related to the Licensed IP may be interpreted differently now, as what a licensee must or must not do is not fully defined. The contract now lacks clarity, creating uncertainty and a need for external interpretation.",

                "original_text": "1.1.7 Actual revenues: means the revenues payable by Party B to Party A based on the amount of search traffic generated by Party A's website for Party B, less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges. The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party B based on its statistical data.",

The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, will be mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the phrase 'less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges' and replacing 'shall be determined by Party B based on its statistical data' with 'will be mutually agreed upon', the definition of Actual Revenues becomes contradictory. Section 5.2.2 still refers to calculating revenues based on traffic (implying Party B's data), but this altered definition suggests a mutual agreement, creating confusion in how actual revenues are calculated and enforced.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific requirement to comply with the 'Business Cooperation Standard of Baidu Union' and replacing it with a vague 'adhere to general business ethics', while still referencing participation in the 'Blue Sky 365' Action Plan, the contract creates an internal contradiction. The original clause explicitly links Party A's compliance with specific standards (defined in Annex 3) to avoiding breach, whereas the edited text removes this specific obligation, making enforcement related to business standards ambiguous. The link with 'Blue Sky 365' still there, and the contradiction makes this link even more unclear and hard to enforce.",

The details of revenue sharing will be determined separately in writing. Party A shall bear the taxes payable on its own share of revenues.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specific conditions and percentage breakdowns for revenue sharing based on default traffic thresholds (points 1-9), the contract introduces ambiguity. While the overall principle of proportionate division is maintained and it still refers to 'actual revenues', which definition has been modified to be ambiguous, the precise method of calculation is left undefined. This creates an internal contradiction because the original clause intended to provide clarity, but now leaves room for dispute. The part 'The details of revenue sharing will be determined separately in writing' creates an uncertainty and it cannot be used to enforce the old one, since it would require a newer document.",

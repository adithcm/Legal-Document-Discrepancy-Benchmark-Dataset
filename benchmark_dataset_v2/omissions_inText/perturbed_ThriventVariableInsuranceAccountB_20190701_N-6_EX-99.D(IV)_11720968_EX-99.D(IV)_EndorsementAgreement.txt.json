If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",

The changed text removes these specifics, creating uncertainty about how the extra payment is calculated and how interest will accrue. The definition of how it is calculate conflicts between the sections.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that dividends are not expected because the contract is not expected to contribute to divisible surplus. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating dividends 'may' be credited, contradicting the original expectation of no dividends. This creates an inconsistency about dividend eligibility.",

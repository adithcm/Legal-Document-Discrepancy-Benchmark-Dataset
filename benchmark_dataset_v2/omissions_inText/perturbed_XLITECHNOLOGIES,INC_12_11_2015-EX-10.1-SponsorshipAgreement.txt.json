                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'as \"Light Sheets\", as further defined in Attachment A [Sponsor Benefits Schedule] attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.', the contract no longer explicitly defines how XLI products should be referenced, or even references Attachment A which contains definitions of the 'Light Sheets.' The term \"Light Sheets\" is now undefined, leading to ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'in accordance with Attachment B, which shall be deemed a part of this Agreement' creates an issue since it describes how XLI will pay WCC, but that method is not defined. This will have uncertainty in enforcement, since the means of payment is not specifically provided for within the contract.",

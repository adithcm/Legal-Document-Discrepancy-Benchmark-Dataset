                "changed_text": "1.6 \"Licensed Mark\" means the stylized mark \"H\".",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to USPTO Registration No. 5,283,875 and Exhibit \"A\", the definition of \"Licensed Mark\" becomes ambiguous. Later sections referencing the specific depiction of the mark in Exhibit A will become unenforceable due to the missing exhibit. This creates uncertainty regarding the exact visual representation of the Licensed Mark.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Licensed Mark' from this section, a contradiction is created. The agreement still grants a license to use the Licensed Mark in Article 2.1, but now provides no clear requirement to cease its use upon termination. This omission creates an inconsistency, potentially allowing the Licensee to argue continued use of the mark after the agreement ends.",

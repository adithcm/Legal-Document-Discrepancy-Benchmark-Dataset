You must maintain insurance related to your operation of the Franchised Business. Such insurance coverage will include: 5.5.1 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: broad form comprehensive general liability coverage against claims for employment practices coverage, bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the conduct of business by you pursuant to this Agreement and broad form contractual liability coverage, including errors and omissions coverage, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage prescribed by us from time to time, but in no event in an amount less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate. Such insurance shall not have a deductible or self-insured retention in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000); 5.5.2 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: automobile liability insurance coverage, including owned and non-owned vehicles, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence; 5.5.3 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance in statutory amounts, unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as required by governing law for your employees; 5.5.4 As it relates to the Unit Franchisees' operation in the Master Territory, and if you elect to obtain such coverage: general liability insurance, which insurance is in addition to any general liability insurance the Unit Franchisees are required to maintain under their Unit Franchise Agreements. You shall also maintain such additional insurance as is necessary to comply with all legal requirements concerning insurance. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance at any time including excess liability insurance to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances. The insurance policies required herein shall: (a) name us as an additional named insured and contain a waiver of all subrogation rights against us, our affiliates, and our and their successors and assigns; (b) provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to us of any material modification, cancellation, or expiration of such policy; (c) provide that the coverage applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is brought as though a separate policy had been issued to each insured; (d) contain no provision which in any way limits or reduces coverage for you in the event of a claim by any one or more of the parties indemnified under this Agreement; (e) be primary to and without right of contribution from any other insurance purchased by the parties indemnified under this Agreement; and (f) extend to and provide indemnity for all obligations assumed by you hereunder and all other items for which you are required to indemnify us under this Agreement. You shall provide us with evidence of the insurance required hereunder not later than ten (10) days before you begin operating as a Master Franchisee, and with a complete copy of each insurance policy no more than thirty (30) days after delivery of the original proof of insurance. Thereafter, prior to the expiration of the term of each insurance policy, you shall furnish us with a copy of each renewal or replacement insurance policy to be maintained by you for the immediately following term and evidence of the payment of the premium therefor. Should you, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, as such requirements may be revised from time to time by us in writing, we shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to you, which charges shall be payable by you immediately upon notice together with a ten percent (10%) administrative fee. The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity. The maintenance of sufficient insurance coverage shall be your responsibility. Your obligations to maintain insurance coverage as herein described shall not be affected in any manner by reason of any separate insurance maintained by us nor shall the maintenance of such insurance relieve you of any indemnification obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific insurance requirements (amounts, types, conditions) creates a scenario where the 'insurance coverage' requirement is vague. While the contract indicates insurance is needed, it fails to specify the details creating a significant enforcement issue and potential for disputes about what constitutes sufficient insurance. This contradiction also omits the franchisee's obligation to name the franchisor as an additional insured, which would give rise to a dispute.",

                "explanation": "The clause indicating a minimum spend of 5000 USD is removed. This would introduce uncertainty in enforcement since the obligation to expend funds remains but the specific amount is undefined. It contradicts the initial statement requiring advertising and undermines the franchisor's control over advertising standards as they relate to expenditure levels and volume.",

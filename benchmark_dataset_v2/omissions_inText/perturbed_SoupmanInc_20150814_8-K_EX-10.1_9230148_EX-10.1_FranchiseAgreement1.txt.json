The statement \"spent by you in accordance with the agreement on behalf of the franchisor and Franchisees,\" specifically points to an agreement that no longer exists as 'National Advertising Fund' no longer means anything.",

You must maintain insurance related to your operation of the Franchised Business. Such insurance coverage will include: 5.5.1 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: broad form comprehensive general liability coverage against claims for employment practices coverage, bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the conduct of business by you pursuant to this Agreement and broad form contractual liability coverage, including errors and omissions coverage, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage prescribed by us from time to time, but in no event in an amount less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate. Such insurance shall not have a deductible or self-insured retention in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000); 5.5.2 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: automobile liability insurance coverage, including owned and non-owned vehicles, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence; 5.5.3 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance in statutory amounts, unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as required by governing law for your employees; 5.5.4 As it relates to the Unit Franchisees' operation in the Master Territory, and if you elect to obtain such coverage: general liability insurance, which insurance is in addition to any general liability insurance the Unit Franchisees are required to maintain under their Unit Franchise Agreements. You shall also maintain such additional insurance as is necessary to comply with all legal requirements concerning insurance. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance at any time including excess liability insurance to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances. The insurance policies required herein shall: (a) name us as an additional named insured and contain a waiver of all subrogation rights against us, our affiliates, and our and their successors and assigns; (b) provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to us of any material modification, cancellation, or expiration of such policy; (c) provide that the coverage applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is brought as though a separate policy had been issued to each insured; (d) contain no provision which in any way limits or reduces coverage for you in the event of a claim by any one or more of the parties indemnified under this Agreement; (e) be primary to and without right of contribution from any other insurance purchased by the parties indemnified under this Agreement; and (f) extend to and provide indemnity for all obligations assumed by you hereunder and all other items for which you are required to indemnify us under this Agreement. You shall provide us with evidence of the insurance required hereunder not later than ten (10) days before you begin operating as a Master Franchisee, and with a complete copy of each insurance policy no more than thirty (30) days after delivery of the original proof of insurance. Thereafter, prior to the expiration of the term of each insurance policy, you shall furnish us with a copy of each renewal or replacement insurance policy to be maintained by you for the immediately following term and evidence of the payment of the premium therefor. Should you, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, as such requirements may be revised from time to time by us in writing, we shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to you, which charges shall be payable by you immediately upon notice together with a ten percent (10%) administrative fee. The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity. The maintenance of sufficient insurance coverage shall be your responsibility. Your obligations to maintain insurance coverage as herein described shall not be affected in any manner by reason of any separate insurance maintained by us nor shall the maintenance of such insurance relieve you of any indemnification obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing clauses 5.5.1-5.5.4 and (a)-(f), the contract now vaguely states that the franchisee needs 'insurance coverage as we from time to time require', but does not specify what insurance. It states additional insurance to comply with legal requirements, but the definition of legal requirements is unclear. This creates potential conflict in what is an acceptable insurance policy.",

In the event of termination for any default of yours, such sums shall include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default, which obligation shall give rise to and remain, until paid in full, a lien in our favor against any and all leasehold improvements, fixtures, furnishings and equipment, inventory, supplies and vehicles located at or used in connection with the Franchised Business, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. We shall have full power and authority to file such documents as are necessary to obtain and perfect such lien. We shall have the right to set off any amounts which we deem are payable to us by you. 11.4.2 In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement by us for cause as described in Section 10, you agree to pay to us within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this Agreement's termination, in addition to the amounts owed hereunder, liquidated damages equal to the average monthly Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee you paid during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (a) twenty-four (24) (being the number of months in two (2) full years), or (b) the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated, whichever is lower. 11.4.3 The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would be impracticable to determine precisely the damages we would incur from this Agreement's termination and the loss of cash flow from Royalty Fees due to, among other things, the complications of determining what costs, if any, we might have saved and how much the Royalty Fees would have grown over what would have been this Agreement's remaining term. The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages. 11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.",

                "explanation": "By removing clauses 11.4.2-11.4.4, this creates an inconsistency as it removes specifics of how liquidated damages is defined, and also states an obligation to a liquidated damage amount cannot be determined. This will make the ability to enforce this clause problematic as the text itself states that amounts cannot be determined.",

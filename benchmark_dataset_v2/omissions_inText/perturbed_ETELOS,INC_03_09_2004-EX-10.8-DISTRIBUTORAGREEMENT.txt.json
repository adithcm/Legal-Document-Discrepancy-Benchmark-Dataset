                "changed_text": "1. Products 1.1 \"Products\" means all products that distributor sells.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Products' limited it to Tripath semiconductor products identified in writing. The modified definition broadens it to all products the distributor sells. This creates a contradiction if other sections of the agreement still assume 'Products' refers only to Tripath's offerings. This also introduces uncertainty in enforcement, as the agreement will now be interpreted under an ambiguous definition.",

                "explanation": "The omission of 'immediately upon written notice to Distributor' removes the requirement for Tripath to notify the Distributor before making direct sales. This contradicts the Distributor's expected sales practices and potentially undermines the agreement's intention for collaboration. If Section 2.2 requires distributors to use best efforts to develop the local market, but the distributor does not need to give notice, enforcement becomes uncertain.",

                "original_text": "10. Limited Warranty 10.1 Tripath provides an end user limited warranty for retail Products, and one-year limited warranty for OEM products. The terms of the end user limited warranty are set forth in documentation provided with the retail Product. 10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath warrants that the Products will be free of manufacturing and workmanship defects for one year from the date of shipment by Distributor to a customer, or eighteen months from the date of shipment to Distributor, whichever is sooner. 10.3 If any OEM Products prove defective during this one year period as set forth in Section 10.2, Tripath will, at its option, either (a) repair or replace the Product with a new or reconditioned Product, (b) use reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with a correction of the defect, or (c) refund to Distributor the purchase price paid for the Product. Any Product replaced will become Tripath property. 10.4 Distributor must return the defective OEM Product pursuant to a return material authorization under Section 9.1 in the original shipping carton (or an equivalent protective carton), and pay the shipping and insurance charges. Distributor assumes the risk of loss or damage during shipment. 10.5 OEM Products that are defective as set forth in Section 10.2 as a result of improper handling, incorrect installation or other misuse, or as a result of accident, disaster, acts of God or other such events, as determined by Tripath in its reasonable discretion, are not covered by this limited warranty. 10.6 For OEM Products, Tripath provides only the warranties set forth in this limited one year limited warranty. For retail Products, Tripath provides to the end user only the warranties set forth in the applicable end user warranty.",
                "changed_text": "10. Limited Warranty 10.1 Tripath provides a warranty as described in their policy documents for end users. Any and all other warranties, either express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, or of merchantability, are hereby expressly excluded and disclaimed by Tripath.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific warranty details for OEM products and referencing only 'policy documents for end users', while still implying there's a warranty for all products, the contract becomes contradictory. The distributor is left unsure of the OEM warranty terms, and the disclaimer potentially clashes with the statement that a warranty exists elsewhere. This introduces uncertainty in enforcement, especially if the policy documents do not fully align with the original detailed warranty provisions.",

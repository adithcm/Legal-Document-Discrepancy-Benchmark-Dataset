The terms of the end user limited warranty are set forth in documentation provided with the retail Product.\n\n10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath warrants that the Products will be free of manufacturing and workmanship defects for one year from the date of shipment by Distributor to a customer, or eighteen months from the date of shipment to Distributor, whichever is sooner.\n\n10.3 If any OEM Products prove defective during this one year period as set forth in Section 10.2, Tripath will, at its option, either (a) repair or replace the Product with a new or reconditioned Product, (b) use reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with a correction of the defect, or (c) refund to Distributor the purchase price paid for the Product. Any Product replaced will become Tripath property.\n\n10.4 Distributor must return the defective OEM Product pursuant to a return material authorization under Section 9.1 in the original shipping carton (or an equivalent protective carton), and pay the shipping and insurance charges. Distributor assumes the risk of loss or damage during shipment.\n\n10.5 OEM Products that are defective as set forth in Section 10.2 as a result of improper handling, incorrect installation or other misuse, or as a result of accident, disaster, acts of God or other such events, as determined by Tripath in its reasonable discretion, are not covered by this limited warranty.\n\n10.6 For OEM Products, Tripath provides only the warranties set forth in this limited one year limited warranty. For retail Products, Tripath provides to the end user only the warranties set forth in the applicable end user warranty. Any and all other warranties, either express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, or of merchantability, are hereby expressly excluded and disclaimed by Tripath.",
                "changed_text": "10. Limited Warranty\n\n10.1 Tripath provides a warranty for Products. The specific terms of the warranty will be provided at the time of purchase. Tripath reserves the right to modify or discontinue this warranty at any time without prior notice. Tripath will determine, in its sole discretion, whether a product is covered under warranty.\n\n10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath ensures that products meet standard industry specifications at the point of distribution.\n\n10.3 If any OEM Products fail to meet quality expectations, Tripath will assess the situation based on internal policies.\n\n10.4 Distributor must handle any product returns according to Tripath’s product handling procedures.\n\n10.5 OEM Products damaged as a result of any unforeseen circumstances or improper usage are subject to quality checks.\n\n10.6 Tripath reserves all rights to define the scope and limitations of the warranty, which may change over time. Any other forms of warranties are not applicable.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces significant ambiguity and contradiction regarding the warranty terms. The original text clearly defines the warranty period and conditions for both retail and OEM products, while the modified text replaces specific details with vague references to unspecified terms provided 'at the time of purchase' or 'internal policies'. By removing the one-year warranty period and detailed conditions, the contract creates uncertainty about what constitutes a covered defect, the duration of the warranty, and the remedies available. The statement that Tripath reserves the right to modify or discontinue the warranty at any time without notice contradicts the implied assurance of a defined warranty in Section 10.1 of the original text, making enforcement unclear.",

All authorized returns will be shipped by Distributor freight prepaid. Unauthorized returns may be reshipped to Distributor, freight collect.\n\n9.2 Distributor may request stock rotation return of slow moving Products, which will be authorized by Tripath provided that: (a) the Product is contained in Tripath's then current Distributor Price List, (b) the Product is packaged as it was originally shipped, and (c) a purchase order for equal value accompanies the request for return. Such stock rotation returns will not exceed five percent (5%) of the dollar value of Distributor's previous six (6) months net purchase orders from Tripath.\n\n9.3 Discontinued Product may be returned only with prior written authorization.\n\n9.4 Credit will be allowed for returned Products based on the price actually paid by Distributor, less any prior DPAs, credits and other allowances.\n\n9.5 If, in the reasonable opinion of Tripath, previously authorized returned Products have been used or damaged, a credit or replacement may be refused. Distributor will be notified within one month after receipt of Product by Tripath of any such Product Tripath is claiming to be used or damaged.",

All returns will be subject to Tripath approval.\n\n9.2 Stock rotation will be handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\n9.3 Discontinued Products are typically non-returnable.\n\n9.4 Credit for returns will be determined by Tripath’s accounting department.\n\n9.5 Tripath reserves the right to refuse returns of used or damaged products based on its assessment.",
                "explanation": "This change removes specific conditions for returns, especially regarding stock rotation, and replaces them with vague references to 'Tripath's return policies' and case-by-case evaluations. The original text outlines precise criteria for stock rotation returns (listing on price list, original packaging, purchase order of equal value, and percentage limits), while the modified text eliminates these criteria, making stock rotation returns entirely discretionary. By removing these concrete guidelines, the contract creates uncertainty about the Distributor's right to return slow-moving Products, undermining the original agreement's provisions.",

Pricing, credits, and allowances\n\n6.1 Prices for Products will be as set forth in the then effective distributor price list (\"Distributor Price List\") which will be furnished to Distributor from time to time. Any suggested resale prices shown in the Distributor Price List are to be considered as guidelines only.\n\n6.2 The Distributor Price List may be changed without prior notice, and will be effective as of the effective date indicated. The amount and timing of such change will be exclusively at Tripath's discretion.\n\n6.3 Orders for Products received and acknowledged by Tripath prior to a change in the Price List but shipped after the effective date of such change will be invoiced as follows: (a) in the case of a price decrease, the existing order backlog will be invoiced at the lower price, and (b) in the case of a price increase, the existing order backlog due for delivery within one month of the effective date of such change will be invoiced at the lower price. Outstanding written quotations will be held good for the same two-month period.\n\n6.4 Distributor's inventory of any Product will be price protected for reductions in the price of such Product as follows: the lesser of Distributor's (a) entire inventory of the Product, or (b) previous one month's shipments of the Product from Tripath.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces contradictions by making pricing, credits, and allowances much more discretionary. The original agreement mentions the Distributor Price List and outlines how price changes affect existing orders and provides inventory price protection. The modified text removes specific mechanisms and timelines, stating that 'invoices will reflect the prices in effect at the time of shipment' and that 'price protection is not guaranteed'. This contradicts the Distributor's expectation of price stability based on previous agreements, as specified in 6.3 and 6.4 in the original agreement, creating uncertainty in forecasting and profitability. The removal of objective criteria (like 'Distributor Price List') makes pricing arbitrary.",

Any customers who do not specifically opt-in to receiving email communications from EFS shall be excluded from such communications.",

Customers may be included in email communications from EFS.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause stating 'Any customers who do not specifically opt-in to receiving email communications from EFS shall be excluded from such communications,' the modified text contradicts standard data privacy practices and potentially violates laws like GDPR or CAN-SPAM. The change suggests that EFS can now email customers without explicit consent, conflicting with generally accepted practices and potentially creating legal issues if other sections of the contract mention compliance with data privacy regulations.",

The modified text omits the 'not to be unreasonably withheld' condition and reference to Section 1.1(d)(iii), giving the client full arbitrary power over the website and catalog design without referencing style guides. This makes the enforcement ambiguous, as the specific design, consistency guidelines, and the 'unreasonably withheld' clause have been removed, potentially leading to disagreements over approval rights.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed definition of 'Project Completion' in section A, while section B still refers to completion, creates ambiguity. The new definition, which says Project Completion will be determined based on mutual agreement creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the original objective criteria are no longer present.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Products' is changed from 'casual apparel consisting of men's pants, shirts, sweaters, windshirts and raingear' to 'apparel'. This broadens the product scope considerably, potentially leading to disputes over whether specific items are covered by the agreement. Additionally, the definition of Outerwear is now 'apparel worn by Duval when he plays golf', removing the specific details from the original definition. The definition of Exempt Status is also modified to be any professional tour instead of the PGA Tour. These changes create ambiguity and potential contradictions with other sections of the agreement that may rely on the original, more specific definitions, especially concerning remuneration based on PGA Tour events.",

It also removes the amount of the Additional License Fee. This contradicts Section 5, which details 'Additional Remuneration' based on Duval's accomplishments. The alteration makes the total remuneration unclear, creating uncertainty about the payments Licensor is entitled to and whether the additional license fee is applicable and what amount.",

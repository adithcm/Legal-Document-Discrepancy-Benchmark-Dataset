                "explanation": "The removal of the definition of 'Service Fee' and the section regarding potential waiver of the service fee creates ambiguity. Later sections and Schedule 1 still reference 'Service Fee', but without a clear definition of whether it is [service fees] or [commissions and service fees], creating uncertainty on payment calculation and enforcement. In addition, without the waiver the contract is more strict and the Service Recipient won't have a clause to point back to in case of losses.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that excludes Transferred IP, Conformis Background IP, Stryker Background IP, Improved Conformis Background IP and Improved Stryker Background IP from the definition of KIB Product IP, we create a contradiction. Later sections may rely on the assumption that KIB Product IP is distinct from these other IP categories. Now, KIB Product IP could arguably include these, leading to uncertainty in ownership and licensing rights.",

Stryker shall make all payments to Conformis required herein by wire transfer in accordance with the Wire\nInstructions. Such payments are non-refundable and non-creditable except as set forth in the Other Agreements.",

Such payments are non-refundable and non-creditable except as set forth in the Other Agreements.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific milestone payment amounts creates a contradiction. While section 3.5 references, it is made ambiguous, and will potentially cause enforcement issues. This implies that milestone payments are subject to future negotiation, which may contradict other sections that assume fixed payment amounts. This change also directly effects clauses relating to termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific milestone-based end date, the contract now states that the agreement continues indefinitely. This contradicts the premise of a research and development agreement that is implicitly task based. All clauses related to deliverables become far less enforceable, creating uncertainty.",

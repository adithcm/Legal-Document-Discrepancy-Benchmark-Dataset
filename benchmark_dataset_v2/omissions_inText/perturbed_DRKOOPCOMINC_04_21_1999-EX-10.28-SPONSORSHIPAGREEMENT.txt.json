                "original_text": "9.2.  ARBITRATION. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or concerning the respective rights or obligations of the parties hereto shall be settled and determined by arbitration in the defending parties home forum before one (1) arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. Each party shall have no longer than three (3) days to present its position. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement. The parties agree that the arbitrators shall have the power to award damages, injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses to any party in such arbitration.",
                "changed_text": "9.2.  ARBITRATION. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or concerning the respective rights or obligations of the parties hereto shall be settled and determined by a method agreed upon by both parties. Each party will have a reasonable opportunity to present its position. Judgment upon the resolution may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to arbitration under the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and its Commercial Rules, while still mentioning that disputes will be settled and determined, the modified text creates uncertainty. The original clause specifies a clear and enforceable method for dispute resolution, including the number of arbitrators and time to present. The modified version replaces this with a vague 'method agreed upon by both parties,' introducing ambiguity about what happens if the parties cannot agree on a method.",

Sponsor shall be liable for the conduct of its employees, agents and representatives who in any way breach this Amendment.

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'The User Data shall be drkoop.com Confidential Information under Article 5 and shall in addition be subject to the terms of this Article 3', the agreement now creates a contradiction. While the Sponsor's obligations regarding User Data survive termination, the agreement no longer explicitly defines User Data as Confidential Information under Article 5. This implies that Article 5's confidentiality terms may not apply to User Data, despite the surviving obligation to treat it in some undefined confidential manner after termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that extends the term of the agreement, the Sponsor's sole remedy for failing to deliver impressions is now subject to future negotiations. This undermines the previously defined obligation and makes the resolution of failure less certain and potentially unenforceable under the original terms.",

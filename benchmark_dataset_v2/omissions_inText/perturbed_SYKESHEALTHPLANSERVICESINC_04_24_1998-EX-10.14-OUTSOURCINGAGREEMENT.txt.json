HPS agrees to outsource to SHPS, and hereby appoints SHPS as the exclusive provider of, Care Management Services to the Clients, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. SHPS shall provide the Care Management Services directly to the Clients in accordance with the terms of the Client Agreements. \"Care Management Services\" means the business of providing utilization review (which includes, but is not limited to, pre-admission certification, prior authorization, prospective length of stay approvals, second opinions, concurrent review and discharge planning), catastrophic medical case management, disease management and demand management (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) services to benefits payors and health providers, in all cases in accordance with the terms of the applicable Client Agreement.",

HPS agrees to outsource to SHPS, and hereby appoints SHPS as a provider of, services to the Clients, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. SHPS shall provide the services directly to the Clients in accordance with the terms of the Client Agreements. \"Services\" means certain tasks agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the specific definition of 'Care Management Services', replacing it with a vague 'Services' and a broad definition. Later clauses referring to 'Care Management Revenues' and specific obligations related to 'Care Management Services' now lack a clear definitional anchor, leading to potential disputes over the scope of SHPS's responsibilities and the corresponding payments. It also changes `exclusive provider` to `a provider`, undermining the initial agreement.",

For each month during the term of this Agreement, HPS will pay to SHPS an amount equal to (i) eighty-two and one-half percent (82.5%) of the first $500,000 of Care Management Revenues (as defined below) during such month plus (ii) eighty percent (80%) of Care Management Revenues during such month in excess of $500,000. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.1 and Care Management Revenues by Client.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 FEES FOR CURRENT HPS CLIENTS. For each month during the term of this Agreement, HPS will pay to SHPS an amount based on a mutually agreed upon formula. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.1 and revenues by Client.",
                "explanation": "The change eliminates the specific percentages and revenue thresholds for calculating fees related to 'Care Management Revenues'. This directly contradicts the original detailed payment structure and creates ambiguity because the 'mutually agreed upon formula' is not defined anywhere in the modified contract. Without a clear formula, the enforcement of payment obligations becomes highly uncertain. Furthermore, it removes the 'Care Management Revenues' clarification creating an inconsistency.",

                "original_text": "2.2 CALCULATION OF CARE MANAGEMENT REVENUES. \"Care Management Revenues\" means, with respect to any month during the term, the revenues collected by HPS from Clients (or new Clients, as applicable) for the Care Management Services. Monthly revenues for Care Management Services shall be calculated based on a per employee per month fee equal to: (i) the amount (as of the date of this Agreement) set forth in the applicable Client Agreement (including hourly medical case management fees); or (ii) if the Client Agreement does not include a per employee per month fee for Care Management Services, $2.00 (this amount shall apply to all individual and small group business). Prospectively, for new Clients, SHPS and HPS shall agree to the rate HPS will offer to such new Clients (including hourly medical case management fees).",
                "changed_text": "2.2 REVENUE CALCULATION. Revenues will be calculated based on market rates.",
                "explanation": "By severely shortening the definition of the revenue calculation, the contract now lacks the details needed to determine what a service costs. The removal of specific per-employee-per-month fee guidelines, and the replacement of this with 'market rates', creates an internal contradiction as it conflicts with the initial expectation of how fees should be handled. The removal of 'Care Management Revenues' when that term is mentioned elsewhere is also an inconsistency. The uncertainty introduced opens the door for possible monetary and legal issues. The initial contract also makes mention to hourly medical case management fees which is now removed.",

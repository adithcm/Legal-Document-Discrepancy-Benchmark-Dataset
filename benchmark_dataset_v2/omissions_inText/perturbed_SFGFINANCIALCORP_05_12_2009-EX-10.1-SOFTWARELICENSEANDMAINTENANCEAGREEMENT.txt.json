The \"Field of Use\" shall not include any functions or applications not expressly described in the preceding sentence, but shall include functions or applications developed by Licensor to enhance the performance within the \"Field of Use\".",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"FIELD OF USE\" was tightly restricted to Spot FX transactions. By removing 'and is limited to, the utilization of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee for the exclusive purpose of fulfilling Spot FX transactions by transmitting market data and orders.' we introduce ambiguity. The modified definition now broadly allows the Licensee to utilize the Licensed Technology for unspecified purposes, contradicting later sections that assume the Licensee's usage is limited to FX transactions.",

The Licensee expressly agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Licensee is not licensed to, and Licensee expressly agrees that it shall not(and shall not permit any third party to); viii. The Licensee acknowledges and understands that accessing the Licensed Technology triggers and constitutes a renewed assumption of such liabilities and risk. i. The Licensee agrees that neither the Licensor, nor any of its respective affiliates, employees, officers, or agents, shall be liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense, (direct or indirect) except for direct damages arising from the gross negligence of willful misconduct of the Licensor. ii. Licensor shall assume no liability, both contingent and otherwise, which may arise out of or be in any way related to the following; (a) furnishing, performance, maintenance, use of, or inability to use all or any part of the system, (b) any fault in the delivery or operation of the system, (c) suspension or termination of the Licensee's ability to use all or part of the system, or any inaccuracies or omissions in any information or documentation provided, (d) any failure or delay suffered or allegedly suffered by Licensee in initiating and terminating trades, (e) the termination of all or part of this Licensee Agreement by the Licensor, (f) the termination or modification of any and all parts of the License.",

                "explanation": "The original section outlines limitations of liability for the Licensor related to the performance and use of the system. Removing the clauses relating to liability limits creates an inconsistency. The Licensee continues to assume liabilities and risk, while the contract fails to delineate the protections afforded to the Licensor against the same risks. This may contradict clauses in Article XII on Indemnity, creating enforceability issues regarding liability.",

Record Keeping and Reports (a) As a condition of Licensee receiving the grant of a license herein, Licensee agrees to maintain reasonable records relating to all trades conducted through the Licensed Technology and all other uses of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee under this Agreement. Licensee shall prepare and submit summary quarterly reports to Licensor no later than 20 days following the last business day of each calendar quarter, which reports must specify a complete record of usage of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee and shall accompany the payments made to Licensor. (b) Licensee agrees to allow an independent Certified Public Accountant or other Audit Professional, (selected by mutual agreement) to audit and analyze appropriate accounting records to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any such audit shall be permitted by Licensee within 30 days of Licensee's receipt of a written request of Licensor. Supplemental Payments will be paid by the Licensee to the Licensor within (10) days of receipt of said payments by the Licensee from third parties",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of 'all trades conducted through the Licensed Technology,' 'summary quarterly reports,' 'usage of the Licensed Technology,' 'payments made to Licensor,' and 'independent Certified Public Accountant', we introduce a broad, vague requirement for record-keeping and auditing. This change creates an issue if another section specifies payments tied to Licensed Technology usage. Without defined reporting and audit procedures, verifying the accuracy of these payments becomes problematic, creating an internal contradiction and unenforceability.",

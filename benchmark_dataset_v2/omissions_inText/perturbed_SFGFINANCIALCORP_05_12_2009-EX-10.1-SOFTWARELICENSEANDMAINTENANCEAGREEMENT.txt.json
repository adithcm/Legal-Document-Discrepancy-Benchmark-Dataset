                "original_text": "1.5 \"FIELD OF USE\" means, and is limited to, the utilization of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee for the exclusive purpose of  fulfilling Spot FX transactions by transmitting market data and orders. The \"Field of Use\" shall not include any functions or applications  not expressly described in the preceding sentence, but shall include functions or applications developed by Licensor to enhance the  performance within the \"Field of Use\".",

                "explanation": "The original definition specifies 'Spot FX transactions by transmitting market data and orders.' The modified definition simply states 'fulfilling transactions' removes the specificity, while later sections still refer to 'Spot FX' and the transmission of 'market data and orders'. This lack of clarity creates enforcement uncertainty, as it is unclear what types of transactions are included in the 'Field of Use'.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall not' to 'may', and 'under any circumstances' to 'under certain circumstances' creates a contradiction with Article XXIV (c) which states 'Licensee may not assign this Agreement or assign, sublicense and/or transfer in any manner its license rights hereunder in whole or in part without Licensor's prior written consent'.

Subsection II involves 'The conduct of Licensee's business directly or through any affiliate of Licensee', which should also warrant an indemnity. Also, subsection III, by not including this, and a breach of contract occurs, Licensee may be less liable than before. This creates contradiction because the Licensor is assuming greater liability than earlier agreed. ",

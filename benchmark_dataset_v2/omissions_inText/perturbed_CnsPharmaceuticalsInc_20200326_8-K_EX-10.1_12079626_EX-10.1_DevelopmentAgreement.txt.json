                "explanation": "By removing the specific 50% figure and replacing it with 'a percentage', the definition of Development Fee becomes vague. Subsequent clauses that rely on a concrete percentage for calculation purposes will become ambiguous and unenforceable.",

Thereafter, WPD shall furnish to CNS Development Fees no later than forty-five days after the end of each Calendar Quarter for the Sale of Development Products through the end of such Calendar Quarter and shall further furnish CNS with a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'forty-five days' and replacing it with 'reasonable time' introduce ambiguity, and the elimination of providing 'a written statement setting forth an accounting showing the calculation of the Development Fees' removes a required level of granularity from the statement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to Sections 6.1 (a)-(f) of the Sublicense Agreement and substituting it with 'standard deductions,' the method for calculating 'Net Sales' becomes unclear. This creates an inconsistency because other sections reference 'Net Sales' without clearly defining how it's derived beyond this now-vague statement. What is considered a 'standard deduction' is now up for interpretation, creating a possible point of contention.",

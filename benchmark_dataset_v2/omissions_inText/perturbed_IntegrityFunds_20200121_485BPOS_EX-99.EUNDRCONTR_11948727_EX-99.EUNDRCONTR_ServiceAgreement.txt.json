The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive compensation. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by a separate agreement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in that agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the compensation structure by referencing the Fund's Registration Statement and Shareholder Services Plan. By removing this specific reference and replacing it with a vague 'compensation' and 'separate agreement,' the modified text creates uncertainty. Later sections of the contract might still reference the 'Plan' or the method in the Registration Statement, leading to a contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares. Distribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the detailed definition of 'distribution expenses'. Later sections relying on this definition, such as reporting obligations (Section 1.9), will become unclear. The phrase 'subject to further negotiation' introduces ambiguity and potential conflict if other clauses assume a fixed definition. If section 1.9 remains unchanged it now has a contradiction because expenses are no longer defined.",

This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity.

This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific approval requirements by 'Qualified Trustees' and the detailed definition of 'majority' under the 1940 Act introduces ambiguity about the renewal process. If other sections still reference the 'Qualified Trustees' (which are no longer defined) or a specific voting percentage for other decisions, it will create a contradiction. The removal of '(as defined in the 1940 Act)' also eliminates a clear standard for what constitutes a majority.",

Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination,' the modification creates uncertainty. If specific clauses of the 'Original Agreement' like dispute resolution or confidentiality were intended to continue post-termination but are not explicitly mentioned in the termination agreement, this omission could be problematic.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific identification of the 'Original Agreement' and the date of May 8, 2008, the modification introduces ambiguity. Later references to 'the Agreement' in sections 1 may lack clear definition. The parties may dispute about which agreement they intended to terminate.",

                "explanation": "Removing 'complete, integrated and entire' and 'may not be modified except in writing signed by the parties' leads to the agreement becoming open to interpretation of existing outside factors, creating loopholes and opportunities for disputes. It contradicts the spirit of a termination agreement which needs to be a final close.",

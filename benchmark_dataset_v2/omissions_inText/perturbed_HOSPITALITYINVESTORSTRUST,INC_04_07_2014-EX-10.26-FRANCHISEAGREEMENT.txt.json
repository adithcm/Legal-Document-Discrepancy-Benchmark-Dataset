If this Agreement terminates before the Expiration Date, you will pay us Liquidated Damages as follows: 14.4.1.1 If termination occurs before you begin the Hotel Work and before the Opening Date, and you or any Guarantor (or your or any Guarantor's Affiliates) directly or indirectly, enter into a franchise, license, management, lease and/or other similar agreement for or begin construction or commence operation of a hotel, motel, inn, or similar facility at the Hotel Site under a Competitor Brand within one (1) year after termination, then you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $3,600 multiplied by the number of approved Guest Rooms at the Hotel. 14.4.1.2 If termination occurs after you begin the Hotel Work but before the Opening Date, you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $3,600 multiplied by the number of approved Guest Rooms at the Hotel, unless your failure to complete the Hotel Work was the result of Force Majeure.",

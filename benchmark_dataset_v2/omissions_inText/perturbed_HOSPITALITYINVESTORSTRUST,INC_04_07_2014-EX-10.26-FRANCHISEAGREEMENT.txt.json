                "explanation": "By modifying the definition of \"Brand\" from referring to the Addendum to being a 'well-known brand,' introduces ambiguity. Other sections rely on the original definition tied to the Addendum for specifying the exact brand and its associated terms. Now, the definition is vague and creates uncertainty in enforcement as the specific brand (Homewood Suites by Hilton) is not clearly defined here, while other sections implicitly assume it is defined elsewhere. This creates in-text contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By changing the definition of \"Gross Rooms Revenue\" introduces ambiguity. Section 8.2.4 mentions, `In the event of fire or other insured casualty that results in a reduction of Gross Rooms Revenue, you will determine and pay us, from the proceeds of any business interruption or other insurance applicable to loss of revenues, an amount equal to the forecasted Monthly Fees, based on the Gross Rooms Revenue amounts agreed on between you and your insurance company that would have been paid to us in the absence of such casualty.` This creates in-text contradiction since that section still implies some sort of calculation to do with revenues, even though the exact parameters is not specific anymore.",

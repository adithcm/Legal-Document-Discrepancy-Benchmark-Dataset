For purposes of the preceding sentence, King's commercially reasonable efforts shall mean, until [***], at least the same degree of effort (including with respect to the reach and frequency of Details) that King would use for the Promotion of any of King's products that are promoted in the [***], are of a similar market size and patent life, and represent a similar commercial opportunity; thereafter, King will apply the same standard, except that it may fulfill its obligations by Promoting the Product in the [***]. All statements, core selling messages and materials to be utilized by King to Promote the Product shall be consistent in all material respects with the Annual Plan and the Launch Plan. King will cause the King Sales Force and King employees and agents acting on King's behalf to comply with this Agreement and all applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the Promotion of the Product. It is understood, and King agrees, that it will be accountable for the acts or omissions of the King Sales Force and its employees and agents to the extent such acts or omissions fail to comply with King's obligations under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of 'commercially reasonable efforts', the contract now lacks a benchmark for King's promotional activities. This creates ambiguity in enforcement, particularly if Depomed alleges King is not adequately promoting the product. Section 4.3(a), which refers to 'commercially reasonable efforts' becomes open to interpretation, causing legal disputes.",

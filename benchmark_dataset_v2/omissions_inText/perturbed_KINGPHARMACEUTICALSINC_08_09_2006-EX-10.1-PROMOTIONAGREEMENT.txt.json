                "original_text": "Section 1.64 \"Order\" means any award, decision, injunction, judgment, decree, order, ruling, or verdict entered, issued, made, or rendered by any Governmental Authority or by any arbitrator.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.64 \"Order\" means a request made by King to Depomed for promotional materials.",
                "explanation": "By redefining 'Order', the contract introduces ambiguity because later sections refer to 'orders' in the context of regulatory compliance and court orders. This creates uncertainty about whether those sections now refer to requests for promotional materials, which would be illogical and unenforceable.",

In the case of King, Third Parties may only be engaged as Sales Representatives if they are full-time contractors of King, exclusive to King, and carry King's business card.",

                "explanation": "This redefinition creates an inconsistency because several sections discuss Sales Representatives in the context of 'Promoting the Product' in the Territory and their 'training and equipping.' By defining them more broadly, the contract becomes unclear if training and other obligations still apply to Sales Representatives promoting other products, which would be absurd.",

(a) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, as well as the provisions of this Agreement, King shall, from and after the Promotion Commencement Date, at its sole expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to Promote the Product within the Territory in accordance with the Launch Plan or Annual Plan (the \"Promotional Effort\"). For purposes of the preceding sentence, King's commercially reasonable efforts shall mean, until [***], at least the same degree of effort (including with respect to the reach and frequency of Details) that King would use for the Promotion of any of King's products that are promoted in the [***], are of a similar market size and patent life, and represent a similar commercial opportunity; thereafter, King will apply the same standard, except that it may fulfill its obligations by Promoting the Product in the [***].",

The original text specifies a 'renewable one-year term' and ties it to the 'Maintenance Commencement Date', linking it to the 'Fee Schedule'.

If Sparkling terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 17(b), Sparkling shall cease using the Software at the end of the ninety (90) day notice period, and shall certify to Garman within thirty (30) calendar days of termination that Sparkling has destroyed or has returned to Garman all Software, Documentation and Codes.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates a 90-day written notice for termination by Sparkling and a 30-day period post-termination for returning materials. The changed text eliminates the notice period and the specific timeframe for returning materials, replacing it with immediate cessation and a vague 'good faith effort'. This creates conflict, as elsewhere the 90 days might still be referenced regarding early termination penalties.",

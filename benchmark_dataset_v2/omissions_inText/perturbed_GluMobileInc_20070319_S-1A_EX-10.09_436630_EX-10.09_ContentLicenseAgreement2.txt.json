At such time that ***** percent (*****%) of the Guarantee Forfeiture Payment is recouped by Licensee, Fox shall earn and Licensee shall pay to Fox Royalties at the rate of ***** percent (*****%) of Licensee's gross receipts from Licensee's sale, license, distribution or other exploitation of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product.",
                "changed_text": "Licensee may recoup a certain amount from the sales of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product. At such time that a certain percentage is recouped by Licensee, Fox shall earn and Licensee shall pay to Fox Royalties at a rate of Licensee's gross receipts from Licensee's sale, license, distribution or other exploitation of the IN HER SHOES Wireless Product.",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment (as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Amendment below)' was removed, creating ambiguity on the amount that the Licensee can recoup. Removing 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment' definition makes the term vague and unenforceable, creating an internal contradiction because Paragraph 3 defines this, but Paragraph 2 references it without the definition. Also, the specific percentages that should be recouped by licensee, earned and paid to fox have been removed. The use of 'a certain amount,' 'a certain percentage' and 'a rate of' without any specifics create a degree of uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the previous perturbation, the specific reference to 'Guarantee Forfeiture Payment (as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Amendment below)' has been omitted and the percentage amounts to be recouped by the Licensee and paid to fox has been omitted. This omission introduces ambiguity and contradicts the intention to have the amount clearly defined elsewhere in the contract.

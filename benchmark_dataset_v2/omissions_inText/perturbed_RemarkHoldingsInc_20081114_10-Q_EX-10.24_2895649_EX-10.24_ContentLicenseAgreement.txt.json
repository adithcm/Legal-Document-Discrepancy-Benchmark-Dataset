                "explanation": "The original text specifies a maximum percentage for cost deductions, providing a clear limit. The modified text removes this limit, giving HSWI broad discretion over cost deductions, potentially contradicting the intention of a fair revenue split, especially if another section relies on the original definition for royalty calculations.",

If any dispute arises under this Agreement that is not settled promptly in the ordinary course of business, the Parties shall seek to resolve any such dispute between them; first, by negotiating promptly with each other in face-to-face negotiations. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement or breach of this Agreement that cannot be resolved within fifteen (15) business days (or such period as the Parties shall otherwise agree) through face-to-face negotiations shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator mutually acceptable to the parties and experienced in the matters at issue and selected by the Parties in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single arbitrator, each party shall select an arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator. The arbitration shall only be held in New York, New York. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter or either of the Parties, except that each party reserves all rights of appeal. The arbitrator(s) shall determine to what extent each of the Parties shall bear the costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) on the basis of the arbitrator's assessment of the relative merits of the Parties' positions.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates binding arbitration under specific rules and procedures, including location and arbitrator selection. The modified text removes these specifics, stating parties 'may pursue resolution through means they deem appropriate,' thus contradicting any assumptions in other sections about the mandatory arbitration process. This creates uncertainty on how disputes will be handled, particularly if other clauses rely on the arbitration clause for enforcement.",

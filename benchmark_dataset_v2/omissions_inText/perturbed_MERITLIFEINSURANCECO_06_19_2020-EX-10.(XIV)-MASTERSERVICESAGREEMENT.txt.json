                "explanation": "By removing 'and the parties subsequently may agree in writing that additional individuals are Key Personnel for such engagement. Company shall have the right to interview and approve such additional personnel at Company's request.' we create a situation where additional Key Personnel can be added without company approval, but the document still refers to the process for reassigning dissatisfied personnel implying the company has some control over personnel assignment.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'Contractor will be compensated on a time and materials.', the agreement now lacks clear guidance on the primary method of compensation. While the Statement of Work is referenced, removing the explicit 'time and materials' leaves the payment structure ambiguous. The lack of specific calculation in section 3 directly contradicts the description in section 1(a) where 'Contractor's compensation' is described as part of 'Statement of Work' details, creating uncertainty around compensation enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and any third party products' from section 5(c), contractor's warranty doesn't cover third party product infringements. Section 1(f) states 'To the extent Contractor provides any third party materials and products Contractor acknowledges that it shall be solely responsible for ensuring the functionality and specifications of such third party materials and products used in performing Services under this Agreement.' Which contradicts that this section doesn't cover third party products. The company would assume the contractor needs to be responsible for potential 3rd party product infringements.",

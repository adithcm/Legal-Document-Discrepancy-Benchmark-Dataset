                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Company agrees to compensate Contractor as set forth in each Statement of Work. Contractor will be compensated on a time and materials. In addition, Company shall reimburse Contractor its actual out-of-pocket expenses as reasonably incurred by Contractor in connection with its performance of the Services as negotiated in each Statement of Work.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Company agrees to compensate Contractor as generally agreed upon. In addition, Company shall reimburse Contractor its actual out-of-pocket expenses.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies compensation as being defined in each Statement of Work, based on 'time and materials'. The modified clause removes the reference to the Statement of Work and 'time and materials', creating ambiguity. This contradicts the later clauses which refer to specifics of the 'Statement of Work' agreements. It is now unclear how the Contractor will be compensated, making enforcement difficult. In addition, it is unclear the amount to be paid for expenses, and what expenses are covered. In the next sections there is reference to invoices, which are now unclear on what terms they should be done.",

In all instances of a conflict, between the provisions of this Agreement and the specific provisions set forth in a Statement of Work, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.",
                "changed_text": "Statements of Work that are from time to time agreed upon shall reference this Agreement, and shall be executed by the parties. In instances of conflict, between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions set forth in a Statement of Work, the Statement of Work will control.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that the 'Master Service Agreement' shall control in any instance of conflict with the 'Statement of Work', in order to prioritize the overall governance of the agreement. The modified clause is directly contradictory, as now it is the 'Statement of Work' that supersedes any conflict within the Master Service Agreement. The change creates an enforcement problem, as it is unclear if the Master Service Agreement is enforceable. The Master Service Agreement references earlier clauses such as compensation in Section 3(a), but it now will depend on the Statement of Work, if there is a conflict.",

Contractor agrees to render, at Company's sole cost and expense, all reasonably required assistance to Company to protect the rights herein above described, including executing other documents as requested by Company.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the critical link to 'Statement of Work', but there are still references to the 'Statement of Work' in other sections. This will lead to ambiguity, as the ownership of 'Works' is now unclear of what is actually owned, since it is no longer a work product of the 'Statement of Work'.",

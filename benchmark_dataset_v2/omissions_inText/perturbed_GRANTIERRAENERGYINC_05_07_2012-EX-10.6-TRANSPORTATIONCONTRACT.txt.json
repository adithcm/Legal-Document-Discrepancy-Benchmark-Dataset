If this is not possible, the penal pecuniary clause shall be collected by means of execution for  which the Contract shall be a writ of execution.\n\n    12.3 The application of the penal pecuniary clause does not include the indemnification for any damages borne by the SENDER if the amounts of  these are higher, under the criteria of ECOPETROL, to the amount of the penal pecuniary clause agreed hereof, nor it releases the SENDER from its  payment obligation of the totality of the value of the Contract pursuant to the conditions agreed.",

The specific amount for the penalties is established in the Manual of the Shipper (Annex 1).\n\n    12.2 Said sum shall be charged to the amount of damage suffered by ECOPETROL, and its value may be taken directly from the balance in favor of  the SENDER if there is any, or else from the Bond.

                "explanation": "The original contract defines the penalty as 10% of the final contract value. The revised clause refers to Annex 1 (Manual of the Shipper) for the amount. However, the Manual of the Shipper does not specify the penalty amount, creating a contradiction. This makes enforcement uncertain because the contract references a specific amount (removed) and directs the reader to another document where the amount is not specified.",

                "explanation": "The key contractual term 'Surcharges, bonuses and discounts' has a very ambiguous modification. By using the word 'may', uncertainty is introduced. The original language has been weakened, but the exact implications are unclear. This will affect the fees and payment clause.",

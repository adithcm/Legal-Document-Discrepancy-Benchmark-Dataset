However, Section 8(a) still discusses the 'Support Period' implying a limited warranty, creating a contradiction as to the duration of obligations.",

The Client may not declare a breach, and the Developer cannot be held in breach of this Agreement, of this section if such delay is caused by an action or failure of action of the Client. In such case, the Developer will provide the Client with written notice of the delay and work on the Application System will work until the reason for the delay has been resolved by the Client and written notice of that resolution has been provided to the Developer.",

Other sections mention milestones, which can be interpreted as a form of payment conditional, which directly contradicts section G.",

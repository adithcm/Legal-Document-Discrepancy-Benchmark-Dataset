                "original_text": "3. TERM. This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement, will continue until the expiration of the Warranty Period as defined in subsection 9(a) of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original contract explicitly links the term to the 'Warranty Period' defined in Section 9(a). By changing the term to 'continue indefinitely', the contract creates a contradiction. Section 8(a) and Exhibit E will reference a defined Support Period/warranty, but the main contract now suggests no fixed end date tied to it, creating confusion about the agreement's duration and warranty obligations. This also contradicts the specifications for maintenance & support in exhibit E.",

The Developer hereby warrants and represents that following delivery of the Application System to the Client (which shall be deeded to occur only on the date the Web Application is uploaded to the AWS for distribution) pursuant to Exhibit A (the \"Support Period\"), the Application will be free from programming errors and defects in workmanship and materials, and will conform to the specifications of Exhibit A. If programming errors or other defects are discovered during the Support Period, the Developer shall promptly remedy those errors or defects at its own expense. The developer will fix any bugs that may come up from the original contract after the 90 days warranty has passed.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to the 'Support Period', the contract now implies an unlimited warranty period, which contradicts Exhibit E that specifies a '90 days warranty (bugfixing) support is included'. The term 'Support Period' is undefined which makes the warranty obligations vague and unenforceable.",

The Developer recognizes and agrees that failure to deliver the Application in accordance with the delivery schedule detailed in Exhibit A to this Agreement will result in expense and damage to the Client. The Developer shall inform the Client immediately of any anticipated delays in the delivery schedule and of any remedial actions being taken to ensure completion of the Application System according to such schedule. If a delivery date is missed, the Client may, in its sole discretion, declare such delay a material breach of the Agreement under subsection 4(a) and pursue all of its legal and equitable remedies. The Client may not declare a breach, and the Developer cannot be held in breach of this Agreement, of this section if such delay is caused by an action or failure of action of the Client. In such case, the Developer will provide the Client with written notice of the delay and work on the Application System will work until the reason for the delay has been resolved by the Client and written notice of that resolution has been provided to the Developer.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to 'delivery schedule detailed in Exhibit A', the contract language is made vague and subjective. Exhibit D still contains a 'Completion Schedule' with specific timelines. The modified text introduces an internal contradiction, as it suggests the delivery schedule is important, yet removes the objective measure for evaluating delays. It also makes the reference to the delivery schedule in exhibit A invalid, because it is no longer being enforced. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as 'project expectations' are not clearly defined.",

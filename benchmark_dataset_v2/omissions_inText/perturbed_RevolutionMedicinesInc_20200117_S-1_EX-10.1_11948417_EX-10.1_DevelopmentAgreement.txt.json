The modified text removes these specific purposes and regulatory consistencies creating ambiguity. Further, removing the exclusion of investigator-initiated Clinical Trials, but then omitting the caveat of needing JRDC approval creates uncertainty as other sections may reference JRDC oversight of trials.",

The modified version provides a general 'reasonable company' standard, but removes what 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' means for each party, thus creating ambiguity. If another section still requires using Commercially Reasonable Efforts as per the original definition, it becomes difficult to enforce because that original definition is missing.",

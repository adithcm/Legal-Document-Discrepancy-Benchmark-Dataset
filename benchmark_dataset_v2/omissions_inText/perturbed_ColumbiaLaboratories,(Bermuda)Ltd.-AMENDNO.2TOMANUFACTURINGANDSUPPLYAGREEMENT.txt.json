All right, title and interest in and to the Raw Materials provided by Columbia (including but not limited to the [***] and the [***]) shall remain with Columbia at all times. Fleet shall ensure that all Raw Materials are released for use at least [***] prior to their use in manufacturing the Product. Fleet shall maintain sufficient stocks of Raw Materials to meet its manufacturing and supply obligations to, and as set out in any Production Schedule by, Columbia; provided however that Fleet shall have a retest date in accordance with the relevant supplier's written instructions (or where none, Fleet's SOPs, which Fleet shall provide to Columbia upon request) for Raw Materials. Raw Materials shall not be used beyond their expiration date as provided by the Raw Materials supplier.\n\n(i) [***] costs of Raw Materials shall be included in the Purchase Price. Fleet shall be responsible for [***] of Raw Materials hereunder which Fleet supplies. For the avoidance of doubt, Columbia shall be responsible for all such costs only in respect of [***] and [***] provided by Columbia to Fleet. Fleet shall not use any Raw Materials purchased directly by Columbia except for the manufacture of Product hereunder. Columbia will be responsible for all retesting costs associated with the Raw Materials supplied by Columbia.\n\n(ii) Fleet shall notify Columbia of any Raw Materials that do not meet the specifications of the Raw Materials, and shall provide Columbia with full details within twenty-four (24) hours of completion of the investigation, but not more than twenty (20) business days from identification of the non-conformity with the specifications.",

                "explanation": "The original section defined the responsibilities for raw materials, including ordering, ownership, retesting, and notification of non-conformities. The modified section eliminates key details about who is responsible for ordering which materials and the specific timelines for reporting non-conformities. By removing the specific responsibilities for raw materials (especially around who orders what), the contract becomes vague. This directly contradicts the intent of having clear responsibilities, which introduces an internal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The omission removes the detailed process for production schedules, including the firm purchase order commitment for certain periods and the non-binding estimates for others.

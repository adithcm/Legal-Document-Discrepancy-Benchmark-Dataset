                "explanation": "By changing 'written Production Schedule' to 'Production Schedule' and 'firm purchase order' to 'non-binding forecast,' and 'Fleet shall manufacture, supply and deliver to Columbia all quantities of Product as Columbia orders' to 'Fleet shall endeavor to supply and deliver to Columbia all quantities of Product as Columbia forecasts' introduces ambiguity and contradictions in the obligations. The contract now references a 'Production Schedule' without explicitly requiring a written document. It also changes the firm nature of a purchase order. This contradicts the subsequent clauses that rely on a clear and defined Production Schedule and Purchase Order system. It weakens the enforcement of supply obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Columbia shall have the right to terminate this Agreement' to 'Columbia may consider terminating this Agreement if' significantly weakens Columbia's termination rights. The original text provided clear termination events, whereas the revised text only allows Columbia to consider termination when certain events arise. This contradicts the purpose of a termination clause, which should provide defined circumstances for ending the agreement. In addition, the original text stated 'Fleet fails to maintain its authorizations', whereas the changed text states 'Fleet's authorizations under Applicable law to manufacture the product are under review'. The original text stated 'Fleet cannot supply product at a Competitive Price', whereas the changed text states 'Fleet indicates an inability to supply product at a Competitive Price'. The original text stated 'the Ares Agreement is terminated', whereas the changed text states 'the Ares Agreement is under negotiation'. All of these contradict the clear termination events, since Fleet's authorization may resume, the Ares Agreement may continue and/or Fleet may eventually offer Competitive Price for the product.",

                "explanation": "By removing  '3A.2, 3A.3 and 3A.8 (Machinery and Equipment)' and '9 (Adverse Events; Recalls)' from the list of surviving sections, the contract creates inconsistencies. These sections relate to the ownership, use, and maintenance of Columbia's equipment located at Fleet's facility, and adverse event/recall obligations. If these sections do not survive termination, it's unclear what happens to Columbia's equipment and/or if Fleet is liable for adverse events/recalls after the contract ends. This omission contradicts other sections that may assume the continued applicability of these provisions post-termination, leading to disputes over ownership and responsibility.",

Fleet shall manufacture, supply and deliver to Columbia all quantities of Product as Columbia orders in accordance with this Section 3.1. All right, title and interest in and to the Product shall remain with Columbia at all times. Fleet shall ensure that it has sufficient experienced production staff available to meet the requirements set out in each Production Schedule and at a minimum, to meet the expected non-binding forecast set out below: [***] [***] [***] [***] [***] [***] N u m b e r o f batches [***] [***] [***] [***] [***] [***] (b) Non-Active Product Orders. From time to time during the Term, Columbia may provide Fleet with a purchase order for a batch of Product that does not contain any active pharmaceutical ingredient provided that such purchase order is received at least ninety (90) days prior to the required delivery date. The batch size for any Product ordered pursuant to this Section 3.1 (b) shall be set out in the relevant purchase order. All provisions of this Agreement that relate to Products shall apply equally to any Products that do not contain any active pharmaceutical ingredient.\"",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific terms such as firm purchase order and binding upon Columbia and also the specific clauses regarding staffing and batches, the modified text introduces ambiguity regarding the nature of Purchase Orders and the level of Fleet's commitment. The original Section 3.1 defines amounts that are binding and non-binding. The changed Section 3.1 (a) removes that definition. This means the section now contradicts itself, because it does not define the terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines GMPs with reference to FDA regulations and ISO 13485. The modified text removes these specific references, creating ambiguity about the exact standards Establishment must adhere to. If later sections reference compliance with 'cGMPs,' it is unclear which standards are being referenced.",

APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications. Upon confirmation of defective condition by ESTABLISHMENT and issuance of a return material authorization (\"RMA\") number, APOLLO shall be entitled to the immediate return and replacement, free of charge, of any Product supplied by ESTABLISHMENT in breach of any warranty under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day inspection window and the criteria for rejection (failure to meet specifications). It also mandates immediate return and replacement upon confirmation of defects. The modified text removes the 30-day inspection window and the immediate return and replacement clause, creating uncertainty about the timelines and remedies for defective products. Later mentions of warranty claims are thus harder to enforce due to the lack of procedural details.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a written Quality Agreement attached as Exhibit B. The modified version removes this explicit requirement, and only requires complying with a general concept. This omission creates an in-text contradiction if other sections of the contract rely on the existence of a well-defined Quality Agreement, such as audit procedures or specification change protocols, as Exhibit B defines specific Quality standards. Now it becomes ambiguous.",

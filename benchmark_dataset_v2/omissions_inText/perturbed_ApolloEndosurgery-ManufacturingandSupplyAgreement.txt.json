                "explanation": "By removing FDA compliance requirements and only keeping ISO 13485 compliance requirements, it creates uncertainty in enforcement because the contract in other sections might refer to FDA regulatory requirements for manufacturing medical devices, which ESTABLISHMENT is no longer explicitly bound to under this definition.",

APOLLO shall deliver to ESTABLISHMENT a forecast for anticipated monthly deliveries of Product to APOLLO over the subsequent four (4) calendar quarters (the \"Forecast\"). The Forecast is to be used by the Parties for planning purposes and is not a commitment by APOLLO to purchase the quantities of Products specified in such Forecast, except as described below.\n\nThe quantities of Product forecasted for the initial three (3) months of each updated rolling Forecast shall represent a binding obligation of Apollo to purchase from ESTABLISHMENT, and of ESTABLISHMENT to manufacture and supply to APOLLO, such quantities of Product.\n\nESTABLISHMENT shall, at all times during the Term, maintain an inventory of raw materials and components sufficient to manufacture the binding obligations.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that states the initial three months of each forecast are a binding obligation, this creates contradiction when ESTABLISHMENT is still required to maintain enough raw materials to meet binding obligations. The removal makes enforcement ambigious because there are no explicitly defined binding obligations.",

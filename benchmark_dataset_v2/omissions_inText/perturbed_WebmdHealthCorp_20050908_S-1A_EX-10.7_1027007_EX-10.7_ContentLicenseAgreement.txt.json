                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit A in Section 1(a), but still retaining references to 'Content' elsewhere, the agreement now lacks a clear definition of what constitutes 'Content.' Also removing 'verbatim or as source material' creates uncertainty around what Emdeon is allowed to do with the material. Changing 'may not change' to 'may alter' creates an internal contradiction in the agreement regarding the degree to which Emdeon can modify the content.",

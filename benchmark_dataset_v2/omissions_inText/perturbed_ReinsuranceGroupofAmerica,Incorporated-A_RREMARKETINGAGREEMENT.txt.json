Subsequent sections refer to and rely on the 'Remarketing Procedures,' but there is no clear, contractually defined meaning after this omission. The ambiguity regarding what constitutes the 'Remarketing Procedures' makes enforcement uncertain.",

The reference to 'industry standards' lacks a specific, agreed-upon definition or calculation methodology within the contract, making the actual fee amount unclear and potentially subject to disputes.

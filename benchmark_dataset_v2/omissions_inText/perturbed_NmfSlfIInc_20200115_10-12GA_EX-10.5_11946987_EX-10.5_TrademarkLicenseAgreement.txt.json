                "explanation": "By replacing the detailed description of 'Licensed Services' with 'certain services', the agreement becomes vague. Later clauses relying on the specific definition now lack clarity. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of the license and what constitutes permissible use.",

Removing the reasonable time frame of 'not to exceed sixty (60) days' for the Licensee to cure the problem after written notification, creates an internal contradiction. What is deemed 'reasonable'?

If the investment advisor is a beneficiary, but it doesn't have any rights, is it actually a beneficiary? This undermines the stated intention and may weaken their legal standing.",

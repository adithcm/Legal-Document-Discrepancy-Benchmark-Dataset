In consideration for providing these Services, MKOS shall pay UTEK $120,000 in the form of unregistered shares of common stock (923,077 shares) upon the execution of this Strategic Alliance Agreement. 1/12th of the shares (76,923) shall vest each month during the term of this Agreement. In lieu of payment of shares, MKOS shall have the option of paying UTEK $10,000 per month for the Services described in this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated any unvested shares will be returned to MKOS.",
                "changed_text": "A. In consideration for providing these Services, MKOS shall compensate UTEK as agreed upon in a separate addendum. If this Agreement is terminated any unvested shares will be returned to MKOS.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the initial compensation structure, including the amount and form of payment. The modified text refers to compensation being detailed in a 'separate addendum,' but no addendum is present, creating uncertainty regarding the primary form of compensation. The agreement mentions 'unvested shares' without explicitly defining their existence or quantity within the main body of the agreement, thus contradicting the assumption that such shares exist.",

The benefits of the Agreement shall inure to the respective successors and assignees of the parties and assigns and representatives, and the obligations and liabilities assumed in this Agreement by the parties hereto shall be binding upon their respective successors and assigns; provided that the rights and obligations of UTEK under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of MKOS and any such purported assignment shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, UTEK may assign this Agreement or any portion of its Compensation as outlined herein to its subsidiaries in its sole discretion.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, UTEK may assign this Agreement or any portion of its rights as outlined herein to its subsidiaries in its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Compensation' to 'rights', the modified text introduces ambiguity. The original clause permits UTEK to assign compensation to its subsidiaries, which is clear. The modified clause uses 'rights,' which is broader and may include obligations or other rights under the contract that were originally intended to remain with UTEK, leading to uncertainty about the scope of permissible assignment. The prior sentence restricts assignment without consent, but the subsequent sentence creates a contradiction because 'rights' is too broad and ill-defined.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifically mentions that Indemnification Provisions shall remain in effect after termination of the agreement. The modified text removes the specific mention of 'Indemnification Provisions,' but does not specify other provisions that would remain in effect which brings into questions which provisions still remain valid. This omission introduces uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the indemnification clause after termination, which is critical. Also this change is in direct conflict with the indemnity sections detailed previously, creating further ambiguity.",

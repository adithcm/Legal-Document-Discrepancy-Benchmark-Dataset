                "explanation": "The original definition clause clearly links the meaning of capitalized terms in the Amendment to the Global Maintenance Agreement (GMA). The modified clause removes this link, suggesting terms should be interpreted based on 'general business usage' instead. This creates a contradiction if specific terms have defined meanings within the GMA, as referenced in later sections.",

GOVERNING LAW - ARBITRATION\n\n5.1 Governing law:\n\nPursuant to and in accordance with Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, the Parties hereto agree that this Amendment in all respects, and any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this Amendment, or any dealing between the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company/Repairer relationship being established, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. as applied to contracts to be performed wholly within the State of New York (Exclusive of Section 7-101 of the New York General Obligations Law which is inapplicable to this Amendment).\n\n5.2 Arbitration: in the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to this Amendment, including without limitation disputes regarding the existence, validity or termination of this Amendment (a \"Dispute\"), either Party may notify such Dispute to the other through service of a written notice (the \"Notice of Dispute\"). The Parties shall make their reasonable endeavours to settle the Dispute amicably by a committee composed of one (1) management representative of each Party (the \"Representatives\"). Such committee shall be created by the Parties within [*****] from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Subject to sub-Clause 5.2.5 below and in the event the Representatives (i) fail to create such committee or (ii) do not agree on an amicable settlement within [*****] from the date the committee referred to in this sub-Clause 5.2 has been created or such longer period as may be agreed upon in writing by the Representatives (the \"Amicable Settlement Period\"), the Dispute shall be exclusively and finally settled under the Rules and Conciliation of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the \"ICC\") by an arbitral tribunal composed of three (3) arbitrators; each Party shall then appoint one (1) arbitrator within [*****]from the last day of the Amicable Settlement Period and the third arbitrator, who will act as President, will be appointed by the other two (2) arbitrators. In case the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the Parties do not agree on this choice with [*****] from the date the last arbitrator is appointed, the third arbitrator will be appointed by the ICC Court.",

GOVERNING LAW - ARBITRATION\n\n5.1 Governing law:\n\nThis Amendment shall be governed by the laws of the state where Azul's main office is located.\n\n5.2 Arbitration: All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules of UNCITRAL.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies New York law and ICC arbitration. The modified clause changes the governing law to 'Azul's main office location' which introduces ambiguity if not specifically defined within the document, and also switches the arbitration to UNCITRAL rules. This contradicts the clearly defined New York law and ICC arbitration of the original clause. The specific details of the arbitration process defined in the original 5.2.1 are also removed, creating further inconsistency.",

CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n4.1 Confidentiality obligations\n\nUnless otherwise provided in this Amendment, any Confidential Information released by either of the Parties (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall not be released in whole or in part to any third party.\n\nIn particular, the Receiving Party undertakes:\n\n- to keep the Confidential Information strictly confidential, not to deliver, disclose or publish it to any third party including subsidiarycompanies and companies having an interest in its capital, except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Disclosing Party;\n\n- to use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of this Amendment and except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing bythe Disclosing Party, not to use the same or permit its use for any other purpose;\n\n\n\n- to disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its direct employees having a need to know such Confidential Information in order to make permitted use thereof, after having beforehand clearly informed such employees of the strictly confidential nature of the Confidential Information and caused them to observe said conditions of confidentiality. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for the correct performance of said obligations of confidentiality by its employees and shall keep up to date the list of its personnel, to whom Confidential Information is communicated, which list shall be made available to the Disclosing Party at its request;\n\n- not to duplicate the Confidential Information nor to copy or reproduce the same beyond the purpose of the Amendment;\n\n- not to disclose Confidential Information to any third party, unless such third party is acting at the instruction of the Receiving Party and such disclosure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the Amendment, provided however, that prior to any such disclosure both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n(i) each of such third parties, shall have signed an acknowledgement to keep such Confidential Information as strictly confidential;and,\n\n(ii) the Receiving Party shall have obtained written prior approval of the Disclosing Party of such proposed disclosure, whichapproval may be not unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\n- promptly notify the Disclosing Party if a disclosure of Confidential Information is required by a Government Entity or by Law and to useall reasonable effort to assist the Disclosing Party in limiting such disclosure to the extent permitted by Law;\n\n- upon discovery of any disclosure of Confidential Information, regardless of whether such discovery is intentional or inadvertent, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party and take all reasonable actions (i) to retrieve the disclosed Confidential Information, (ii) to destroy any unauthorized copies thereof and (iii) to stop further disclosure.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause outlines very specific obligations regarding the use, disclosure, and protection of Confidential Information. The modified clause drastically simplifies these obligations, only mentioning the general requirement to keep information confidential and allowing disclosure when required by law or court order. The deletion of the detailed obligations creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract still reference the expectation of adherence to the original, more comprehensive confidentiality provisions, especially concerning subsidiaries or subcontractors.",

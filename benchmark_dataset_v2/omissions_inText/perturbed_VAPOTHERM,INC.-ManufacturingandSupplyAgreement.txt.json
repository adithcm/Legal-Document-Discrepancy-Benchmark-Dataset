                "explanation": "By changing Medica's obligation to manufacture based on Medica's internal capacity instead of Vapotherm's orders, it creates a contradiction as Article 2 and 3 still refer to Vapotherm's forecasts and purchase orders. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as Medica may not fulfill Vapotherm's order if it exceeds Medica's capacity, even if Vapotherm follows the forecasting and ordering procedures outlined in the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By changing the price determination to Medica's discretion and removing Exhibit A-1, this contradicts sections that assume a fixed or negotiated price based on a schedule.

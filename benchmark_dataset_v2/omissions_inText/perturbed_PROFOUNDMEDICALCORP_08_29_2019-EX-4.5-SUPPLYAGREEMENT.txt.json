                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Schedule 1 and the Quality Agreement, the definition of 'Specifications' becomes vague. Other clauses rely on 'Specifications' being clearly defined and linked to specific documents. Without this, it's unclear which specifications Philips must adhere to, creating uncertainty in enforcement and potentially contradicting sections on product conformity.",

The purchase price for the Product includes the costs of packaging as defined in the DMR, but any additional costs resulting from compliance with non-standard packaging specifications (i.e., different from as defined in the DMR) shall be added to the Price.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to Customer's instructions within the Device Master Record (DMR) and Quality Agreement creates ambiguity. It contradicts potential sections outlining Customer's right to specify packaging or shipping requirements. The new text implies Philips has sole discretion using 'standard industry practices,' potentially conflicting with clauses giving Customer control over product specifications.",

The Transition Plan shall be negotiated based on the key transition terms outlined in Schedule 5 hereto (the \"Transition Plan Term Sheet\"). In connection with the negotiation and ultimately implementation of the Transition Plan, Parties shall install a project team which: (a) shall have a manager (\"Project Manager\"), one from Philips, who has experience in transferring manufacturing actives, and one from Customer, who has experience in setting up manufacturing activities; (b) shall be committed with sufficient capacity - made available by both Parties - to execute the Transition Plan within the given time frame (quantity), and the Parties shall ensure that sufficient and reasonable organizational resources are provided to each such Project Manager to ensure a smooth, uninterrupted and efficient transition of the manufacturing of the Product; (c) shall be sufficiently skilled and experienced with the activities under this Agreement (quality); (d) shall be fully dedicated to the timely and adequate execution of the Transition Plan.",

                "explanation": "Removing the detail about the Transition Plan, negotiation timelines, Schedule 5 reference, and the project team's specific requirements creates a contradiction. Other sections might refer to specific deliverables or roles defined in the Transition Plan and the Project Team structure. Without these elements, those clauses become unenforceable and the agreement lacks a concrete framework for transitioning manufacturing, leading to potential disputes.",

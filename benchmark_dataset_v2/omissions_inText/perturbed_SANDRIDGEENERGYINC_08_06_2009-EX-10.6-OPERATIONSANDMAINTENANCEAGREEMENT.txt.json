                "explanation": "By changing 'shall comply in all respects' to 'shall endeavor to comply', the contract creates ambiguity. If Section 4.2 (Standard of Care) continues to state that Operator must perform duties in accordance with all valid and applicable Environmental Laws, a contradiction arises. It is now unclear if Operator is legally obligated to full compliance or only obligated to make an effort. This affects enforcement.",

Operator shall maintain statutory worker's compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates' employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of subrogation against Owner. (b) Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this Agreement including, without limitation, bodily injury, death, property damage, independent contractors, products/completed operations, contractual, and personal injury liability, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the annual aggregate. (c) Commercial Automobile Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial Automobile Insurance coverage, including, without limitation, bodily injury and property damage for owned, hired, rented, and non-owned automotive equipment with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per accident. (d) Umbrella Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Umbrella Liability Insurance coverage covering in excess of (a), (b), and (c) above, excluding Worker's Compensation, in the amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000).",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific insurance coverage details (Workers' Compensation, Commercial General Liability, Commercial Automobile, and Umbrella Liability Insurance) and replacing them with a general statement, the contract now lacks clarity. If sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 still reference these specific types of insurance, an inconsistency is created. The original clause defines precise requirements. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by deferring those specifics to a future agreement. This makes enforcement difficult because the required coverage is not clearly defined in the initial agreement.",

Upon reasonable prior written notice to Operator, Owner shall have the right during normal business hours to audit or examine all books and records of Operator to the extent they relate to Operator's performance hereunder as well as the relevant books of account of Operator's contractors, relating to the performance of Operator's obligations under this Agreement. Operator shall cooperate with Owner's auditors by (i) making the applicable books and records available for inspection by Owner's auditors, and (ii) making such copies of books and records as may be reasonably requested by such auditors. In no event shall Owner's audits unreasonably interfere with Operator's operations. Owner will be responsible for all costs of any such audit; provided that if, in any audit, Owner discovers overpayments by Owner of at least $250,000 in the aggregate (\"Material Overpayment\"), Operator will reimburse Owner for such Material Overpayment and all reasonable costs incurred by Owner in connection with such audit (\"Audit Costs\"). Owner shall have up until two years after the close of a Calendar Year in which to make an audit of Operator's records for such Calendar Year. Except for any bill or statement with respect to which an Adjustment Claim is made within the two-year audit period, the bills and statements rendered for the Calendar Year prior to such two-year audit period shall be conclusively established as correct. An \"Adjustment Claim\" shall mean a written claim by Owner to Operator requesting a refund or other financial adjustment in respect of any overpayment by Owner (including in the case of a Material Overpayment, all Audit Costs) and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. Operator shall, within 10 days of receipt of an Adjustment Claim, provide Owner with the requested refund or other financial adjustment; provided that if Operator shall dispute in good faith some or all of the amounts set forth in such Adjustment Claim, Operator may elect to withhold any disputed amounts, pending resolution of the dispute. If the Parties shall fail to resolve their dispute with respect to the remaining Adjustment Claim amount within 15 Business Days, Owner may, at its sole option, refer such dispute for resolution in accordance with the terms of Section 9.6. Unless otherwise resolved by the Parties, any bill or statement that is the subject of an Adjustment Claim shall be conclusively established as correct if dispute resolution procedures have not been initiated under Section 9.6 of this Agreement within 180 days of the submission of an Adjustment Claim. Any and all information pertaining to Operator and its business that is disclosed to Owner or discovered by Owner in connection with any audit hereunder shall be subject to the Confidentiality and Disclosure Agreement without regard to whether it has been designated as such and Owner shall be subject to the same restrictions and standard of care set forth therein with respect to Operator's confidential information.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definitions of 'Material Overpayment', 'Audit Costs', 'Adjustment Claim', and the detailed procedure for handling overpayments discovered during audits, the contract now has internal inconsistencies. If Section 5.2 (Procedure for Reimbursement) refers to 'Adjustment Claims' or 'Audit Costs', a contradiction arises. It is now unclear how overpayments are to be handled, what constitutes a material overpayment, and what rights the owner has to recoup audit costs. This ambiguity makes enforcement problematic.",

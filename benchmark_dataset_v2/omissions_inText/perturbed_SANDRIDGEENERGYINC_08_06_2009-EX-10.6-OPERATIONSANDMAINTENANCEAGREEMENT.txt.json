Owner agrees to promptly notify Operator after any such netting, set-off or application is made; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such netting, set-off or application.",

                "explanation": "By changing \"Owner is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to net, set-off and apply any payments owing to Owner against any and all of the obligations of any Operator Party under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.\" to \"Owner may consider, subject to mutual agreement with Operator, netting payments owed to it against Operator's obligations under this Agreement.\" introduces ambiguity. Previously, Owner had the explicit right to set off payments unilaterally. Now, it's subject to mutual agreement, but 5.3.1 says it shall be calculated without reference to any netting, set-off.",

Operator shall (i) administer and otherwise comply with the budget process set forth in  Section 6.6 of the Gathering Agreement and (ii) operate and maintain the Gathering System in compliance with the Proposed Operating Expense  Budget established for the Gathering System; provided, however, if Owner instructs Operator to perform any services outside of the scope of  the services contemplated in the Proposed Operating Expense Budget, then Owner shall reimburse Operator for the costs and expenses  associated therewith.",

If Owner requests Operator to perform services significantly beyond typical operational scope, reimbursement will be discussed and agreed upon separately.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates compliance with a defined 'Proposed Operating Expense Budget' process and compliance. The modified version replaces this with a vaguer 'reasonable consideration given to budgetary guidelines.' This introduces uncertainty because while the agreement references budgetary constraints, the concrete requirement to adhere to the 'Proposed Operating Expense Budget' is removed, making the financial control mechanism less enforceable and contradict the intention to have a firm budget in place.",

Operator shall maintain statutory worker's compensation insurance, covering all of its and its Affiliates'  employees and statutory employees, in accordance with the benefits afforded by the statutory Worker's Compensation Acts applicable  to the state, territory, or district of hire, supervision, or place of accident. In addition, Operator shall maintain employer's liability  insurance with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease each  employee, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) disease policy limit. Where not prohibited by law, Operator shall waive its right of  subrogation against Owner.\n\n  (b)   Commercial General Liability Insurance. Operator shall maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its operations under this  Agreement\n\n  including, without limitation, bodily injury, death, property damage, independent contractors, products/completed operations,  contractual, and personal injury liability, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars  ($2,000,000) in the annual aggregate.\n\n     8.1.2 To the extent of the liabilities assumed by Operator in this Agreement, Operator shall name Owner Indemnified Parties as additional  insured on all insurance policies, except Workers' Compensation. The Owner Indemnified Parties' additional insured status will not limit the  application of insurance protection as required by this Agreement which arises out of the Operator's indemnity obligations. These policies shall  provide primary coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties.",
                "changed_text": "8.1 Operator Insurance.\n\n     8.1.1 Operator shall maintain standard insurance coverage appropriate for its operations, with reputable insurance carriers.\n\n     8.1.2 Operator shall name Owner Indemnified Parties as additional insured on insurance policies. These policies shall provide coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific insurance requirements (Workers' Compensation and Commercial General Liability) while retaining the additional insured clause introduces a contradiction.  The agreement now implies specific insurance exists for which the Owner is an additional insured, but the details of this insurance are undefined, creating uncertainty. How can Owner be added to insurance if they dont' know what kind or amount?",

Sabco shall cause each car to be painted with paint schemes approved by each's primary sponsor and shall cause to display Prolong associate sponsor decal signage upon the middle side panel (between car number and rear tire; both sides of car) with dimensions of approximately 6 inches high by 16 inches long. In addition, Sabco shall provide, subject to Prolong's approval, drive, pit crew, team uniforms, team pit equipment, team race car transporter, show car and show car transporter bearing prominent Prolong associate sponsor identification as well as team pit equipment with size and placement commensurate with level of sponsorship",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific placement and dimensions of the decal, the modified text creates ambiguity. While Sabco is still required to display Prolong's signage, the exact location and size are no longer defined, leading to potential disputes and uncertainty in enforcement. This omission contradicts the initial intention of a clearly defined advertising space, allowing Sabco to potentially minimize the impact of Prolong's signage.",

Prolong shall be responsible for all first class travel expenses relating to each driver appearance, i.e. hotel, airfare, meals, etc. Additional appearances by Sabco drivers shall be at the discounted rate of [ * ] ($[ * ]) Dollars per day per driver, [ * ]. Sabco shall further provide the services of each driver for one free day for commercial use (up to six hours each) for still photo shoot, TV and radio/commercial production. Prolong shall be responsible for all first class travel expenses relating to each driver appearance, i.e. hotel, airfare, meals, etc. All Sabco drivers, while under contract with Team SABCO, shall allow their likeness, voice, picture and signature to be used for commercial purposes endorsing Prolong at no additional costs during the term of this agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics about the number of free appearances and the discounted rate for additional appearances, the clause becomes vague. While driver appearances are still part of the agreement, the number of free appearances, the duration of each appearance, and the cost of additional appearances are all undefined. This creates a contradiction because Prolong is still entitled to appearances, but the terms of those appearances are now unclear, leading to potential disagreements about the scope and cost of appearances beyond a potentially presumed minimum.",

Sabco agrees to provide at no expense to Prolong for its use in promoting its sponsorship, five (5) free show car appearance days whereas Prolong can deem which of the Sabco show cars to use. This shall mean that Prolong may schedule any combination of Sabco's three show cars (based on availability) not to exceed a total of five show days (travel days are considered a \"show date\"). Sabco will provide transportation of show car and will provide an attendant to stay with the car during its display period. For any show car appearance requested by Prolong over and above the five (5) free appearances, Sabco will make available unto Prolong a show car at a discounted rate of [ * ] Dollars ($ [ * ]) per day. All travel days to and from the site of a show car appearance, as well as the actual day upon which show car is on display will be charged as a \"show date\". It is further understood that the parties will agree in advance upon a schedule of places and events for the show car to be displayed at such times as will not interfere with Sabco's racing schedule.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics regarding the number of free show car appearances, the section now lacks a clear agreement on how many free appearances Prolong is entitled to. The elimination of the discounted rate for additional appearances introduces further ambiguity regarding any show car request beyond what might be implicitly understood to be 'reasonable.' This contradiction between the expectation of show car availability and the lack of specified terms opens the door to disputes over the frequency, cost, and availability of the show cars.",

                "original_text": "Decal location.  Sabco will designate Prolong as an associate sponsor on its No. 40, No. 42 and No. 46 Winston Cup race cars in the aforementioned 33 events. Sabco shall cause each car to be painted with paint schemes approved by each's primary sponsor and shall cause to display Prolong associate sponsor decal signage upon the middle side panel (between car number and rear tire; both sides of car) with dimensions of approximately 6\n\n  inches high by 16 inches long. In addition, Sabco shall provide, subject to Prolong's approval, drive, pit crew, team uniforms, team pit equipment, team race car transporter, show car and show car transporter bearing prominent Prolong associate sponsor identification as well as team pit equipment with size and placement commensurate with level of sponsorship",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific dimensions (6 inches high by 16 inches long) and location (middle side panel) of the Prolong decal, the contract becomes ambiguous. The altered text now states that the decal signage should be displayed with 'dimensions and placement commensurate with level of sponsorship' but provides no guidelines for determining what that means, leading to a potential dispute between the parties.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specified number of appearances (five aggregate driver appearances (2) two-hours each) and the provision for one free day of commercial use, the contract is left vague. The amended clause only mentions driver appearances at no fee, but does not provide a definite number or time, and does not mention the free day of commercial use, potentially creating conflict as Prolong may demand unlimited appearances, while Sabco may argue it never agreed to that, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

For any show car appearance requested by Prolong over and above the five (5) free appearances, Sabco will make available unto Prolong a show car at a discounted rate of [ * ] Dollars ($ [ * ]) per day. All travel days to and from the site of a show car appearance, as well as the actual day upon which show car is on display will be charged as a \"show date\". It is further understood that the parties will agree in advance upon a schedule of places and events for the show car to be displayed at such times as will not interfere with Sabco's racing schedule.",

Without any specification, Prolong may assume indefinite free appearance days, while Sabco can claim this was not their intention. The omission of the discounted rate also leaves the cost of additional appearances undefined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Updates' and their definition in Section 5.5, while Section 5 still refers to 'Updates', this creates an internal contradiction. The contract now lacks clarity on what constitutes an 'Update' and how it relates to the maintenance services.",

This omission contradicts Section 3, which outlines payment terms, and creates uncertainty on whether HSNS is entitled to maintenance if they have not paid for it.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the sentence 'Year 2 and Year 3 Quarterly Payments, as defined in Exhibit \"A,\" shall be based upon these annual reports', a contradiction is created. The requirement to provide annual reports remains, but the explicit link between those reports and the payments defined in Exhibit A is removed. This makes the payment calculation method unclear, given Exhibit A references these reports for payment adjustments. It undermines the enforceability of the payment terms in exhibit A.",

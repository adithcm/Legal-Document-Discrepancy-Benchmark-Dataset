                "original_text": "MMMW will provide on-call service for the Technical Infrastructure during the term of this Agreement from 7:00am to 5:00pm CST, with a guaranteed response time of 3 hours with a goal of on site within 2 hours. Support to include 7X24 hour pager support for emergency services. After the customer has 30 locations, MMMW will locate technical personnel in the current geography. If a system is not able to be on-line after hours, on-site help will be made available.",

After the customer has 30 locations, MMMW will locate technical personnel in the current geography. If a system is not able to be on-line after hours, on-site help will be made available.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific hours (7:00am to 5:00pm CST) and response time guarantees, the modified text introduces uncertainty about the service level. While on-call service is mentioned, the explicit parameters are omitted, making enforcement ambiguous, because section 8 indicates that the Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition provided it is continuously subject to MMMW's inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service.",

All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on thirty days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause about CPI capping, MMMW can change charge as it deems fit. This can be an enforcement nightmare, because section 8 indicates that the Technical Infrastructure remains in satisfactory operating condition provided it is continuously subject to MMMW's inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service; and subject to normal use and conditions. MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition.",

MMMW's sole and exclusive obligation under this warranty shall be at its option to repair or exchange any hardware not in satisfactory operating condition. Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",

Said obligation shall be subject to the conditions and charges of Section 3, 4 and 5 and the prompt submission of (or notification to MMMW of the problem) the hardware to MMMW for service.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'continuously subject to MMMW's inspection and acceptance of the hardware for service' from the conditions necessary for the warranty to be valid. This creates a contradiction because later in the agreement, MMMW's obligation is tied to conditions of Sections 3,4, and 5 which contains conditions depending on MMMW's inspection . Now the warranty section no longer mentions inspection.",

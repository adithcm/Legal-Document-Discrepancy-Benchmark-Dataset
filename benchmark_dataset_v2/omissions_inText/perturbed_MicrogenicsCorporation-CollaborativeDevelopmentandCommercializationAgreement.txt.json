The Shortfall License shall expire automatically [***] ([***]) months after the Supply Resumption Date; provided, however, that (a) Achaogen shall be entitled to use, sell, offer for sale, and import any assay that are in inventory prior to the expiration of the Shortfall License (even if such activity occurs after expiration of the Shortfall License).

                "explanation": "By removing the clearly specified metrics that determines when Microgenics grants the 'Shortfall License', but retain the mentioning of short fall license, it causes the license granting process to be vague and uncertain.

There is an in-text contradiction of retaining a license provision but not specifying how the triggers for the license is defined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specification that the success of each phase is determined in accordance with the Project Plan, an in-text contradiction is created. The section now states that payments are due upon the 'successful completion' of phases, but removes any objective criteria to determine what constitutes 'successful completion'. All deliverables that are required are no longer specified, which leads to an ambiguity in that contract. The text references payment upon successful completion, but the metrics to determine success are ambiguous.",

                "changed_text": "As a good faith gesture for the performance of services hereunder, Owner *may* pay Service Provider a service fee.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity. Previously, the Owner *shall* pay the Service Provider, indicating a clear obligation. The new text uses the word *may*, indicating a suggestion, creating uncertainty around the Owner's payment obligations. It contradicts later mentions of 'Services Fee' implying that it's not clear whether services will be compensated as the original contract indicates.",

                "explanation": "This creates contradiction, as it changes the payment terms completely, moving from a definite 30-day period to a discretionary schedule, and implies that late fee structures are not defined in the present document. Now, it is unclear when the service provider will be paid.",

                "changed_text": "Service Provider agrees to consider automobile insurance coverage. Specific coverage levels are subject to ongoing review and adjustment.",
                "explanation": "Original text contains an obligation to maintain a specified amount of automobile liability coverage. The altered text introduces uncertainty. The specific coverage levels are up for review and adjustment, potentially creating a contradiction if Service Provider chooses a lower amount of coverage or neglects it altogether. In addition, it's not clear that Service provider will provide any form of automobile liability insurance now.",

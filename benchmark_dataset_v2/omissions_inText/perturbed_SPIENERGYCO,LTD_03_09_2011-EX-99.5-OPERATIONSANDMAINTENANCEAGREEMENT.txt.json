Service Provider shall perform the maintenance portion of the Services in a clean, safe, efficient and environmentally reasonable manner and maintain the SEF in good operating and mechanical condition in accordance with this Agreement and (i) all applicable laws and permits, (ii) all applicable express warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who provided materials or labor under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement dated September 30, 2009 (the \"EPC Agreement\") for the SEF subject to the terms and limitations thereof, and (iii) all manufacturer's maintenance instructions and specifications.",

Service Provider shall perform the maintenance portion of the Services in a generally acceptable manner and maintain the SEF in a reasonable condition in accordance with this Agreement and (i) all applicable laws and permits, (ii) all applicable express warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who provided materials or labor under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement dated September 30, 2009 (the \"EPC Agreement\") for the SEF subject to the terms and limitations thereof, and (iii) all manufacturer's maintenance instructions and specifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text required 'clean, safe, efficient and environmentally reasonable manner,' but it has been changed to 'generally acceptable manner'. This introduces ambiguity. While the contract still stipulates compliance with laws, warranties, and instructions, the standard of performance is lowered. Section 1.9 mentions 'standards for the management and operation of an SEF of this size and type'. However, there is no legal term or conditions as to what 'generally acceptable' is to be interpreted by the parties, and opens it up to interpretation.",

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time with immediate effect by written notice to the other Party, if such other Party is in breach of its representations, warranties, obligations and covenants under the terms of this Agreement, which breach has remained uncured for more than thirty (30) days after initial notice of such breach from the nonbreaching Party to the other Party.",

                "explanation": "The original text required a cure period. The removal creates a scenario where a minor, curable breach immediately leads to termination. This contradicts Article 6 on Dispute Resolution, which advocates for good faith resolution and continuation of services by the Service Provider, which is for avoiding unnecessary losses. The 'cure' now is void.",

If there is no requirement for payment of those items from the original text, it can prevent an amicable, professional, and expeditious manner.",

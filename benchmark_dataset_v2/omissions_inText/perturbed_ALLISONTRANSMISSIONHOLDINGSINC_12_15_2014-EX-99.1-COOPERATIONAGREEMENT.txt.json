This introduces uncertainty regarding the applicability of key governance policies to the ValueAct Designee.",

                "explanation": "By removing '(and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement)' in Section 5(b), the Confidentiality Agreement may not survive after termination. Section 7 states that The Company hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the ValueAct Group may be provided confidential information in accordance with and subject to the terms of a Confidentiality Agreement, which implied that the Confidentiality Agreement will always be valid until a written notice to the contrary. This introduces uncertainty regarding the Confidentiality Agreement post-termination, potentially conflicting with the intended duration of confidentiality obligations and how long will the information be confidential. This makes the section and the enforcement vague and potentially null.",

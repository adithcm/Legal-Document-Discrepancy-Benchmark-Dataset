                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Controlled Substances Act, the definition of 'Applicable Laws' becomes vague. Later sections might assume compliance with these specific laws, creating a contradiction if the changed definition is interpreted narrowly.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause allowing EKR not to launch the product if it does not provide a gross margin of less than a certain amount or not commercially reasonable, it creates a contradiction as it forces EKR to launch regardless of commercial outcomes. It creates uncertainty as other sections rely on EKR's commercial success, which is now uncertain.",

Later sections discussing rights after termination may assume PPI has rights to EKR Improvements. It creates uncertainty as EKR might expect to be compensated for the termination of those rights which are ill-defined.",

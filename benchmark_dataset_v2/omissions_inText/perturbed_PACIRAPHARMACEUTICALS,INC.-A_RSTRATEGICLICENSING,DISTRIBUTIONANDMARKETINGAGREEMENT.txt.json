By removing this exclusion, the modified text introduces an ambiguity. It now becomes unclear whether Depobupivacaine and its improvements are considered competing products, which would significantly impact the non-compete obligations of EKR. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement of the non-compete clause.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the EKR Improvement clause, the contract now lacks clarity on the rights PPI has to EKR improvements upon termination, even though the initial statement states EKR improvements are owned by EKR. This omission generates a contradiction and thus uncertainty on how to deal with the improvements.",

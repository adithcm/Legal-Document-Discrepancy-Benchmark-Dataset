Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific quantity (30,000 lbs), CBD/TCH content requirements, and a list of specific contaminants the definition of 'Product' becomes vague. However, section 1B still references a purchase price based on a per-pound basis, which creates a contradiction as the total quantity is now undefined. The deletion of explicit requirements for CBD/TCH levels creates an enforceability issue, as section 1.C defines how the CBD potency number are determined, creating an obligation when it is not explicit that there is CBD in the product.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the price will be determined at a later date removes the price condition in the contract but section 1.D states that payment will be made upon execution of this agreement, resulting in a contradiction because without a purchase price, the payment term is rendered incoherent. This creates uncertainty for both parties.",

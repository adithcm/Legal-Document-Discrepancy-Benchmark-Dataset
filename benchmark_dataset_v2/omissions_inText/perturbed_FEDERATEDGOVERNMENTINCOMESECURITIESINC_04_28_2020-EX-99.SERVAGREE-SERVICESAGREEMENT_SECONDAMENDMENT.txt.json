                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to Section 5(b) of the Agreement, we introduce ambiguity. Other sections of the original service agreement might reference the definition provided in this part, leading to confusion as to which specific conditions apply to 'investment advisory services'. This change implies investment advisory services are defined, but removes the key definitional reference.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clauses that specify which parts of the agreement are affected by the Second Amendment introduces a contradiction. The original text clearly delineates how the agreement applies to accounts with and without equity trading. The removal eliminates this distinction, making it unclear how the Second Amendment modifies the Services Agreement. This omission creates uncertainty about the applicability of the new Equity Trading and Transaction Settlement, Fundamental Analysis and Quantitative Analysis sections.",

The equity trading desks execute buy and sell order based on instructions provided by affiliated advisers. The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies. 4. Fundamental Analysis. The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser. 5. Quantitative Analysis. Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers.",

                "explanation": "By omitting sections 4 and 5, which define Fundamental Analysis and Quantitative Analysis, while the remaining parts of the service agreement might reference them, an internal contradiction is created. Other sections mentioning 'analysis services' or 'quantitative research' would become ambiguous, as their definition is absent. This affects enforceability, as it's now unclear what constitutes the full scope of services.",

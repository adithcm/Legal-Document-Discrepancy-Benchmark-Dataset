Confidential Information.\n\n(a) \"Confidential Information\" means any information, materials or methods in whatever form or embodiment that has not been made available by Aduro to the general public and any information, materials or methods in the possession or control of Consultant on the Effective Date or developed in the performance of the Services, except that Confidential Information shall not include any information, material or method that (i) at the time of disclosure is in, or after disclosure becomes part of the public domain, through no improper act on the part of Consultant or any of its employees; (ii) was in Consultant's possession at the time of disclosure, as shown by written evidence, and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from work with Aduro; or (iii) Consultant receives from a third party, provided that such Confidential Information was not obtained by such third party, directly or indirectly, from Aduro.\n\nSpecific information disclosed as part of the Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be in the public domain or in the prior possession of Consultant merely because it is encompassed or contemplated by more general information in the public domain or in the prior possession of the Consultant. Failure to mark any of the Confidential Information as confidential or proprietary shall not affect its status as Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed definition of 'Confidential Information' and replacing it with 'information Aduro deems confidential,' the contract introduces ambiguity. Later sections (4b, 4c) still reference 'Confidential Information' and obligations related to it, but now the scope of what constitutes Confidential Information is subjective and dependent on Aduro's determination, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\")' we create an omission where the non-solicitation is vaguely defined for the end date. This contradicts the idea of any time constraints which causes the enforcement to be uncertain and undefined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'material non-public information' and 'on the basis of material non-public information' in section 9, we contradict the definition of the Insider Trading policy. Now, any information learned about Aduro or companies working with them and bought or sold, would be considered illegal. The Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy may not consider everything 'illegal' to trade on, which creates an in text contradiction and enforcement is uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to \"Management Measures for Cooperation in Mobile Game Business (V1.0)\" but later sections still reference it, the text now contains an internal contradiction. The contract stipulates that the fee structure changes must be implemented and confirmed through \"Management Measures for Cooperation in Mobile Game Business (V1.0)\". This omission creates ambiguity in how billing and settlements are to be handled because there are no precise mechanisms defined anymore.",

For the second time of the aforementioned violation, the amount of performance bond shall be additionally paid at RMB3,000 per time on the basis of the amount previous paid.

                "explanation": "By changing the definition of the payment from performance bond to deposit (6.1) and removing the amounts to be paid in the other sections, the meaning of performance bond is conflicted, and creates an in-text contradiction with Section 6 as the amount of penalties is undefined, thereby creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

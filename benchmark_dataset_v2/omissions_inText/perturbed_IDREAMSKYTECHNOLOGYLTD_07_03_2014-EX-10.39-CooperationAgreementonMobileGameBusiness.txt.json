All billing and settlement shall be subject to the provisions of Management Measures for Cooperation in Mobile Game Business (V1.0).",

All billing and settlement terms will be separately negotiated.",
                "explanation": "Removing the reference to 'Management Measures for Cooperation in Mobile Game Business (V1.0)' creates an in-text contradiction because the contract elsewhere relies on this document for detailed settlement practices. Now, the general principle is defined but the specific process to follow is not, opening the possibility to future disagreement.",

Such system shall include, without limitation: (1) Customer service call: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in service, which shall be service numbers starting with 800 or 4008, and shall notbe ordinary in-city number or mobile number; (2) Platform functions: customer systems having such functions as exchange, automatic call distribution, computer telephony integration,interactive voice response, manual agent, recording, data base, business preposition, etc.; (3) Business functions: customer service center will have mainly functions represented by in-calls and manual service, such as informationinquiries, business cancellation, business consulting and complaint handling; (4) Seat placing: SP's customer service shall have at least 5 seats and 12 in-call customer service staff; (5) System performance and business targets: call completion rate by the system: 99% and level of service (call completion rate by manualservice in 20 seconds): 80%; (6) Email box for complaints.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed specifications for Party B's customer service system, and referencing a 'shared system' the contract introduces ambiguity. Previous clauses dictate response times based on B's system, but now there's no clarity on how those rules apply to the 'shared system'. This causes confusion about responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "6.1 Upon negotiations between the Parties, Party B will provide a performance bond to Party A after this Agreement comes into force. Details will be determined separately. 6.2 If Party A discovers in its spot checks conducted from time to time that any game, software, business, works, content or service provided by Party B is not in compliance with laws, regulations, industry rules, Party A's management measures or contractual agreement, Party B shall be subject to penalties.",
                "explanation": "Removing the amounts of the performance bond and penalties creates ambiguity. Later clauses still reference the 'performance bond' and deductions from it, but the actual value is undefined. The contract continues to allow Party A to make deductions from a number that no longer exists.",

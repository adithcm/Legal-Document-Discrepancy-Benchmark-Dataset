Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that any Expense category listed in section 4.1 is also included on Exhibit 4.1(c), Exhibit 4.1(c) shall control and such Expenses shall not be double counted. There will be no double counting or payment of Expenses to the extent that Expenses appear or are contained in more than one Expense category. As used herein, the following terms have the following respective meanings: (i) \"Central Service Expenses\" means costs and expenses for Merchant's central administrative services necessary for the GOB Sale, including, but not limited to, internal payroll processing, MIS services, cash and inventory reconciliation, data processing and reporting, information technology updates, functionality, and maintenance, and accounting (collectively, \"Central Services\"). (ii) \"Excluded Payroll Benefits\" means (i) the following benefits arising, accruing or attributable to the period prior to, during, or after the Sale Term: (w) vacation days or vacation pay, (x) sick days or sick leave or any other form of paid time off, (y) maternity leave or other leaves of absence and (z) ERISA coverage and similar contributions and/or (ii) any other benefits in excess of the Payroll Benefits Cap, including, without limitation, any payments due under the WARN Act.

(iv) \"Third Party\" means, with reference to any Expenses to be paid to a Third Party, a party which is not affiliated with or related to Merchant. (v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, \"Expenses\" shall not include: (i) Excluded Payroll Benefits; (ii) Central Service Expenses, (iii) Occupancy Expenses or any occupancy-related expenses of any kind or nature in excess of the respective per Store occupancy- related amounts expressly provided for as an Expense under Section 4.1(c) above; (iv) any expenses of any kind relating to or arising from Merchant's home office, and/or (v) any other costs, expenses or liabilities payable by Merchant not provided for herein, all of which shall be paid solely by Merchant (including from the Wind-Down Payment, to the extent provided in the Wind-Down Budget).",
                "changed_text": "Subject to and only upon entry of the Approval Order, Agent shall be unconditionally responsible for certain \"Expenses,\" which shall be paid by Agent in accordance with Section 4.2 below. As used herein, \"Expenses\" shall mean reasonable expenses incurred during the Sale Term, as determined by Agent in its sole discretion. A detailed breakdown of potential expense categories is outlined in Exhibit X. For clarity, Expenses do not include Central Service Expenses or Excluded Payroll Benefits.",
                "explanation": "By making the definition of 'Expenses' vague and referring to an undefined 'Exhibit X,' this change introduces significant ambiguity and contradiction. The original text clearly listed the specific expenses covered, but now, the definition relies on Agent's subjective determination and a non-existent exhibit. This contradicts the intent of providing a concrete definition and creates uncertainty about what expenses Agent is actually responsible for. Furthermore, the mention of 'Exhibit X' introduces inconsistencies, as there is no such exhibit, and leaves room for dispute.",

                "original_text": "Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order. Nothing contained in these Sale Guidelines shall be construed to create or impose upon Agent any additional restrictions not contained in the applicable lease agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Agent shall have broad discretion to utilize displays and signage in connection with the Sale. The specific types and placements of signage will be subject to mall management approval, where applicable. Nothing in these Sale Guidelines shall be construed to create or impose upon Agent any additional restrictions not contained in the applicable lease agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed restrictions on signage (e.g., the prohibition of neon/day-glo signs, size limitations for banners, and limitations on signs in common areas), the modified text contradicts the intention of providing clear boundaries for advertising. While it acknowledges the need for mall management approval, it otherwise grants Agent a large degree of freedom, creating potential conflicts with lease agreements that may contain strict signage restrictions. This generates ambiguity and internal contradiction, especially given a general statement of being subjected to the lease agreement.",

Merchant represents that (i) the ticketed prices of all items of Merchandise do not and shall not include any Sales Taxes and (ii) all registers located at the Stores are programmed to correctly compute all Sales Taxes required to be paid by the customer under applicable law, as such calculations have been identified to Merchant by its retained service provider.",

                "explanation": "By stating that the Merchant will 'endeavor to ticket all items,' but also acknowledging that some items may be sold without tickets, introduces an explicit contradiction. The original language ensured consistent pricing and tax calculation by requiring proper ticketing. This change, and the lack of clarity on what pricing and sales tax calculation would be used in un-ticketed items, creates a contradiction and uncertainty with regards to sales tax compliance.",

                "explanation": "This change omits several important expense categories from Agent's responsibilities, including payroll, benefits, occupancy expenses, and retention bonuses. However, sections 9.3 and 9.4 still refer to Agent's responsibilities regarding employee payroll, benefits and bonuses, creating an in-text contradiction. This omission creates uncertainty as to who is responsible for those expenses if disputes arise.",

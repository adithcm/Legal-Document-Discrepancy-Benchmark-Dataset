Except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, at all times during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on a date to be mutually agreed upon by both parties, the White Hat Parties shall not, and shall cause the White Hat Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, in any manner, alone or in concert with others: (a) attempt to call a special meeting of stockholders of the Company; or (b) make a request for any stockholder list or other Company books and records, whether pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the specific end date of the Support Period with a vague reference to 'a date to be mutually agreed upon,' an omission is created. Section 4 refers to 'the Support Period' for termination, which now lacks a clear definition, leading to uncertainty and potential contradictions regarding when the agreement actually terminates. This impacts the enforceability of obligations tied to the Support Period.",

The White Hat Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties on the record date (if the 2020 Annual Meeting is within thirty (30) days of the anniversary of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such number of shares shall be no less than 90% of the Current Position) for such meeting (i) in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company and against any stockholder nominated candidate not endorsed by the Board, (ii) against the stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act as disclosed to the White Hat Parties prior to the execution of this Agreement, (iii) to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (iv) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and new equity compensation plan (collectively, the \"2020 Proposals\"), provided, that with respect to the proposals described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of this Section 4, the White Hat Parties may vote in accordance with the recommendation of Institutional Shareholders Services to the extent such recommendation differs from the voting commitments set forth herein and provided that the White Hat Parties do not publicly disclose their vote on such proposals if it differs from the Board's recommendation; and provided, further, that White Hat Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the White Hat Parties in their sole discretion with respect to all other proposals brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting.

                "explanation": "Removing the clauses providing exceptions to the voting commitments made by White Hat Parties creates a contradiction. The modified text states they *shall* vote in certain ways, but the removal of the 'provided that' clause eliminates their ability to vote according to Institutional Shareholders Services' recommendations or their discretion on other matters. This rigidly restricts their voting rights where the original text allowed flexibility. The reference to the '2020 Proposals' remains, but the context for permissible deviations has been omitted, leading to an internal contradiction.",

(b) Based on the Information, the Nominating and Governance Committee (the \"Nominating Committee\") of the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of the Company and the Board have determined that the New Director may serve as an \"independent\" director of the Company in accordance with the rules and listing standards of the NASDAQ National Market and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

                "explanation": "By omitting subsection (b), the contract removes the explicit statement that the Board determined the New Director is \"independent\" according to NASDAQ rules. Later sections (like section 4, referencing Board-nominated directors) implicitly assume the director's independence. However, without subsection (b), there's no guarantee or explicit declaration of independence, creating a contradiction: the agreement proceeds as if the director is independent, but that key qualification is no longer explicitly stated or assured, potentially jeopardizing compliance with NASDAQ regulations. Furthermore the information relating to compliance with Item 401 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has been removed which potentially conflicts other company wide rules.",

                "original_text": "(f) Price Protection. If at any time on or prior to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2007, or (ii) the date on which Global Energy completes an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, Global Energy sells additional common shares or other financial instruments convertible into its common shares, or enters into any similar transaction for the sale of an ownership interest in Global Energy which is the same or substantially the same as that sold to Oxbow under Section 1 of this Agreement, and the price of which is less than $200.00 per share, Global Energy shall issue additional common shares to Oxbow such that Oxbow's adjusted per-share price for its stockholdings shall be no greater than the lowest price paid by any such subsequent purchaser of its shares. It is understood that the price protection afforded by this covenant extends to and includes the offering price pursuant to the IPO.",

If Global Energy sells additional common shares or other financial instruments convertible into its common shares, Global Energy may issue additional common shares to Oxbow. It is understood that the price protection afforded by this covenant extends to and includes the offering price pursuant to the IPO.",
                "explanation": "The omission of the specific price protection terms (date, price per share, and mechanism for adjustment) creates uncertainty. The original text clearly dictates that Oxbow is entitled to additional shares if Global Energy sells shares at a lower price. The modified text makes it discretionary ('may issue') and removes the defined threshold. This contradicts the original intent and creates ambiguity, and also refers to IPO, which becomes more critical because the previous terms have been removed.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for employees, advisors etc. to agree to abide by confidentiality terms, the contract still permits disclosure to these parties, but without requiring them to maintain confidentiality. This creates an inconsistency because the main clause (c) states that confidential information shall not be disclosed without prior written consent, yet the exceptions in (i) and (ii) now lack the crucial safeguard of ensuring that recipients are bound by the same confidentiality obligations. The liability clause is also removed, which generates further uncertainty. ",

                "explanation": "The omission of the 'Survival' clause creates uncertainty regarding the fate of existing agreements and Oxbow's ownership of shares post-termination. This directly contradicts the 'Remedies' section, which suggests all appropriate relief is available, but now lacks clarity on whether that includes maintaining ownership or specific project agreements. Also, removing the survival clause impacts the value of the shares. This has a significant impact on the strategic alliance objectives since there are ongoing projects with the mentioned counterparties.",

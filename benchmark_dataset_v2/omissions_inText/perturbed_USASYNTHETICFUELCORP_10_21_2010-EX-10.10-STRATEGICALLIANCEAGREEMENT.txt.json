                "original_text": "The Parties hereby form a strategic alliance having the following key elements: (a) Preferred Suppliers. Oxbow and Global Energy hereby designate one another as their preferred suppliers of certain goods and services, as follows: (i) Oxbow shall be the preferred petroleum coke supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy. (ii) Oxbow shall be a preferred supplier of coal, coal fines, gob or waste coal products (collectively, \"Coal\") to gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy. (iii) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification technology supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects majority owned or controlled by Oxbow. (iv) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification project operator for petroleum coke gasification projects at sites majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties hereby form a strategic alliance having the following key elements: (a) Preferred Suppliers. Oxbow and Global Energy may consider one another as potential suppliers of certain goods and services. (i) Oxbow may be a petroleum coke supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy. (ii) Oxbow may be a supplier of coal, coal fines, gob or waste coal products (collectively, \"Coal\") to gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy. (iii) Global Energy may be the gasification technology supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects majority owned or controlled by Oxbow. (iv) Global Energy may be the gasification project operator for petroleum coke gasification projects at sites majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly designates each party as the 'preferred supplier'. The revised text uses 'may consider' and 'may be', removing the certainty of the preference. This creates ambiguity and weakens the commitment to the strategic alliance. It also contradicts the later sections, which may assume the existence of a firm agreement for preferred supplier status.",

                "original_text": "If at any time on or prior to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2007, or (ii) the date on which Global Energy completes an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, Global Energy sells additional common shares or other financial instruments convertible into its common shares, or enters into any similar transaction for the sale of an ownership interest in Global Energy which is the same or substantially the same as that sold to Oxbow under Section 1 of this Agreement, and the price of which is less than $200.00 per share, Global Energy shall issue additional common shares to Oxbow such that Oxbow's adjusted per-share price for its stockholdings shall be no greater than the lowest price paid by any such subsequent purchaser of its shares. It is understood that the price protection afforded by this covenant extends to and includes the offering price pursuant to the IPO.",
                "changed_text": "If Global Energy sells additional common shares or other financial instruments convertible into its common shares, or enters into any similar transaction for the sale of an ownership interest in Global Energy which is the same or substantially the same as that sold to Oxbow under Section 1 of this Agreement, Global Energy will consider issuing additional shares to Oxbow.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides clear price protection to Oxbow, compelling Global Energy to issue additional shares if subsequent sales are at a lower price. The modified version weakens this significantly by removing the specific dates and replacing 'shall issue' with 'will consider issuing'. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the price protection and contradicts the initial investment agreement that likely hinged on this protection.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, and so long as Oxbow continues to own at least 15,000 common shares of Global Energy (as such amount may be adjusted to reflect any subsequent stock splits), Global Energy agrees that Oxbow shall have a seat on Global Energy's Board of Directors.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Global Energy may allow Oxbow to observe meetings of Global Energy's Board of Directors.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides Oxbow a guaranteed seat on the Board of Directors, contingent upon a minimum shareholding. The modified version replaces this guaranteed seat with an opportunity to 'observe' board meetings. This significantly reduces Oxbow's influence and contradicts the spirit of a strategic alliance, where board representation is a key element of control and collaboration. It also removes any mention of the 15,000 share contingency, thus making it more vague and unenforceable.",

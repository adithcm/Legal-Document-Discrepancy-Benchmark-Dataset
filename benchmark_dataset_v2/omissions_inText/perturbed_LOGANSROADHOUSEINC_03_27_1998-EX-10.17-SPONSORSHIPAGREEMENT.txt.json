                "original_text": "SRP will build and provide to Logan's a 1997 Ford Thunderbird automobile (\"Show Car\") that will have an appearance identical to that of the race car, to include full roll cage, race interior, paint, graphics and under-hood race look. Logan's will provide equipment and driver to transport the Show Car to destinations and according to schedules as determined by Logan's. At the expiration of this contract, Logan's will return the Show Car to SRP in substantially the same condition as when received by Logan's, normal wear and tear excepted.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics of what the show car entails and its expected condition upon return (including 'full roll cage, race interior, paint, graphics and under-hood race look' and 'substantially the same condition as when received by Logan's, normal wear and tear excepted'), the modified text creates ambiguity. If the race car’s standards change over the race season (logos removed, etc.) there is no requirement to keep the Show Car aligned with the same graphics as the Race Car. This omission creates uncertainty in Logan's obligation to maintain the Show Car. It also removes SRP’s obligation to building a 1997 Ford Thunderbird.",

                "explanation": "By removing the word 'materially' from the breach condition in (i), and removing the portion of (ii) reading 'or the products of the Terminating Party into public hatred or contempt, or engages in conduct that shocks or insults the community or brings the Terminating Party, or its products into public disrespect, scandal or ridicule;', the modified text broadens the scope of termination. Now, a minor breach can result in termination where before it had to be 'material'. The standard of 'crime involving moral turpitude' is also diminished and the Terminating Party does not have to be at risk of 'public disrespect, scandal or ridicule' to terminate the agreement. ",

                "explanation": "By removing '(rear facing panel, TV panel)' and 'which shall not be unreasonably withheld', the omission creates a potential contradiction. Without defining what the deck lid is, there can be disagreement on where Logan’s signage should go. Removing the 'not be unreasonably withheld' clause gives Logan's the ability to deny any signage from SRP's associate and secondary sponsors. This could create an issue later if SRP relied on signage of other sponsors to offset costs.",

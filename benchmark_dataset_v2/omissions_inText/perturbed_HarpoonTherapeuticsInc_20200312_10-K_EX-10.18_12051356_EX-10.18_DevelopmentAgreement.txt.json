Such efforts will be determined according to the specific circumstances at the time.",
                "explanation": "The definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" is modified to be more general and subjective, removing any specific [***] previously defined in the original contract. This creates uncertainty, as the level of effort required is now open to interpretation. In Article 4.2, AbbVie's diligence obligations are tied to 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts'. By changing the definition, the enforcement of this diligence obligation becomes ambiguous. If AbbVie does not meet a previously agreed upon [***], it may be harder to establish a breach of contract.",

By removing the [***] subsections, the precise calculation is now ambiguous. This creates issues because milestone payments are tied to Net Sales in Article 6. The simpler definition makes enforcement more difficult, especially if [***] were previously defined in the removed subsections.",

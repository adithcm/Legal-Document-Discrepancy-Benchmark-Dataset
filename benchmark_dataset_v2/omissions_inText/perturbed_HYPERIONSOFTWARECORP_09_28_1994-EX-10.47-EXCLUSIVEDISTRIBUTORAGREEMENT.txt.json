                "explanation": "By removing the specific royalty percentages based on gross software revenue, the contract introduces uncertainty. Later, section 2.3 mentions 'License Renewal and Maintenance Fees will be split evenIy with 50% distributed to Developer and 50% distributed to Distributor, also subject to paragraph 4 of this section 2.3.' Paragraph 4 speaks about royalties to entities outside the territory affecting allocation to Distributor. If royalties are not clearly defined based on revenue, it creates uncertainty in enforcing the split.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Schedule F, which defines the terms of the World Wide Retainer, there's now ambiguity regarding the specific support obligations. This creates a conflict because, without Schedule F, the precise services, response times, and other conditions are undefined, making it difficult to determine if Distributor is fulfilling its support obligations as stated in the agreement.",

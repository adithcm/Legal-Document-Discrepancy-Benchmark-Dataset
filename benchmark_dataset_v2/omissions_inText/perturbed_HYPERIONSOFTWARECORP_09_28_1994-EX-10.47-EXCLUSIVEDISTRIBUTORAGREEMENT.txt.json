                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that royalties are based on 'Developer's list prices in U.S. Dollars' and fixed percentages for revenue sharing. The modified version changes this to 'prices generally accepted in the market' and 'percentages deemed reasonable by both parties' with 'negotiable' percentages, removing the fixed pricing formula and introducing ambiguity. This creates a contradiction because other sections of the contract may assume a fixed royalty calculation, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

As mutually agreeable, Developer, Developer's affiliates, or Distributor may each provide local support to the sites of multi-location clients, each on behalf of the other where the provisions of such support will enhance the quality of support provided to the client. Such services will be provided at the local billing rate or such alternative billing rate as shall be agreed between the parties. The party providing the support shall receive all revenues arising therefrom unless otherwise agreed. Furthermore, it is understood that travel expenses, if any, are to be borne by the client utilizing the support services or by the Distributor unless otherwise agreed.

                "explanation": "Changing the phrase 'any copyright with respect to the Product(s)' to 'intellectual property' broadens the scope of the indemnification clause, creating an ambiguity. While subsequent clauses (a), (b) and (c) still refer to 'the Product(s)', Section 9.3 still indemnifies claims against 'the Products' against claims resulting from 'the combination, operation or use of the Products with any hardware, products, programs or data not supplied or approved in writing by Developer'. This introduces a potential conflict. Is the product indemnified? Or is any intellectual property under consideration?",

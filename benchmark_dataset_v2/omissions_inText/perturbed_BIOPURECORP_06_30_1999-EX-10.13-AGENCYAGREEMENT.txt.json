The Territory is defined as that geographical area in which said Agent is represented by a full time field sales representative, and of which assigned Distributor agrees to be responsible for mutually agreed upon quarterly and annual sales objectives as described in the \"Business Plan\". Compensation by the Company to the Agent will be limited to the area stated as follows:\n\nThe 48 Continental United States (including DC) plus Alaska    3\n\nNo compensation will be earned by the Agent for sales generated from customers in geographical areas not indicated in this section 1.2.",

Compensation by the Company to the Agent will be for sales generated from Customers regardless of geographical location. \n\nNo compensation will be earned by the Agent for sales generated from customers in geographical areas not indicated in this section 1.2.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific geographical limitations while retaining the clause 'No compensation will be earned by the Agent for sales generated from customers in geographical areas not indicated in this section 1.2.' creates a contradiction. The first part of the edited clause suggests compensation regardless of location, while the retained clause restricts it to specific areas, causing uncertainty in enforcement.",

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Company will at its sole expense:\n\n(d) compensate the Agent through a discount of eight (8) percent off of the current price of the Product times the total monthly units shipped at that price to the Customer in the Agent's Territory excluding any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company. The Company will compensate the Agent an additional two (2) percent through a discount off of the current price or promotional price of the Product times the total monthly units shipped at that price to the Customer excluding any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company, so as to compensate the Agent's sales representatives. Therefore, a total of ten (10) percent discount off of the current price list or promotional price times the total monthly units shipped at that price to the Customer will be applied as payment for services from the Agent including, but not limited to, the promotion, sales, and collection of payment from the Customer for Product shipped by the Company. In addition the Company will compensate the Agent quarterly an additional two (2) percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and /or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company, based upon the attainment of mutually agreed upon quarterly goals. One (1) percent of this incentive is additional compensation for the Agent, and one (1) percent is for additional compensation of the Agency sales force. In the event the Agent fails to achieve these goals during any given quarter yet is able to achieve the overall annual goals, then the Agent will receive the incentive commission for that quarter at the conclusion of the fiscal year. These goals are outlined in exhibit B.",

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Company will at its sole expense:\n\n(d) compensate the Agent through a discount based on a percentage to be decided and based on the sales made to the Customer in the Agent's Territory excluding any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company. In addition the Company will compensate the Agent quarterly an additional percentage to be decided percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and /or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company, based upon the attainment of mutually agreed upon quarterly goals.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific percentage amounts for discounts and commissions introduces ambiguity. The contract still states that discounts and commissions will be paid, but the lack of defined percentages, and referral to goals creates uncertainty and potential disputes over the actual compensation amounts, especially because the Exhibit B with the goals is still referenced.",

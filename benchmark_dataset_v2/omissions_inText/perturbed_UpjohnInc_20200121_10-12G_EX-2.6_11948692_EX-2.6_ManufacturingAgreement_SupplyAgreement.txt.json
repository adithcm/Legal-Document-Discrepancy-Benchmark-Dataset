Depreciation will be based on original acquisition cost of fixed assets, and not impacted by fair value accounting for business transactions.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'including the cost of active ingredients, intermediates, semi-finished materials, excipients and primary and secondary packaging' in the definition of Standard Cost in Section 1.113, it introduces ambiguity as to what constitutes 'Product Materials'. If Section 3.1(c) still refers to the initial definition to be applied when determining Product pricing, the definition of which items are covered is no longer clear. This creates uncertainty in enforcement of payment terms.",

As a C-TPAT member, Customer is required to make periodic assessment of its international supply chain based upon C-TPAT security criteria. Manufacturer agrees to conduct and document an annual security audit at each of its Facilities and to take all necessary corrective actions to ensure the continued participation of Customer in C- TPAT. Manufacturer agrees to share with Customer the results of such annual audits and agrees to prepare and submit to Customer a report on the corrective actions taken in response thereto. In addition, Customer may audit Manufacturer's Records and Facilities for the purpose of verifying that Manufacturer's procedures are in accordance with the C-TPAT security criteria, and Manufacturer shall provide Customer with access to Manufacturer's Records and Facilities reasonably necessary for the purpose of conducting such audit. Manufacturer agrees to notify Customer of any event that has resulted in or threatens the loss of its C-TPAT Benefits (if it is a member of the C-TPAT program) or alternatively jeopardizes Customer's retention of its own C-TPAT Benefits. In an effort to secure each part of the supply chain, Manufacturer agrees to work in good faith to become a member of the C-TPAT program, if Manufacturer is organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada, or the equivalent supply chain security program criteria administered by the customs administration in Manufacturer's home country if Manufacturer is not organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement that Manufacturer conduct annual security audits, Section 14.2 now contradicts the covenant established in Section 14.1, which states Manufacturerâ€™s security procedures are aligned with C-TPAT. This inconsistency creates a contradiction about the specific level of security compliance expected, creating uncertainty in whether those standards are actively enforced.",

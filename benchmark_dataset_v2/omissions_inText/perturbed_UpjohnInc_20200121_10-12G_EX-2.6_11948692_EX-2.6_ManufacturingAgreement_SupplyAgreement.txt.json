Section 9.3(b) previously required specific grounds to be provided, but now with the clause omitted, there is no obligation to specify the reasons for the additional meeting. This might contradict other sections suggesting transparency and justification for invoking certain procedures. It may also create uncertainty in enforcement as the other party might contest the legitimacy of the additional meeting due to lack of specified grounds, making decisions stemming from such meeting contestable.",

                "explanation": "The omission of the sections defining words with gender, singular/plural forms and the meaning of words like include and or (i) (A) to (H) from Section 17.11 creates ambiguity and potential in-text contradictions. The agreement now lacks a prescribed method for interpreting these commonly used terms. This introduces uncertainty because, without these rules, parties might interpret these terms differently, leading to disputes over the meaning of contractual obligations. For example, if the agreement refers to a singular entity but the context is ambiguous, it's unclear if the plural is also implied. This affects enforcement by making it difficult to objectively determine the parties' obligations.",

                "explanation": "Omitting 'subject to Section 3.2(c)' introduces an in-text contradiction within Section 12.1(a). Originally, the price determination for Buy-Sell Materials was explicitly tied to the price adjustments outlined in Section 3.2(c). By removing this reference, the agreement suggests Customer has unfettered control over pricing, potentially conflicting with the intent of Section 3.2 which outlines a more controlled process for price adjustments. This ambiguity creates uncertainty in enforcement. Manufacturer could argue the implied link to Section 3.2 still exists based on the broader context of price adjustments, while Customer might assert its right to set prices unilaterally, leading to disputes and difficulties in enforcing the pricing for Buy-Sell Materials.",

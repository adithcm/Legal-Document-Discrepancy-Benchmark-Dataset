                "explanation": "The removal of 'the reasonable costs and expenses of attorneys’, accountants’, consultants’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses incurred in the investigation or defense thereof or the enforcement of rights hereunder.' creates uncertainty because section 10 on Indemnification relies on this definition. If legal fees are excluded from the definition of Losses, it is unclear if they are covered under the indemnification clauses.",

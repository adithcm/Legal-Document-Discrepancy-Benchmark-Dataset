Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period by written amendment to this Agreement. All amendments to this Agreement must be signed by all parties to this Agreement.",

Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period at the sole discretion of the Company. All such additions will be communicated via email to NFLA-NC and NFLA.",
                "explanation": "By initially limiting the 'Licensed Products' and stating that additions are at the 'sole discretion of the Company' and communicated via email, this change contradicts Section Four (Remuneration) which lists other products like Zezel Probiotic Water and Gridiron CBD H2O Probiotics™ Water and necessitates a written amendment signed by all parties for any changes to 'Licensed Products'. This creates an internal contradiction regarding which products are subject to the donation clause and how products are added to the list, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

Donated amounts will be allocated and dispersed to a mutually agreed-upon charitable organization beginning on a schedule to be determined by the company and NFLA-NC. Unit conversion rates will be assessed annually.",
                "explanation": "By changing the donation amount to 'amount to be determined', and removing the specific per-unit conversion rates along with altering the allocation schedule, it contradicts any implied fixed donation amount and schedule elsewhere in the agreement. This will make it difficult to enforce the remuneration terms, as the key elements are now undefined.",

                "explanation": "Changing the fixed percentage of 15% to 'a percentage based on mutual agreement' and changing 'quarterly sales report' to 'sales data as is reasonably practical' introduces ambiguity and removes the obligation for regular, specific reporting, conflicting with Section Four's original intent for transparent and timely donations.",

                "changed_text": "1.4 \"Batch\" shall mean a quantity of the Product. The specific quantity will be determined by Dexcel based on manufacturing needs.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines \"Batch\" with a specific, though redacted, tablet count. The modified text removes this defined quantity and delegates batch size determination to Dexcel, creating potential disputes regarding order fulfillment and pricing if later sections rely on a fixed batch size for calculations or minimum order quantities. Later sections may refer to 'a batch' implying a fixed value.",

                "explanation": "The original contract section explicitly lists the supply prices for various product configurations. By replacing this with a vague reference to a 'pricing schedule' and market conditions, the contract removes a crucial element of price certainty. Subsequent sections that refer to 'the Supply Price' or 'current Supply Price' (e.g., 3.3.1) become ambiguous and unenforceable without the schedule. This is also reinforced in section 3.5.1, which states \"Commencing with ****, Dexcel may adjust the Supply Price for the next following Year not more often than ****.\", implying a current price exists.",

                "changed_text": "4.1 The Parties acknowledge the importance of product quality. Specific quality control procedures will be determined through ongoing collaboration.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a concrete requirement to finalize a Quality Agreement within a defined timeframe. The modified version removes this requirement, replacing it with a general statement of intent. This creates ambiguity because other sections (e.g., 3.3.5, 3.7.1, 4.2) reference the 'Quality Agreement,' assuming its existence and specific content regarding responsibilities and standards. Without it, these sections become difficult to enforce and interpret, leading to potential disputes over product quality and liability.",

                "original_text": "E. 'Gross sales' as used in this Section 3.01 shall mean the amount of gross revenues received by You from all sources, including without limitation sales of Products, services or other merchandise of every kind or nature from, at or in connection with the operation of the AIRSOPURE Center granted herein, excluding state, federal or local sales taxes collected from customers and paid to the appropriate taxing authority.",
                "changed_text": "E. 'Gross sales' as used in this Section 3.01 shall mean the amount of gross revenues received by You from sales of Products. Further clarification of includable or excludable revenue will be detailed in subsequent amendments.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the definition of 'Gross sales' to only include revenue from 'sales of Products' and indicating that further clarification will be in later amendments, it creates ambiguity and potential conflict, especially if these amendments are never issued or contradict the original intent elsewhere in the contract. If other sections continue to reference 'Gross Sales' without this limited definition, it's unclear whether services, leases, or other merchandise are part of the royalty calculation. This creates enforcement uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "F. You will not modify the Products.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause 'and You will not offer or carry any products or services other than AIRSOPURE's Products and services specified by AIRSOPURE without written approval from AIRSOPURE' creates a potential contradiction. Other sections of the agreement might assume that franchisees are *only* selling/leasing Airsopure products. If the franchisee begins selling competing products, it creates a conflict, as some sections might not allow for it based on assumptions. If the Products are being altered or modified to work with another company's product, there is no contractual procedure that the franchisee can utilize. This creates enforcement uncertainty.",

                "changed_text": "F. You shall file an assumed name registration.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and shall execute any documents deemed necessary by AIRSOPURE to obtain protection for the Licensed Marks or to maintain their continued validity and enforceability.', the contract no longer requires the franchisee to actively help protect the trademark. However, other clauses might imply the franchisee has a vested interest in maintaining the brand's integrity, leading to a contradiction. For example, Section 7.04: You shall promptly notify AIRSOPURE of any unauthorized use of the Licensed Marks or marks confusingly similar thereto, any challenge to the validity of the Licensed Marks, or any challenge to AIRSOPURE's ownership of, or Your right to use, the Licensed Marks. This is an assumption of responsibility on the franchisees end, but without the explicit responsibility to execute documents to maintain validity and enforceability, the franchisee may not feel the need to protect AIRSOPURE from challenges to the trademark.",

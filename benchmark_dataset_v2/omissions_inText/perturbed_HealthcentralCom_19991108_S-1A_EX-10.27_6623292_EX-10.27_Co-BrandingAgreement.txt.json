                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to 'Schedule 2', the contract now lacks a defined metric for acceptable user traffic. The original text obligates MediaLinx to use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to increase promotion until the site reaches the 'levels outlined in Schedule 2'. The revised version replaces 'levels outlined in Schedule 2' with 'acceptable levels', introducing ambiguity. This contradiction and omission create uncertainty in enforcement because 'acceptable levels' is subjective and undefined within the contract.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the reference to '[*] US' which defines the exact amount of the monthly payment, it contradicts other clauses that assume the payment amount is fixed and known. Removing the fixed amount introduces ambiguity, making it unclear how payments will be calculated or enforced. This omission contradicts other sections of the contract which references to payments.

                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to 'Schedule 3', which contains detailed guidelines and requirements for maintaining Canadian content, the contract becomes vague and unenforceable. The original text ties the required level of Canadian content to both the 'HealthyWay section' and 'Schedule 3'. The revised version removes Schedule 3, replacing it with 'standards found on similar Canadian websites', which is subjective and lacks a concrete definition. This creates an in-text contradiction because Schedule 9 details content moderation on the other hand. The omitted definition creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

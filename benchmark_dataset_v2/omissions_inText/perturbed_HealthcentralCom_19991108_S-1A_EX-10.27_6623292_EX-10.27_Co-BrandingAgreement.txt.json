Issues related to access to services: Canadian public health care system There is little notion of \"managed care\" in Canada Inclusion of Canadian \"self help\" resources Health related law & policy: Federal and provincial government funding of healthcare and the existence of a social safety net in Canada Allowed distribution of drugs Different roles related to pharmaceutical advertising Societal context of Canada: Canada's multicultural make up (e.g. Less Hispanics, more Asians) Likelihood of different health risk factors for Canadians Different behaviour of the Canadian population (e.g. travelling south for the winter, \"snowbirds\") Different health events e.g. \"Heart month\" Technicalities: Differences in drug names Canadian currency Metric system for measurement The Canadian voice: Important to highlight Canadian health experts e.g. Canadian health professionals, researchers, companies \"local\" events e.g. hospital closures, labour issues",

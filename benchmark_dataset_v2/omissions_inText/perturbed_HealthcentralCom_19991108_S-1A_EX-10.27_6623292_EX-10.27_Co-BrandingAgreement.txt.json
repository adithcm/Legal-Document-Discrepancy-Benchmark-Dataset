                "original_text": "f) ensure that in the event that user traffic to the Co-Branded Site falls below the levels outlined in Schedule 2, that MediaLinx will use all commercially reasonable efforts to increase promotion to the Co-Branded Site until usage to the site increases to levels above the levels outlined in Schedule 2;",
                "changed_text": "f) ensure that in the event that user traffic to the Co-Branded Site falls below acceptable levels, that MediaLinx will use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the Co-Branded Site.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Schedule 2' where traffic levels are precisely defined, and replacing it with 'acceptable levels', the contract becomes ambiguous. Section 2(f) still mandates MediaLinx to act upon low traffic, but now the specific levels triggering this action are undefined, contradicting the original intent of having a measurable metric.",

                "explanation": "Removing all references to schedule '3' creates an omission because the level of Canadian content is now not defined within the co-branding agreement, it has no metric to achieve. This creates a contradiction since it references the need to maintain Canadian content, but not to the originally agreed-upon level.",

                "explanation": "By removing the value from the number of advertising banners run each month, it provides ambiguity on what was originally contracted in the co-branding agreement.

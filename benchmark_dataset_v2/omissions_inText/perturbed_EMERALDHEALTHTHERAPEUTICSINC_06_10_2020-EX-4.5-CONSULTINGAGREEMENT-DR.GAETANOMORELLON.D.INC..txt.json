                "original_text": "3.1 Fee. The Company will pay to the Contractor an annual fee (the \"Fee\") of $240,000. per year plus plus GST and applicable taxes, if any.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 Fee. The Company will pay to the Contractor an annual fee (the \"Fee\") as determined by the Company's board of directors. ",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific annual fee amount, the contract creates ambiguity. Later sections referencing 'the Fee' now lack a concrete value, potentially leading to disputes and hindering enforcement.",

The Company may terminate this Agreement and the Contractor's engagement for Cause at any time on written notice to the Contractor. The date of termination will be the date specified in the written notice and may be, in the sole discretion of the Company, the same day the notice is given to the Contractor, or such later date as the Company may decide.",

                "explanation": "By removing the provision allowing for immediate termination upon notice for cause, the contract now implies that all terminations, even for cause, require some notice period. This contradicts the common understanding of 'termination for cause,' which often allows for immediate dismissal.",

All Confidential Information will, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five years thereafter, be held by the Contractor in a fiduciary capacity for Emerald, in the strictest confidence, and will be used by the Contractor solely for the benefit of Emerald, and will not be used by the Contractor, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than for the benefit of Emerald, nor will the Contractor divulge or communicate, directly or indirectly, such verbally, in writing or otherwise to any party.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of \"Confidential Information\" and keeping only the confidentiality obligations, the contract now lacks clarity on what information is actually protected. This makes the confidentiality clause difficult to enforce, as there is no clear standard to determine what constitutes 'Confidential Information'.",

AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party. If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Approved Use' has been completely removed from the clause, but later sections refer to 'Approved Use.' This creates an ambiguity and an internal contradiction because the contract no longer defines the parameters of acceptable trademark use.  It introduces uncertainty about how AGI can enforce restrictions on trademark use, as the standard is not clearly defined.",

AGI and the Company agree to develop and implement a program for marketing certain products and services offered by AGI through the Good Sam program, including, without limitation, the emergency road service program and the extended warranty program offered through Good Sam. Such marketing program will be on terms acceptable to AGI and the Company and shall be subject to standards and procedures designated by AGI. The terms of the marketing program will be set forth in a marketing agreement between AGI and the Company. The marketing agreement will provide, among other things, the terms pursuant to which the Company shall make \"Fulfillment Deposits\" for warranty products sold as a part of the marketing program.",

                "explanation": "The specific requirement that 'The marketing agreement will provide, among other things, the terms pursuant to which the Company shall make \"Fulfillment Deposits\" for warranty products sold as a part of the marketing program' has been removed.  This is an omission that creates a potential breach of contract with unclear implications. Now, if the marketing agreement does not have the requirements to make fulfillment deposits, there can be a conflict. This undermines the enforceability of potential deposit obligations and raises questions about financial responsibilities if warranty products are sold.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'and the Company agrees not to hold the Business out as having the Endorsement' has been removed. Although AGI can withdraw endorsement, this missing clause removes the explicit constraint on the Company to stop representing it as having the endorsement, undermining AGI's right. This creates ambiguity in enforcement since there isn't a contractual obligation for the company to not hold the business out as endorsed.",

This could lead to Client being responsible for events that were originally tied to TrueLink's breaches under external agreements. The original text limited Client's liability to specific scenarios where TrueLink faced losses due to Client's actions breaching *other* agreements, now its just clients action and an open question for indemnity. This introduces uncertainty as the contract no longer explicitly limits the scope of liability related to actions under System Agreement or Credit Repository Agreement. This directly contradicts with Sections 3(i) and 8(a) and related clauses.",

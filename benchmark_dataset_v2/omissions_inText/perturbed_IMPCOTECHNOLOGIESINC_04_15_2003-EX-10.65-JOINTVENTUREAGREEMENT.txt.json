An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.   \"Agreement\" or \"this Agreement\" shall mean this joint venture Agreement, alongwith all attachments annexed hereto, and shall include any subsequent modifications, alterations and additions and deletions therefrom made in writing after the date of execution of this Agreement.   \"Approval(s)\" shall mean all government, statutory and/or regulatory permissions, consents, validations, confirmations, licenses and any other authorizations required to be obtained in order to implement the provisions of this Agreement including, but not limited to, all necessary approvals of the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.   \"Articles\" or \"Articles of Association\" shall mean the Articles of Association of the MINDA IMPCO Technologies Limited.    \"Alternate Director\" shall mean an Alternate Director appointed in terms of Article 3.7 herein to act for a Director during his absence for a period of not less than three (3) months from the State in which the registered office of the JVC is situated and such Alternate Director shall not hold office as such for a period longer than that permissible to the Director in whose place the Alternate Director has been appointed and shall vacate office when the Director returns to such State.   \"Financial Institutions\" shall mean Indian financial institutions, including but not limited to, ICICI, Industrial Development Bank of India, Industrial Finance Corporation of India and shall also include foreign financial institutions.   \"Joint Venture Company\" or \"the JVC\" shall mean the Indian company to be established and incorporated under the laws of India pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and, subject to the approval of the Registrar of Companies, Delhi and Haryana, with the name \"MINDA IMPCO Technologies Limited\" or such other name as may be agreed by the Parties, with the main object of, inter alia, marketing and selling of alternate fuel management systems, including but not limited to, CNG,",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradiction by simplifying and broadening the definitions of key terms. For example, defining 'Act' as 'any applicable law' removes the specific reference to the Companies Act, 1956, creating uncertainty about which legal framework governs. Later references to 'the Act' become unclear. Similarly, simplifying the definition of 'Affiliates', 'Approvals', and 'Financial Institutions' broadens their scope, making it unclear which specific entities and regulations are included, thus creating the opportunity for disputes regarding compliance and enforcement. Omitting the specific details introduces contradictions by leaving room for interpretation that may conflict with other clauses that still rely on the original specific meanings.",

Out of the minimum number of five (5) Directors, the Parties shall be represented in the ratio of 3 : 2, i.e., three (3) Directors shall be nominated by IMPCO and two (2) Directors shall be nominated by MIL and MINDA The Directors nominated by MINDA and MIL will be referred as MINDA Directors and Directors nominated by IMPCO will be referred as IMPCO Directors. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the representation of MIL/MINDA and IMPCO on the Board of the JVC shall always be maintained in the above mentioned ratio and IMPCO will always have a majority on the board.   It is further agreed that the first four (4 ) Directors of the JVC shall be nominated by IMPCO .",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specific ratio (3:2) for board representation between IMPCO and MIL/MINDA. This omission creates an inconsistency if other sections of the agreement still refer to this ratio when making decisions or allocating responsibilities. It allows for potential disputes over control and management of the JVC, as the previously defined majority control of IMPCO is now uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for price determination and only using 'the fair market price', uncertainty is added in how the price would be determined and create disputes regarding the method of valuation. This is a contradiction because Article 15.2 references to this section for pricing, and previously it states that Article 15.3 can determine pricing based on Government Regulations which creates confusion if the pricing determined by Government Regulations is more or less than the fair market value.",

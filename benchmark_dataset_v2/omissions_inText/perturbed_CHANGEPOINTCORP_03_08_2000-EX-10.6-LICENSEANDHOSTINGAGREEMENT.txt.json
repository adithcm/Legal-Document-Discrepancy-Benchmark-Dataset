Corio shall be responsible for providing its          Customers with routine technical support of the Software (Levels 1 and          2) as described in the schedule set forth in EXHIBIT C hereto.

The contract still requires support but the specific details and costs become unclear which generates uncertainty in how the support is actually handled, creating internal inconsistency. This affects enforceability because the standards are not clearly articulated and makes references to revenue inconsistent. It makes the levels undefined and its duration and payment terms absent.",

This pricing formula          shall apply for each calendar year during the term of this Agreement          which Corio has distribution rights under this Section 2.5. For those          Corio Customers who purchase Changepoint Software licenses from Corio          pursuant to this Section 2.5 and Changepoint's Distribution Agreement,          Corio shall pay to Changepoint a Software Support and Maintenance fee          equal to *** of Changepoint's standard support and          maintenance services for the Software Support and Maintenance services          provided by Changepoint as specified in Section 5.3 of this Agreement          and EXHIBIT C attached hereto and made a part hereof, and for Updates          and Upgrades.

While a Distribution License is still referenced and says Corio has the right to resell, without those key parameters, enforcing financial obligations becomes problematic. The mention of a 'standard distribution agreement' without specifying what these terms are conflicts with the agreement's language, which claims this agreement controls, generating inconsistencies and makes it ambiguous.",

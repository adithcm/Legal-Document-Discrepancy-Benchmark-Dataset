                "original_text": "Section 2.05 Economic Terms. The Company and the Lessor hereby agree that Schedules entered into pursuant to this Agency Agreement shall conform with the following \"Economic Terms\":\n\n1. Maximum Aggregate Capitalized Lessor's Cost:  $14,500,000.00\n\n2. Basic Term Lease Rate Factor:  To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor\n\n3.

                "explanation": "By changing 'To be mutually agreed upon by Company and Lessor' to 'To be determined by Lessor' for 'Basic Term Lease Rate Factor' and 'Equipment Type', the clause creates an internal contradiction with Section 2.01. Section 2.01 states that the equipment to be leased must be in accordance with 'Economic Terms', implying joint agreement, but this modification allows the Lessor to unilaterally determine crucial economic aspects, undermining the initial understanding of mutual agreement and creating ambiguity for enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'as may from time to time be', the changed text now suggests the power and authority vested to the Company can *only* be modified at the time of agreement, rather than ongoing. However, in section 3.01 (c), it states: 'Any termination under this Section 3.01 shall automatically result in the immediate revocation of all authority vested in the Company under this Agreement to order, accept or pay for any Equipment on behalf of Lessor.' This clause refers to an ongoing modification of authority, and directly conflicts with the 'one-time modification' introduced in Section 1.01.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor in its sole discretion', the clause removes the Lessor's right to reject Purchase Documentation not to their satisfaction. This creates a contradiction, as section 1.01 states that all of the power and authority vested to the Company herein shall be subject to any modifications as may from time to time be made by Lessor. The ability to reject payments based on satisfaction of Purchase Documentation would indicate such power and authority. Removing this contradicts section 1.01, as well as creating uncertainty for enforcing payment.",

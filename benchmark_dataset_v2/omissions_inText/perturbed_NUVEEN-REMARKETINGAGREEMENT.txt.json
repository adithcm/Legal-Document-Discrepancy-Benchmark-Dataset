For the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder, the Fund shall pay to the Remarketing Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) a monthly fee for each MFP Share Outstanding on the first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment), in an amount, rounded upward to the nearest dollar, equal to (a) the product of (i) the rate of compensation as then in effect, as shall be agreed upon from time to time in writing by the Fund and the Remarketing Agent, times $[‚óè] multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days from and including such first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment) to and including the last calendar day of such preceding calendar month or, if applicable, the date of termination of this Agreement, if earlier, or the date of any prior redemption or liquidation for such share (as the case may be), divided by (b) 360. The obligation of the Fund to make the payments required by this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect until all such payments shall have been made in full.",

This creates an internal contradiction because this removes the agreed upon calculation, and creates uncertainty in enforcement, leaving the exact fee amount undefined.",

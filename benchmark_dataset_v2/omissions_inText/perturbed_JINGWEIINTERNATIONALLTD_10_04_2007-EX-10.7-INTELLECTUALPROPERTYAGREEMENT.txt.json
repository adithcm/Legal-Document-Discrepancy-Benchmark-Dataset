                "original_text": "Party B agrees to pay Party A the Intellectual Property License fees (the \"License Fees\") and the specified amount of the license fees and the form of payment are set forth in Appendix 2. Party A has the right to exempt the obligation of payment or adjust the amount of the License Fees set forth in Appendix 2 according to the actual circumstances from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "Party B agrees to pay Party A the Intellectual Property License fees (the \"License Fees\"). Party A has the right to exempt the obligation of payment from time to time.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Appendix 2, the contract no longer clearly defines the amount of license fees or the form of payment. The statement 'Party B agrees to pay License Fees' becomes ambiguous because the financial commitments are not clearly detailed, although Appendix 2 is still mentioned elsewhere, creating a contradiction. It also removes Party A's right to adjust the amount of fees, potentially conflicting with future actions.",

                "explanation": "The omission removes Party B's commitment to not query the copyright or any rights of Party A in connection with the Intellectual Property. While Party B is still restricted from performing harmful actions, the altered text makes the agreement ambiguous concerning Party B's rights to question or challenge Party A's intellectual property rights, an action potentially not 'harmful'.",

                "changed_text": "Appendices may be referred to in this agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing the mandatory tone of the original sentence with an indicative one, it eliminates the guarantee that the Appendices are an integral part of the agreement and thus removes its validity. This alteration introduces ambiguity and potentially creates a contradiction if other sections rely on Appendices to enforce specific terms, while at the same time it is not guaranteed that those sections have any validity.",

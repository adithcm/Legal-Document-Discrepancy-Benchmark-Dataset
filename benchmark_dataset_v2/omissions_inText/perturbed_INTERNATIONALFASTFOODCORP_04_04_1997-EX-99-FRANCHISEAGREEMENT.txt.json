The contract still mentions a franchise fee, but its amount and terms of payment/refund are undefined. This contradicts Schedule 1 if it specifies those details, making the contract internally inconsistent.",

Each policy will name BKC, and its subsidiaries,  affiliated and parent companies as an additional insured, and will provide hat the policy  cannot be canceled  without  thirty (30) days prior written notice to BKC, will insure against the liability of BKC for both its and Franchisee's  acts or omissions,  and will insure the  contractual  liability of Franchisee  under paragraph 13.3  Additionally,  Franchisee  agrees to carry, at Franchisee's  expense,  umbrella coverage in an amount which is at all times the equivalent  of One  Million  U.S.  Dollars  (U.S.  $1,000,000)  over  the  basic Comprehensive  General  Liability  insurance  per  restaurant;  except  that  if Franchisee  owns  more  than ten (10)  Burger  King  Restaurants,  the  umbrella coverage applicable to all such restaurants need not exceed an mount which is at any  time  in  excess  of the  equivalent  of Ten  Million  U.S.  Dollars  (U.S. $10,000,000).

                "explanation": "By removing the specific insurance coverage amounts (e.g., $1,000,000 for bodily injury) and umbrella coverage details, the modified text introduces ambiguity. The franchisee is still required to have insurance, but the *required amount is no longer defined*. This creates inconsistency if other sections rely on these specific coverage amounts or if compliance is later assessed.",

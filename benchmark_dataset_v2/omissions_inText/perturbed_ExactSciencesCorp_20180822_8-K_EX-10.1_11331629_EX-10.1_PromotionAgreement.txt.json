                "explanation": "By removing 'approved', 'prescription', and 'subject to pre-market approval (or other regulatory approval, as applicable)' the definition of promotion is now inconsistent and allows for broader interpretation. This contradicts other sections of the contract that specify promotion must comply with FDA regulations, which are specific to prescription devices. This creates uncertainty because the definition is no longer explicitly limited to FDA-approved uses, implying promotion can target non-approved uses, creating an in-text contradiction and uncertainty for enforcement.",

Commencing on the Launch Date, each of Exact and Pfizer shall implement the sales Detailing plan set forth in the applicable Annual Marketing Plan and the Sales Deployment Plan. In the case of Pfizer, Pfizer shall ensure that (i) the number of Details in a Calendar Year by Pfizer Sales Representatives is not less than six hundred twenty-five thousand (625,000) Details (for the remainder of 2018 Calendar Year following the Launch Date, Pfizer shall deliver one hundred forty thousand (140,000) Details) and (ii) if the Product is Promoted by Pfizer Sales Representatives (A) in position 2 or higher, the Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product shall not be less than thirty percent (30%) of Incentive Compensation available to be earned by such Sales Representative in the applicable Calendar Quarter and (B) in position 3 or lower, the Incentive Compensation weighting directly tied to the Product shall not be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of Incentive Compensation available to be earned by such Sales Representative in the applicable Calendar Quarter. If Pfizer delivers less than five hundred sixty-two thousand five hundred (562,500) Details in a Calendar Year, then the Promotion Fee due Pfizer for such Calendar Year shall be reduced by the applicable percentage set forth in the table on Exhibit 3.4(a), with such reduction to be deducted from remittance of the Promotion Fee for the last Calendar Quarter of such Calendar Year; provided that if such deduction exceeds the amount payable for such Calendar Quarter then Exact shall apply any such remaining deduction to the Promotion Fee for the next Calendar Quarter or Calendar Quarters, as necessary until the total deduction has been applied. If Pfizer delivers less than four hundred fifty thousand (450,000) Details in a Calendar Year, in addition to percentage reduction of the Promotion Fee set forth in the table on Exhibit 3.4(a), Exact shall have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.3(b), which termination shall not be subject to the right of Pfizer to cure such breach. In no event shall Pfizer owe any monies to Exact for Detail shortfalls under this Agreement other than to refund the Promotion Fee owed to Exact due to Detail shortfall in accordance with this Section 3.4(a). Each Party shall be responsible for its own Sales Representatives costs attributable to the Product, including base salary and Incentive Compensation, normal travel and entertainment expenses, cost of fleet vehicles and other expenses normally associated with Promotion of products and services similar to the Product.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements for Pfizer's detailing efforts (number of details, incentive compensation weighting) and the associated penalties for not meeting these targets, but leaving the general statement that each party is responsible for its own sales representative costs, an in-text contradiction is created. The contract still references a 'detailing plan,' but eliminates the specific obligations and penalties associated with that plan for Pfizer. This introduces uncertainty because it is unclear what recourse Exact has if Pfizer doesn't adequately detail the product, and it is inconsistent with references to Details elsewhere in the agreement.",

From the Launch Date and ending on the last day of the next Calendar Quarter and each subsequent Calendar Quarter during the Term, Exact shall owe Pfizer a service fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the product of: Laboratory Service Revenue minus Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue (\"Incremental Laboratory Service Revenue\") for the Calendar Quarter multiplied by Gross Margin Percent for the Calendar Quarter (such product, the \"Promotion Fee\"). In no event shall the Gross Margin Percent used in the calculation of the Promotion Fee be less than sixty-eight percent (68%) or more than seventy-four percent (74%). The calculation of the Promotion Fee pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) is subject to Section 4.2(c) below. Promotion Fee(s) and all compensation paid by Exact to Pfizer under this Agreement, even where calculated as a percentage of sales, is intended to compensate Pfizer a fair market value for the entirety of services that Pfizer is providing to Exact hereunder. The formula for the calculation of the Promotion Fee is as follows:\nA = Laboratory Service Revenue\nB = Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue\nC = Gross Margin Percent\nPromotion Fee = 0.5 * (A-B) * C\n(b) Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue. The chart below sets forth the Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue for the Product for each Calendar Year during the Term (the \"Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue\"). In the Annual Marketing Plan the appropriate Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue shall be allocated among each Calendar Quarter during such Calendar Year, taking into consideration seasonality or other sales demand variables. For 2018, the first Calendar Quarter shall be from the Launch Date to December 31, 2018 and the Calendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue allocated to that Calendar Quarter shall be $130 million.\nCalendar Year Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue\n2018 $441 million\n2019 $622 million\n2020 $861 million\n2021 $1.191 billion\n(c) Supplemental Promotion Fee.\n(i) Subject to Pfizer's compliance with Sections 3.4(a)(i) and 3.4(a)(ii), (A) Exact shall pay Pfizer the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of the Promotion Fee incurred by Exact to Pfizer during the remainder of 2018 Calendar Year and 2019 Calendar Year (the \"First Promotion Fee Period\") is less than $37.5 million (the \"First Supplemental Promotion Fee\"), and (B) Exact shall pay Pfizer the amount, if any, by which the aggregate Promotion Fee incurred by Exact to Pfizer during each of Calendar Year 2020 and 2021 is less than $30 million (\"Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee\"), in each case to compensate Pfizer for the sales, Marketing and other performance provided by Pfizer under this Agreement.\n(ii) As of June 30 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate a partial-period amount to be paid toward the potential First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the potential Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be. With regard to the First Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for 2018, and the first six (6) months of Calendar Year 2019, is less than $22.5 million, and with regard to each Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, the partial-period payment shall be equal to the amount by which the Promotion Fee for the six-month (6-month) period through June 30 is less than $15 million.\n(iii) As of December 31 of each Calendar Year during the Term, Exact shall calculate the First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, for the entirety of the applicable period. Exact shall pay Pfizer the First Supplemental Promotion Fee or the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee, as the case may be, if any, less any partial-period payment made by Exact during the applicable period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii).\n(iv) To the extent the amount of the Promotion Fee for the First Promotion Fee Period exceeds the First Supplemental Promotion Fee, Exact shall be entitled to a credit of such excess amount up to the amount of any partial-period payment made by Exact during such First Promotion Fee Period pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii), and Exact shall apply such credit toward the Promotion Fee payment due Pfizer for the fourth Calendar Quarter of 2019 (or due for subsequent Calendar Quarters until such credit is fully exhausted). To the extent the amount of the Promotion Fee for any Calendar Year after 2019 exceeds the Annual Supplemental Promotion Fee for such Calendar Year, Exact shall be entitled to a credit of such excess amount up to the amount of any partial-period payment made by Exact during such Calendar Year pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(ii), and Exact shall apply such credit toward the Promotion Fee payment due Pfizer for the fourth Calendar Quarter of such Calendar Year (or due for subsequent Calendar Quarters until such credit is fully exhausted).\n(v) Any amounts due under Sections 4.2(c)(i) and (ii) shall be payable within thirty (30) days after each of June 30 , and December 31  of each Calendar Year, beginning with June 30, 2019, as applicable.",

                "explanation": "By removing the formula for calculating the promotion fee, the Baseline Laboratory Service Revenue chart, and the details regarding the supplemental promotion fee, but keeping the general statement that Exact owes Pfizer a service fee for the services provided, an in-text contradiction is created. The contract references a 'service fee', but no mechanism or amount is provided. This creates significant uncertainty regarding how much Exact owes Pfizer and under what circumstances, especially since the supplemental fee is removed. This makes Section 4.2 unenforceable, and the contradiction with other sections related to payments creates ambiguity.",

The fee shall be equal to 5.2% of the \"gross proceeds\" received in the Offering attributable to the efforts of the Agent. At least 48 hours prior to each Closing, the Agent shall deliver a schedule, identified as Appendix A, that lists each investor and the amount of investment.",

                "explanation": "The specific fee percentage (5.2%) is removed, and the determination of the fee is now at the Company's discretion. However, Appendix A is still mentioned, creating a contradiction. The original contract defined that Appendix A should contain the amount of investment. By removing this definition, it causes uncertainty as the contract refers to a process without clearly stating how payment will be defined, making enforcement ambiguous.",

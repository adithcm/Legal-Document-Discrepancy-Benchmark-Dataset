                "explanation": "By removing the clause regarding the refund by the Escrow Agent, while still referencing the 'Escrow Agent (as defined below)', creates a contradiction. Section 5 also defines Escrow Agent. If the offering fails, it's unclear whether investors are entitled to a refund, creating uncertainty in enforcement, and the existence of the Escrow Agent is only in this sentence.",

                "original_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until March 31, 2008.",
                "changed_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, the rights granted herein will continue in full force and effect according to a schedule determined by Fox.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specified end date of March 31, 2008 for certain properties and replacing it with 'a schedule determined by Fox', the amendment creates uncertainty regarding the license duration. Other clauses referencing the 'Term' now lack a concrete endpoint for those properties, contradicting the initial definition of 'Term' ending December 31, 2006, and making enforcement unclear. This gives Fox unilateral power to define when these licensed properties can be exploited, causing contractual imbalance.",

                "changed_text": "NOTICE PROVISION: The notice information for Licensee in Section 17(a) of the Agreement shall be amended such that \"Paul Zuzelo\" is deleted and replaced with \"General Counsel\".",
                "explanation": "By removing the deletion of Paul Zuzelo's email address, the amendment now contains contradictory information. Section 17(a) may still have Paul Zuzeloâ€™s email listed as a valid contact, while the amendment suggests all communications go to the General Counsel. This creates confusion regarding where official notices should be sent, potentially leading to missed communications and contractual breaches due to incorrect notification.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'or by necessary implication modified by this Amendment', the text creates a contradiction. Previously, unspoken modifications were acceptable, but now every amendment has to be expressly stated. This would lead to contractual issues as there is uncertainty about how other sections will be interpreted.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,' removes the legal basis for the joint filing agreement. While the agreement still refers to a joint filing, the specific SEC rule that governs this type of filing is not mentioned, creating ambiguity about the legal standard to which the agreement is subject. This creates uncertainty regarding the obligations and liabilities under securities regulations.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement,' there is no clause defining if all counterparts constitute one agreement. This creates uncertainty for enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'Title: General Counsel' from the signature blocks of several entities introduces uncertainty about the authority of the signatory, David A. Marple. While the signature is present, the absence of the title makes it ambiguous whether he is signing on behalf of the entity and if he has the legal authority to bind the entity to the agreement. This omission creates doubts about the enforceability of the agreement as it relates to those entities.",

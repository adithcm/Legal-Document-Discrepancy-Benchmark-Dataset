The terms for  compensation and expenses for these additional FTEs will be as provided for the original FTEs in Section 2.2.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2.2 of the Development Agreement is hereby amended to allow Cargill at its sole discretion to apply additional resources to perform the Work Plan. The terms for compensation and expenses for these resources will be determined separately.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific reference to '[***]' creates uncertainty. While the modified text still refers to compensation and expenses, it lacks the specific link to the original terms, contradicting the implied continuation of those terms. Additionally, the phrase 'determined separately' contradicts the earlier statement that the terms will be 'as provided for the original FTEs'.",

This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to convert the facilities to solely use CB1 and the reference to Section 5.9 of the Commercial License, the amendment creates a contradiction. The original intent was for Bioamber to convert its plants, according to pre-established economic obligations. Without these clauses, Bioamber's obligations become ambiguous, and the purpose of the new section 13.10 is less clear. Furthermore, since in the previous sections, the economic obligations where very clear, this new vague statement creates conflict",

Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.\" Nothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to replace MCC-17 and Bioamber's current E. coli strain with CB1 in all the  existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the  Commercial License.",
                "changed_text": "\"Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for new strains. Nothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to replace existing strains in the existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'CB1 Strain' specifically and the removal of 'according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Commercial License' creates ambiguity. The original text clearly defines which strain is being focused on and references a specific section detailing the process of replacement. The modified text removes these specifics, making Bioamber's obligation less defined. Without the direct reference to CB1, the 'new strains' language is open to interpretation, potentially conflicting with other clauses that heavily rely on CB1 implementation, therefore it adds an internal contradiction to the text.",

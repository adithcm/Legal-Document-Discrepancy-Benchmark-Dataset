                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall use reasonable efforts to ensure filings are made. Each party is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information it provides, but makes no warranties regarding information provided by others.",
                "explanation": "Removing the explicit responsibility for 'timely filing' and replacing it with 'reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity. While responsibility for their own information remains, removing the direct statement that they are 'not responsible' for others creates uncertainty about the extent of their liability if another party's information is inaccurate. Other sections referencing joint responsibility are now contradicted.",

                "changed_text": "The parties intend that this Joint Filing Agreement may be included as an exhibit to such statement and any amendment.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'agree' to 'intend' significantly weakens the obligation to include the Joint Filing Agreement as an exhibit. Other sections might rely on the assumption that this agreement *will* be included, creating a contradiction if it is not. This introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability.",

                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in separate documents.",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument,' the legal validity and unified nature of the agreement when signed across multiple documents is put into question. If other sections assume a single, unified document, this change introduces a contradiction and potential challenges to enforcing the agreement as a whole.",

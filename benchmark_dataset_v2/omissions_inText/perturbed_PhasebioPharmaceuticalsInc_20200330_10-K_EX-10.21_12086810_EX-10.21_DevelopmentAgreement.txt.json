                "original_text": "1.1.42 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): reasonable, diligent, good-faith efforts to accomplish such objective which are consistent with industry standards for companies of comparable size as that of such Party. \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" requires, with respect to a particular task or activity in making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, exporting, developing (including seeking regulatory approvals or applicable pricing or reimbursement approvals) or otherwise commercializing the Product, that a Party: (i) promptly assign responsibility for such task or activity to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis; (ii) set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such task or activity; and (iii) make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives in accordance with established timelines; provided, however, that, to the extent that the performance of a Party's obligations hereunder is adversely affected by the other Party's breach in performing its obligations hereunder, the impact on the first Party of such performance failure by the other Party will be taken into account in determining whether the first Party has used its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to perform any such affected obligations.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.42 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means efforts deemed reasonable by a Party's internal management team.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the detailed requirements for 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' such as assigning responsibility, setting specific objectives, and allocating resources according to established timelines. The modified definition introduces ambiguity, as it's unclear what criteria the internal management team will use to deem efforts reasonable. This contradicts later sections that rely on the original, more specific definition for evaluating a party's performance. For example, Section 2.3.1 requires the Parties to use 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' to complete each activity specified on the Timeline. Under the original definition, this would be assessed by the detailed requirements outlined. However, under the modified definition, a Party could argue that their efforts were reasonable based on internal management's assessment, even if they didn't meet the specific requirements of assigning responsibility, setting objectives, or allocating resources effectively. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because it is unclear what the parties will adhere to when enforcing.",

                "explanation": "By removing the provision about approving budgets, the modified text contradicts the original intent and creates ambiguity regarding who is responsible for the budget. This conflicts with Section 4.1, which states that SFJ will be obligated to pay or incur up to One Hundred Twenty Million U.S. Dollars ($120,000,000.00) of Development Costs and Section 4.2, which addresses the 'Funding Schedule.' By removing the text from the responsibilities of JDC, it is unclear who oversees the approval of funding. This creates uncertainty in enforcement and financial oversight.",

PB shall not, without SFJ's prior written consent, create, incur, assume, or be liable for any Indebtedness, or permit any subsidiary of PB to do so, other than Permitted Indebtedness.\n\n7.5.2 Subordinated Debt. PB shall not (a) make or permit any payment on any Subordinated Debt, except to the extent permitted by the terms of the subordination, intercreditor, or other similar agreement to which such Subordinated Debt is subject, or (b) amend any provision in any document relating to Subordinated Debt which would provide for earlier or greater principal, interest, or other cash payments thereon, or materially adversely affect the subordination thereof to PB Obligations owed to SFJ.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the specific restrictions on PB incurring indebtedness and managing subordinated debt, including the need for SFJ's prior written consent and the limitations on amending provisions related to subordinated debt. This contradicts Section 7.2, which states that the security interest granted to SFJ shall be and shall at all times thereafter continue to be a first- priority perfected security interest in the SFJ Collateral. By removing the negative covenants, PB could incur indebtedness that impairs SFJ's security interest, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

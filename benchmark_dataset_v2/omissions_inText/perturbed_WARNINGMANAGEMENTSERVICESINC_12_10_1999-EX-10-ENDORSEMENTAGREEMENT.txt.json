As used herein, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: (a) \"Contract Period\" shall mean that period of time commencing as of May 31, 1999 and concluding May 31, 2000.

(d) \"Endorsed Products\" shall mean all Products of Company which have the Manning Identification (defined below) highlighted as a part thereof (in the Products' name or otherwise) or which are shipped in containers or packages bearing the Manning Identification. (e) \"Manning Identification\" shall mean any words or symbols or photographic or graphic representations or combinations thereof which identify Manning such as, for example, the name and likeness of Manning. (f) \"Premium Program\" shall mean any traffic builder, third party tie-in program or other program involving the use of a premium and shall include any program primarily designed to attract the consumer to purchase a product or service other than Endorsed Products themselves.

(c) \"Contract Year Quarter\" shall mean each 3 consecutive month period occurring during any Contract Year.

The original definitions provided specific parameters, while the modified versions introduce ambiguity, particularly regarding duration, location, scope of endorsement, and product types. This creates an internal contradiction as other sections rely on the removed specific details to dictate obligations and rights.",

Except for the advertising of merchandise related to the Endorsed Products and/or the Manning Identification, no other use of the back panel of each box of Endorsed Products is permitted without Pey Dirt's prior written consent. It is agreed that all such merchandise must be mutually approved in all respects by the parties hereto, including, without limitation, the style, design and cost thereof. (d) In addition to and separate from any other remuneration hereunder, if Company uses any performance or service of Manning hereunder in any way that is subject to the jurisdiction of any applicable artists' union, guild or other organization (including, without limitation, SAG and AFTRA), either during or after the Contract Period, Company shall pay directly to such organization all minimum payments or fees (for benefit plans or otherwise) required to be made with respect to Manning's performance or services.

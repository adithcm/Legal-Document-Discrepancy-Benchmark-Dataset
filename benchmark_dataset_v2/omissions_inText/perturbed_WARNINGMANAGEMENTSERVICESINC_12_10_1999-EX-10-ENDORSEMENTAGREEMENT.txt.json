During the Contract Period, Company shall supply Pey Dirt and/or its agent with such amounts of Endorsed Products as Pey Dirt and/or its agent may reasonably request. Company agrees to pay all charges in connection with the delivery of Endorsed Products to Pey Dirt and/or Pey Dirt's agent, including shipping charges, air freight charges and customs charges. Company agrees to reimburse Pey Dirt's authorized agent for all such expenses incurred by it in connection with the transfer of Endorsed Products to Pey Dirt and/or Pey Dirt's agent.",
                "changed_text": "Products for the Use of Pey Dirt. During the Contract Period, Company shall supply Pey Dirt and/or its agent with Endorsed Products. Specific quantities and delivery terms will be determined through a separate agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause obligating Company to pay all delivery-related charges, and vaguely referring to a 'separate agreement,' a contradiction is introduced. Section 4 may imply that Company pays royalties based on gross shipments, but now they might argue that delivery costs affect those shipments, creating ambiguity.",

If Company desires to utilize the services of Manning as a model in connection with photographs or drawings for advertising or for personal appearances, Pey Dirt agrees, at the reasonable request of Company and upon adequate notice, to provide the services of Manning at a time and place reasonably convenient to the schedule of Manning. Company agrees that it will reimburse Pey Dirt for reasonable travel (including first class air fare), lodging, ground transportation and meal expenses incurred by Manning and one traveling companion designated by Manning.  Company further agrees it will reimburse Pey Dirt's authorized agent for reasonable travel (including air fare), lodging and meal expenses incurred in providing one representative to accompany Manning.  Company understands that if services are requested hereunder, such services may be coordinated with similar services for others entitled to the use of Manning Identification in other connections.  Company further understands that such services may be required not more than once during the Contract Period for up to one (1) hour. In the event that Company elects to use the services of Manning in connection with television advertising, Company shall make all required union scale and union pension and welfare payments.  Company further understands that failure to utilize services of Manning pursuant to this section shall not result in any reduction in payments to Pey Dirt hereunder, nor may the obligation to provide services be carried past the Contract Period.  The obligations of Pey Dirt to provide the services of Manning hereunder are subject to the condition that payments to Pey Dirt are current and up to date.",
                "changed_text": "Services of Manning. If Company desires to utilize the services of Manning as a model in connection with advertising or for personal appearances, Pey Dirt agrees to consider providing such services. The provision of these services is at Pey Dirt's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific details regarding reimbursement for travel, lodging, and meal expenses, a contradiction is introduced. The original section outlined a clear payment structure, whereas now there is no mention. This contradicts the general expectation set in other clauses about financial obligations. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over costs if Manning's services are used.",

In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Nashville, Tennessee. Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness designated by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details regarding arbitration rules, location, and discovery, a significant ambiguity is created. The original section clearly outlined arbitration procedures. Now, Pey Dirt can unilaterally choose any method of dispute resolution, potentially contradicting expectations of fairness. For example, a different section, such as 'Governing Law,' might imply standard legal proceedings, now undermined by this open-ended clause.",

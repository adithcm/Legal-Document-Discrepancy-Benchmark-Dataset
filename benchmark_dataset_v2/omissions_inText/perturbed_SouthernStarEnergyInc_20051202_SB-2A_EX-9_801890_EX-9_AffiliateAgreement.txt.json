                "original_text": "§ 6 Advertising Cost Compensation (1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element 5 for the respective Software Source: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005 Publisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing, so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met (\"agreements arising in a qualified manner\"). Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by removing key specifics related to VAT, qualified agreements, compensation calculation, payment methods, and thresholds. The removal of specifics contradicts the general statement that advertising costs will be paid, as the exact conditions and amounts are now undefined, leading to uncertainty in enforcement. It also reduces the amount paid and loosens restrictions for element 5, which favors them.",

                "explanation": "By removing the e-mail notification requirement and the objection period, element 5 can unilaterally change the terms without providing sufficient notice or opportunity for the Affiliate and Software Publisher to contest them. This contradicts the implied fairness and mutual agreement in a contract, making the modification process unfair and potentially unenforceable. It also reduces the work element 5 must put in.",

The Affiliate guarantees in particular that (i) It will integrate advertising Material according to the provisions and instructions of the Software Publisher into that Affiliate's Web site insofar as said Material was transferred to the Affiliate; (ii) The material used the Affiliate's Web site will not contain any representations of violence, sexually related contents or discriminatory statements or representations with regard to race, sex, religion, nationality, handicap, sexual preference and orientation, or age, nor will said Material be unlawful in any way; (iii) The Material used on the Affiliate's homepage will not infringe upon the rights of third parties, particularly patents, copyrights, trademarks or other commercial protection rights as well as general personality rights and cannot be mistaken for the products of the Software Publisher and/or element 5 or a Web site operated by the Software Publisher and/or element 5; (iv) It will not send any e-mail without the express Source: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005 consent of the receiver(s) (no spam e-mails).

                "explanation": "By removing the specific guarantees regarding content, the contract lacks clarity on acceptable website content, potentially contradicting a general clause about website responsibility. Removing detailed examples of prohibited material creates uncertainty about what constitutes a violation, making enforcement subjective and harder for the Affiliate to adhere to. The removal of specifics also reduces the protection of users.",

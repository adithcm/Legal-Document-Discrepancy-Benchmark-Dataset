Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"proving that all requirements are irrevocably met ('agreements arising in a qualified manner')\" and related phrases, the criteria for a 'qualified' agreement is eliminated, creating ambiguity about when Advertising Cost Compensation is actually earned. Also, the removal of 'including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.' from subsection (4) introduces uncertainty about the base value used for compensation calculation. By removing the detail about end users payment requirements and 'charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs' in subsection (5) brings more amiguity to sales that are compensated.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause '(iv) It will not send any e-mail without the express consent of the receiver(s) (no spam e-mails)', there is no longer a prohibition against sending unsolicited emails. This is an omission that creates uncertainty in enforcement since without the requirement to gain consent of emails, there is a potential legal issue from affiliates for unrequested emails. This omission weakens the guarantees and creates ambiguity about the affiliate's responsibilities regarding email marketing.",

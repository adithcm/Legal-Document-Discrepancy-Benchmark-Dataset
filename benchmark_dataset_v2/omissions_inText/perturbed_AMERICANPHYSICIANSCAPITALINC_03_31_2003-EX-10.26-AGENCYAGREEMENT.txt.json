                "original_text": "E.       AGENCY'S ERRORS AND OMISSION, AND FIDELITY & ELECTRONIC CRIME INSURANCE\n\n         The Agency will maintain valid errors and omissions insurance, with          minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident, and a fidelity and          electronic crime policy through an insurer, both of which shall contain          terms and limits of coverage acceptable to MICOA covering the Agency's          solicitors and each of its employees. The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes the specific requirement for minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident for errors and omissions insurance, and the requirement that policy terms be acceptable to MICOA. This introduces ambiguity and could lead to a situation where the agency obtains inadequate coverage, which could contradict implied expectations within the agreement regarding adequate risk mitigation.",

In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason,                   MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to                   sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.                   In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.",

In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason,                   MICOA agrees to negotiate with Agency, regarding Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to sell to MICOA' to 'MICOA agrees to negotiate with Agency,' the contract removes the obligation to purchase expirations. However, the clause stating that the agency cannot sell insurance to MICOA insureds after termination still exists, which implies that MICOA is providing some compensation (that is no longer defined), creating an enforceable contradiction. The contract indicates that expirations will be considered, but compensation parameters are removed. Also, the phrase \"The purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.\" was removed.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase \"for which a commission is specified in the schedule of commissions provided by Exhibit A, attached and as amended or supplemented by such attachments from time to time\" creates an issue when cross referencing Exhibit A. Without a commission schedule, the agency's compensation is undefined, creating an issue and a lack of a financial incentive for agency to want to make the sales.",

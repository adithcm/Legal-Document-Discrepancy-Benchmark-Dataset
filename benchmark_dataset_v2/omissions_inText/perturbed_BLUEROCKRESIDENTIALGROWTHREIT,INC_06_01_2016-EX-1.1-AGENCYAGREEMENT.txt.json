                "explanation": "The original text provides specific definitions for key terms such as \"430B Information\", \"Settlement Date\", \"Exchange Act\", and \"Hazardous Materials\", grounding the contract in specific legal and regulatory contexts. The modified version removes these specific definitions and replaces them with vague, general ones. This creates an in-text contradiction because later sections of the contract rely on the precise definitions. For instance, Section 3 references \"Settlement Date\" as defined earlier, but now the definition is missing, creating uncertainty in enforcement. Similarly, warranties and representations about compliance with \"Environmental Law\" become ambiguous without a clear definition of what this entails.",

The Transaction Entities and each of their respective subsidiaries maintain (A) effective internal controls over financial reporting (as defined under Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) and (B) a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. Except as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the end of the Company's most recent audited fiscal year, there has been (i) no material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and (ii) no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Other than as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the date of the most recent balance sheet of the Company reviewed or audited by the Company's accountants, (i) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Board\") has not been advised of (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the ability of the Company to record, process, summarize and report financial data, or any material weaknesses in internal controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the internal controls of the Company, and (ii) there have been no significant changes in internal controls over financial reporting that has materially affected the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a detailed representation about the existence and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, referencing specific rules under the Exchange Act and GAAP. It also warrants the absence of material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. The modified clause is vague and aspirational. It contradicts the detailed representation because it removes any specific assurance about the effectiveness or design of the internal controls, creating uncertainty about compliance and potential liability. Other sections relying on effective internal controls now become questionable.",

(\"FINRA\") of the Offered Shares (including filing fees and the fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent relating to such review), (C) costs and expenses of legal counsel for the Agent incurred in connection with this Agreement and the offering of the Offered Shares not to exceed $35,000, (D) costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations and any road show in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Shares, if any, including, without limitation, (1) any travel expenses of the Company's officers and employees and (2) any other expenses of the Company, including all actually and reasonably incurred costs and expenses of the Agent advanced on behalf of the Company relating to the investor presentations and any roadshow in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Shares, (E) the fees and expenses incident to listing the Offered Shares and Conversion Shares on the NYSE MKT, (F) expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) to the Agent, (G) expenses incurred for preparing, printing and distributing any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses to investors or prospective investors, (H) stamp duties, similar taxes or duties or other similar fees or charges, if any, incurred by the Agent in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Shares;  provided,  however that the Transaction Entities shall have no obligation to pay any costs and expenses of the Agent relating to the investor presentations and any roadshow in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Shares, other than costs and expenses advanced on behalf of the Company in accordance with (D) above.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies in detail what expenses the Transaction Entities will cover, including filing fees, FINRA review costs, legal counsel fees, and expenses related to investor presentations. The modified clause replaces this with a vague commitment to cover \"certain expenses related to the offering, as agreed upon separately,\" with details to be found in a nonexistent \"Appendix B.\" This omission creates a contradiction because without the specified expenses, the other sections of the contract that mention or rely on these expense allocations become unenforceable and raise ambiguity about which party is responsible for which cost. The reference to Appendix B, which does not exist, makes it impossible to determine which expenses are covered.",

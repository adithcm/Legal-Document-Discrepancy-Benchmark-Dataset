UTK shall not divulge to others, any trade secret or confidential information, knowledge, or data concerning or pertaining to the business and affairs of AVDU, obtained by UTK as a result of its engagement hereunder, unless authorized, in writing by AVDU. UTK represents and warrants that it has established appropriate internal procedures for protecting the trade secrets and confidential information of AVDU, including, without limitation, restrictions on disclosure of such information to employees and other persons who may be engaged in such information to employees and other persons who may be engaged in rendering services to any person, firm or entity which may be a competitor of AVDU.\n\n  B. AVDU shall not divulge to others, any trade secret or confidential information, knowledge, or data concerning or pertaining to the business and affairs of UTK or confidential information revealed by UTK obtained as a result of its engagement hereunder, unless authorized, in writing, by UTK.\n\n\n\nC. UTK shall not be required in the performance of its duties to divulge to AVDU, or any officer, director, agent or employee of AVDU, any secret or confidential information, knowledge, or data concerning any other person, firm or entity (including, but not limited to, any such person, firm or entity which may be a competitor or potential competitor of) which UTK may have or be able to obtain other than as a result of the relationship established by this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'trade secret' from sections A, the obligation to not divulge trade secrets is removed. However, in section C, the text still makes reference to 'secret or confidential information', this creates an inconsistency as to whether or not UTK is still required to protect trade secrets.",

                "explanation": "The non-solicitation agreement is removed for UTEK, but not AVDU. The phrase 'In turn, UTEK agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit any present employee of AVDU' has been removed. This creates a contradiction in the implicit understanding of mutual restriction. Section IX (E) then refers to the entire agreement embodying all understandings, leading to a conflict.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'While conducting our search we will maintain the confidentiality of AVDU', an obligation has been removed. In Section VIII (A), UTK is still obligated to protect the confidential information of AVDU. This introduces an internal contradiction because the explicit promise of confidentiality during the search (as defined in the Term Sheet) is removed, which weakens or contradicts the broader confidentiality obligations outlined in the main agreement.",

                "original_text": "As a sponsor of the Event, the Sponsor is entitled to the following sponsorship components:\n\n*  Two Floor Cards (12in x 66in) in prominent position for TV camera *  Two Drapes over ropes (5in x 60in, with lettering within the middle 36\") *  Two Ring Side banners (200cm x 15cm) *  One overhead banner (5ft x 8 ft) to be hung over boxing ring *  Other handout materials for audience",
                "changed_text": "As a sponsor of the Event, the Sponsor is entitled to sponsorship components as determined by ACM, including potential floor cards, drapes, banners, and handout materials.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific details and dimensions of the sponsorship components, and replacing them with a vague reference controlled by ACM, this creates uncertainty. Section 3 states the Sponsor pays a specific amount for the above sponsorship components. Now, with the changed text, it's unclear what the Sponsor is actually paying for, potentially leading to disputes regarding fulfillment and value of the sponsorship.",

                "changed_text": "For sponsorship, the Sponsor agrees to pay ACM an amount as detailed in Appendix A. The amount is payable as per the schedule in Appendix A.",
                "explanation": "By changing the payment clause to reference 'Appendix A' that doesn't exist, this creates an in-text contradiction. The contract states that payment is required, but removes any specifics regarding amount or schedule, making the contract unenforceable. The agreement states payment for the 'above sponsorship components' - However, if those are now subject to ACM's control, the original agreed dollar amount is meaningless.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of a dispute, the parties may consider dispute resolution.",
                "explanation": "By changing the dispute resolution clause from mandatory mediation in a third country to a discretionary consideration of dispute resolution, the modified text makes the enforcement process significantly more ambiguous. The original text provided a clear, albeit vague, framework. The changed text allows either party to avoid any formal dispute resolution, making it difficult to enforce any part of the agreement.",

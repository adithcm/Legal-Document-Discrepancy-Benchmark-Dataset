                "explanation": "By removing 'in connection with the ERB', the clause becomes overly broad. It now applies to HERC's use of HERC trademarks *generally*, not specifically in connection with the Equipment Rental Business. Since ERB's definition was removed, this creates an inconsistency because it's unclear if HERC's actions outside the undefined 'Equipment Rental Business' are governed by this clause and the Coexistence Agreement. It is unknown if HERC is subject to the Coexistence Agreement, if the ERB definition is not present.",

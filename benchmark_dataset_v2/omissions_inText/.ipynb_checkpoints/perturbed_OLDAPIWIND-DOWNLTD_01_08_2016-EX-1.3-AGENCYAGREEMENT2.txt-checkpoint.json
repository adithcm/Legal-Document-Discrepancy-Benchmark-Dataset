                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the Agency Agreement and Schedule A for defining terms, the modified text creates uncertainty. Other sections of the certificate rely on definitions within the Agency Agreement (e.g., 'Accredited Investor' is tied to compliance with US Securities Laws as detailed in Schedule A). Now, the definitions are ambiguous, potentially contradicting the specific requirements outlined in Schedule A, and rendering the compliance claims questionable.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit requirement to adhere to the Agency Agreement and its Schedule A. Other clauses within the certificate claim compliance with US Securities laws and the need to identify Accredited Investors, which are typically detailed within the Agency Agreement and Schedule A. Replacing this with 'standard industry practices' creates a contradiction, as these practices may not fully align with the specific requirements of the Agency Agreement, leading to uncertain enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause provides a detailed representation and warranty regarding Disqualification Events, with specific exceptions. The modified clause replaces the strict representation with a 'best efforts' obligation, removing the guarantee that no relevant individual is subject to a disqualification event. However, other clauses may still imply a higher standard of compliance with Regulation D, leading to a contradiction regarding the level of assurance provided against Disqualification Events.",

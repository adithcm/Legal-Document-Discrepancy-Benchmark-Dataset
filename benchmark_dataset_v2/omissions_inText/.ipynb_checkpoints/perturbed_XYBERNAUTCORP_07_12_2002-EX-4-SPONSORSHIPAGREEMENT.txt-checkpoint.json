                "original_text": "AJR shall provide a link from its website to XC's website, such linking to be accomplished as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement. AJR shall not          &bbsp;              make any  reference  to XC on its website (or modify any                         approved reference) without XC's prior written approval.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may,' the contract introduces ambiguity as to whether AJR is obligated to provide a link, even though other sections imply that promotional activities, including website links, are part of the sponsorship benefits. This creates uncertainty about AJR's responsibilities.",

The Warrants shall have an exercise price of $1.18 per share being the closing market price for the Common Stock on April 30, 2002 and shall be exercisable for a period of three (3) years from their date of issue.",

                "explanation": "By removing critical specifics of the common stock like par value and the quantity offered, and the Warrants such as the exact number of shares, exercise price, and term, there is a contradiction. This omission directly contradicts other clauses that are related and enforcing the warrants will now be uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not take any action' to 'shall endeavor to avoid any action' weakens AJR's obligation to protect XC's reputation. This omission creates a contradiction because the original text promises a strong commitment to protecting XC's reputation; the new term implies that AJR is not fully responsible and might not be fully liable for their actions and reputation.",

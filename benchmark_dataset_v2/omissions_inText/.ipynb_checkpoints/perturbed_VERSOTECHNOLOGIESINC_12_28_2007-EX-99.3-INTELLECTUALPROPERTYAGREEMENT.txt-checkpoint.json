                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, Seller and Verso Technologies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (\"Buyer\"), have entered into an agreement (the \"Agreement\"); and\n\nWHEREAS, Buyer has designated Backhaul as a recipient of assets pursuant to an assignment agreement between Buyer and Backhaul dated as of the date hereof.",
                "explanation": "Removing specific references to the 'Asset Purchase Agreement' and its detailed description, while retaining the general concept of an 'Agreement,' creates ambiguity. Later clauses referring to the 'Asset Purchase Agreement' now lack a clear definition, leading to uncertainty about which agreement's terms govern the Intellectual Property Agreement. The changed text contradicts the rest of the contract that keeps referring to the 'Asset Purchase Agreement'.",

Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time forthwith upon the reasonable written request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",

Seller hereby covenants and agrees to execute further documents reasonably requested by Backhaul or Buyer to transfer title to such intellectual property.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Assigned Intellectual Property,' 'Trademarks and Patents set forth on Schedules A and B,' the contract becomes vague about what specific intellectual property is being transferred. Later references to Schedules A and B are now meaningless since the contract doesn't explicitly tie the transfer to these schedules. This omission contradicts any other sections that refer to specific items within those schedules. The meaning of 'certain intellectual property' becomes open to interpretation, and it contradicts the sections referring to schedules A and B.",

Nothing contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement shall be deemed to supersede any of the obligations, agreements, representations, covenants or warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.",

Nothing in this Intellectual Property Agreement supersedes the obligations of Seller and Buyer in their existing agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific reference to the 'Asset Purchase Agreement' here further exacerbates the initial omission. The document now states it's subject to a vague 'agreement' without clear definition, and that its intention is only to document the assignment of general intellectual property, where there had initially been definition by 'Assigned Intellectual Property.' The initial omission created an internal contradiction, and this subsequent change enhances the issue of ambiguity. Other parts of the contract still refer to definitions and items in the schedules that should have been referenced at this point in the text to maintain consistency.",

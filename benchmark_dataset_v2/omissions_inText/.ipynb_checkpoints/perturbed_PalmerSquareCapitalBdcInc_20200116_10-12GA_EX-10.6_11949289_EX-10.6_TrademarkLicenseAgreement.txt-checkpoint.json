                "original_text": "ARTICLE 2. COMPLIANCE 2.1. Quality Control. In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to ensure that it maintains the quality of the Licensee's business and the operation thereof equal to the standards prevailing in the operation of Licensee's business as of the Effective Date. The Licensee further agrees to use the Licensed Mark in accordance with such quality standards as may be reasonably established by Licensor and communicated to the Licensee from time to time in writing, or as may be agreed to by Licensor and the Licensee from time to time in writing.",
                "changed_text": "ARTICLE 2. COMPLIANCE 2.1. Quality Control. In order to preserve the inherent value of the Licensed Mark, Licensee agrees to use reasonable efforts to maintain the quality of the Licensee's business.",
                "explanation": "By removing the second sentence, the requirement to adhere to quality standards communicated in writing by the Licensor is eliminated. However, Article 1.1 still references 'Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement', implying the existence of quality standards detailed elsewhere. This creates a contradiction, because there is no explicit mechanism anymore for Licensor to enforce specific quality standards beyond the general 'reasonable efforts' clause.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and Licensee shall immediately delete the term \"Palmer Square\" from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark. For twenty-four (24) months following termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall specify on all public-facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Mark shall cease, and Licensee shall immediately delete the term \"Palmer Square\" from its corporate name and shall discontinue all other use of the Licensed Mark.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the requirement for the Licensee to specify its disassociation from the Licensor on public-facing materials for 24 months post-termination, a contradiction arises. While the Licensee must cease using the mark, the removal of the disclaimer obligation potentially weakens the Licensor's ability to defend against future Third Party Claims (mentioned in Article 2.3 and 4.1). Article 4.1 anticipates that the licensor may have to defend itself, which becomes complicated without a disassociation disclaimer on public materials.",

The parties agree that Investment Advisor shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and shall have the rights and protections provided to Licensee under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, either express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any third party other than Investment Advisor any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'shall have the rights and protections provided to Licensee under this Agreement', the extent of the Investment Advisor's rights as a third-party beneficiary becomes ambiguous. While the Investment Advisor remains a beneficiary, the omission creates uncertainty about whether they have the same rights as the Licensee, potentially contradicting the initial intention expressed in the recitals, specifically 'WHEREAS, it is intended that Investment Advisor be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement'.",

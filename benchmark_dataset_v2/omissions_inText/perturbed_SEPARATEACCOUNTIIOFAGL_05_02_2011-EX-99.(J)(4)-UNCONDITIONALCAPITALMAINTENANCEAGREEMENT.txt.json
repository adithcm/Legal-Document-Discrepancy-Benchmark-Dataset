                "original_text": "In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital for each of the        Company's first and third fiscal quarters (as determined based on the        Company's first and third fiscal quarterly filed statutory financial        statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments or modifications        thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance department or the        Company's independent auditors) falls below the Specified Minimum        Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action Level RBC (in each        case as estimated by the Company as of the end of each such first and        third fiscal quarters, as the case may be), AIG shall, within the        respective time periods set forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with        paragraph 5 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the        Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other instruments that        qualify (as admitted assets) for purposes of calculating the Company's        Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, in an        amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of        each of the\n\n       Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter, as the case may be, will be        projected to be at least equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of        the Company's Company Action Level RBC. Notwithstanding the foregoing,        AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in        compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in        such amount as is required for the Company's Total Adjusted Capital to        equal a percentage of its Company Action Level RBC determined to be        appropriate by the Company and AIG.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in such amount as is required for the Company's Total Adjusted Capital to equal a percentage of its Company Action Level RBC determined to be appropriate by the Company and AIG.",
                "explanation": "Removing the precise definitions and requirements for maintaining Total Adjusted Capital and the obligation for AIG to contribute introduces ambiguity. The original text mandates AIG's contribution if specific conditions are met, whereas the modified text makes it discretionary ('may provide'). This creates a contradiction, as other sections might still assume AIG has an obligation when the 'Total Adjusted Capital' falls below the 'Specified Minimum Percentage'.",

The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the        percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be        agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon        the date of the filing of the Company's 2010 Annual Statement with the        Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against        the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each        of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service        (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the        obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum        Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and        revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the        parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material        changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of        S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the        Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand,        which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that        under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or        instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is        treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand,        and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any        other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which        AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum        Percentage then in effect.",

AIG and the Company may review relevant industry standards and practices periodically. AIG and the Company may agree to review and revise any percentage if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account any developments affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation.",
                "explanation": "This revision removes the specific definitions tied to regulatory bodies and replaces them with vague industry standards. Furthermore, Schedule 1, which defines the “Specified Minimum Percentage,” is no longer referenced. This creates a contradiction because, while the contract still references 'Total Adjusted Capital', 'Company Action Level RBC', and a percentage to be maintained, their precise calculations and the benchmark percentage are undefined. Later sections relying on these terms become unenforceable due to the lack of concrete standards.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific references to paragraphs 1, 4, and 5 throughout Paragraph 9, the policyholder's right to demand enforcement becomes vague. While the paragraph still grants policyholders the right to enforce the 'Company's rights under this Agreement', the absence of clear specification as to which rights are enforceable introduces ambiguity. Given the changes made to paragraphs 1 and 3, and the deletion of 4 and 5, the policyholder's recourse against AIG is now unclear and potentially unenforceable.",

In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital for each of the Company's first and third fiscal quarters (as determined based on the Company's first and third fiscal quarterly filed statutory financial statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance department or the Company's independent auditors) falls below the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action Level RBC (in each case as estimated by the Company as of the end of each such first and third fiscal quarters, as the case may be), AIG shall, within the respective time periods set forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with paragraph 5 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other instruments that qualify (as admitted assets) for purposes of calculating the Company's Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, in an amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of each of the Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter, as the case may be, will be projected to be at least equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action Level RBC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in such amount as is required for the Company's Total Adjusted Capital to equal a percentage of its Company Action Level RBC determined to be appropriate by the Company and AIG.",

In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital for each of the Company's first and third fiscal quarters falls below a certain percentage of the Company's projected capital requirements, AIG shall, within the respective time periods set forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with paragraph 5 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the Company financial assistance as a contribution and not as a loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in such amount as is required for the Company's financial stability.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific definitions of 'Total Adjusted Capital', 'Specified Minimum Percentage', and 'Company Action Level RBC', and replacing them with vague terms, the enforcement of this section becomes uncertain. Later sections still reference these defined terms, creating a contradiction and ambiguity.",

For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\", \"Company Action Level RBC\", and \"Surplus to Policyholders\" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of the Domiciliary State, or, with respect to \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC\", if not defined therein, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\").",

                "explanation": "Removing the definitions for 'Total Adjusted Capital' and 'Company Action Level RBC' creates a contradiction because paragraph 1 still references these terms. Without a clear definition, the obligation of AIG to provide capital is unclear and unenforceable, especially as the rest of the document is referring these terms.",

                "explanation": "Removing Schedule 1, which defines the 'Specified Minimum Percentage' creates a significant contradiction. Paragraphs 1 and 2 rely on this percentage to determine when AIG's capital maintenance obligations are triggered and when the Company can pay dividends. Without this schedule, those sections become meaningless and unenforceable, as the primary trigger for action is undefined. This renders the agreement internally inconsistent and of questionable value.",

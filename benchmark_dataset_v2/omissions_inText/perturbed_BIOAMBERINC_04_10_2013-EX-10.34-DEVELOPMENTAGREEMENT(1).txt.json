Any invention or discovery relating to the Work Plan, in whole or in part, that is conceived during the term of this Development Agreement shall be an \"Improvement\". The scope for Improvements will be limited to the CB1 strain itself and the [***] (the  \"Field\"), but shall exclude [***]. Bioamber will own any Improvement in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof and such Improvement  shall be designated \"Bioamber Improvements\". Cargill will own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts  thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, and such Improvement shall be designated \"Cargill Improvements\". In the  event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an  invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement  shall be designated \"Joint Improvements\". For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to  fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such  Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Bioamber Improvement and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a  Cargill Improvement.",

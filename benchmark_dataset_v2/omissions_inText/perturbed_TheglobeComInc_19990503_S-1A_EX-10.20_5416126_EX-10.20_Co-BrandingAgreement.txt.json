                "original_text": "The Mark owner may terminate the foregoing trademark license if, in its reasonable discretion, the licensee's use of the Marks tarnishes, blurs or dilutes the quality associated with the Marks or the associated goodwill and such problem is not cured within 10 days of notice of breach; alternatively, instead of terminating the license in total, the owner may specify that certain licensee uses may not contain the Marks.  Title to and ownership of the owner's Marks shall remain with the owner.  The licensee shall use the Marks exactly in the form provided and in conformance with any trademark usage policies.  The licensee shall not take any action inconsistent with the owner's ownership of the Marks, and any benefits accruing from use of such Marks shall automatically vest in the owner.  The licensee shall not form any combination marks with the other party's Marks other than the Domain Name (if applicable).  If the Domain Name is deemed a combination mark, neither party shall use the Domain Name for any purpose except as expressly provided herein or attempt to register the Domain Name, and the parties will jointly cooperate on any enforcement action of infringement of the Domain Name.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause that states '...and such problem is not cured within 10 days of notice of breach; alternatively, instead of terminating the license in total, the owner may specify that certain licensee uses may not contain the Marks. The licensee shall use the Marks exactly in the form provided and in conformance with any trademark usage policies' it introduces an internal contradiction. The mark owner can now terminate the agreement without giving an opportunity to fix the problem or giving notice of the problem. Furthermore, if the licensee does not conform with trademark usage policies, there is no mention of repercussions. Finally, the parties are not obligated to cooperate on enforcement of infringement of the domain name.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specificity of 'CPM- or CPC-based advertisements and promotions (other than those for its commerce partners) delivered in connection with the Co-Branded Pages, less a sales and administration fee of 15%' creates an ambiguity in the revenue sharing calculation. It's no longer explicit how 'Net Revenues' are calculated, especially concerning commerce partners or fees. This creates enforcement uncertainty and could lead to disputes.",

Due to lack of proper guidelines, there may be issues for theglobe's team when gathering user data from Boxlot, which will lead to conflicts with Boxlot.",

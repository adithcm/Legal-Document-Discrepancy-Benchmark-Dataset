                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Revenues' specifies a fixed 15% deduction for sales and administration fees. The modified text removes this fixed percentage and states that deductions will be handled on a 'case-by-case basis'. This introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes, as the method and amount of deductions are no longer clearly defined. Later sections that reference Net Revenues will now be subject to interpretation, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the payment milestones for the 1st through 11th monthly anniversaries from Launch Date, while still referencing payments at execution, launch and then 'Each monthly anniversary thereafter' makes it unclear which monthly payments are due.

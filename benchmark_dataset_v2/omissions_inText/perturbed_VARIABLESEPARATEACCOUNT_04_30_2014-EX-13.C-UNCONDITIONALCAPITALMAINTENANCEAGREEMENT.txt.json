                "original_text": "2. Defined Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC\" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of the Domiciliary State, or, if not defined therein, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon the date of the filing of the Company's 2014 Annual Statement with the Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",
                "changed_text": "2. Defined Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC\" shall have the meanings as determined solely by AIG. The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" will be decided at AIG's discretion, to align with AIG's internal financial goals.",
                "explanation": "By removing the references to the Domiciliary State's insurance laws, NAIC RBC instructions, and external rating agencies (S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best), the definition of key financial terms becomes entirely subjective and controlled by AIG. This contradicts the original intent of relying on objective, external standards for calculating capital adequacy. This could create uncertainty in enforcement as the 'Specified Minimum Percentage' referenced later may be drastically different than what the Company would expect.",

Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that no policyholder of the Company may take any action authorized under this paragraph 8 unless and until (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 8, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and, provided, further, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 8 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to, and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 8).",
                "changed_text": "8. Policyholder Rights. Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to suggest that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement. Policyholder rights are subject to AIG's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'demand' to 'suggest' and adding the phrase 'Policyholder rights are subject to AIG's sole discretion,' this modification severely weakens the policyholder's ability to enforce the capital maintenance agreement. While the original text grants policyholders the right to directly enforce the agreement under certain conditions, the altered text makes their rights discretionary and dependent on AIG's approval. This omission introduces an internal contradiction, because paragraphs 1, 3, and 4 remain, suggesting obligations on AIG, but those obligations are now unenforceable at the policyholder's initiative, creating uncertainty about whether they mean anything.",

                "changed_text": "SCHEDULE 1 The Specified Minimum Percentage will be determined at the sole discretion of AIG.",
                "explanation": "Removing the concrete value creates ambiguity. By omitting the 385% benchmark, the contract refers to a minimum percentage, yet provides no fixed value. This creates uncertainty. It conflicts with other clauses in the contract that rely on the concept of a 'Specified Minimum Percentage' for triggering capital contributions, but its actual value is unspecified. This renders the enforcement of those clauses problematic, because AIG can decide that the percentage is effectively zero.",

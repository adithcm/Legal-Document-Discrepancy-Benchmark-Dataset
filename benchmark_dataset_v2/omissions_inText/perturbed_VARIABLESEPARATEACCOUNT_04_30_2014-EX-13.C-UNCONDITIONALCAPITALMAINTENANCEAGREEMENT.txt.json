For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and \"Company Action Level RBC\" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of the Domiciliary State, or, if not defined therein, shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon the date of the filing of the Company's 2014 Annual Statement with the Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.",

AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); provided, however, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer, in each case, (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale. To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains outstanding as of, the Termination Date.",

Paragraph 8 gives policyholders rights to enforce the agreement. With the modified termination clause, AIG's 'absolute right' now conflicts with the policyholder's enforcement rights under paragraph 8, creating uncertainty about the enforceability of the agreement and those policyholder rights.",

This makes Section 1, which relies on the 'Specified Minimum Percentage', unenforceable. Furthermore, section 2 makes explicit reference to schedule 1.

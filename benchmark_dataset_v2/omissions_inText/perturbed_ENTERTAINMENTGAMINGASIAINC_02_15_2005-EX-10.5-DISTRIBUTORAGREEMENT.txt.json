In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either Section 1.1.4 or 1.1.5 of this Agreement, this shall not of itself be deemed a breach hereof but Distributor shall have the right to receive monthly compensation from Vendor, or successor to the Vendor, representing the amount of profit to Distributor lost as a result of the termination (the \"Monthly Compensation\").\n\n  1.6.1. Calculation. The amount of the Monthly Compensation shall be determined by taking average gross profit related to the relevant Products for each of the monthly periods completed since the beginning of this Agreement, where \"gross profit\" shall mean the difference between the revenue generated by Distributor during the relevant period less any commissions paid by Distributor to third parties and less the Price paid by Distributor to Vendor for the relevant Products (exclusive of any taxes, charges, fees or impositions related to sales or delivery).\n\n  1.6.2. Payment. The Monthly Compensation shall be paid for the remaining monthly periods remaining in the Term, as if the termination of this Agreement had not occurred, or twenty four (24) calendar months, which ever period is less, where payment shall be made no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the end of the relevant monthly period.\n\n-2-\n\n\n\n  1.6.3. Reservation of Rights. For the avoidance of doubt, Distributor's right to compensation shall be without prejudice to its rights in respect of any breach by Vendor of this Agreement.",

In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either Section 1.1.4 or 1.1.5 of this Agreement, this shall not of itself be deemed a breach hereof but Distributor *may* have the right to receive compensation from Vendor, or successor to the Vendor (the \"Compensation\").\n\n-2-\n\n\n\n  1.6.3. Reservation of Rights. For the avoidance of doubt, Distributor's right to compensation shall be without prejudice to its rights in respect of any breach by Vendor of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'Calculation' and 'Payment' clauses from Section 1.6, the contract still mentions 'Compensation' but provides no method to calculate it or timeline for payment. The term 'may' introduces uncertainty about the distributor's compensation rights. This creates an internal contradiction because the reservation of rights clause still alludes to a right that is not clearly defined or enforceable.",

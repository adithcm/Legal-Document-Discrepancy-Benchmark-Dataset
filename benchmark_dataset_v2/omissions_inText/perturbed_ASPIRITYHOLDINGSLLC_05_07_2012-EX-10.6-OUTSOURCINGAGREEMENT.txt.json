In consideration of the agreement of the Contractor to provide its services as set forth in this Agreement, the Company will pay the Contractor the following amounts: (i) a monthly service fee of $7.50 per note based on the maximum number of notes outstanding during the month, subject to a monthly minimum of $2,500; (ii) a fee for media services further described in Exhibit A equal to the 15% gross/net differential or the fee equivalent thereof; (iii) a fulfillment fee of $2.00 per investment kit mailed; (iv) a fulfillment fee of $1.00 per address for each bonus offer or marketing postcard mailed, subject to a $10,000 maximum per project.",

In consideration of the agreement of the Contractor to provide its services as set forth in this Agreement, the Company will pay the Contractor based on a mutually agreed upon schedule to be determined at a later date. Details of the fee structure will be outlined in a separate addendum.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a detailed fee structure. The modified text replaces this with a vague reference to a 'mutually agreed upon schedule' and a 'separate addendum'. This omission creates uncertainty because the payment terms are not defined in the main agreement, making enforcement difficult and contradicting the initial detailed arrangement.",

The Contractor shall to the best of its knowledge ensure that each person submitting a Subscription Agreement shall have received the Prospectus. An Investor who visits the offering web site shall be deemed to have received the Prospectus, provided such person either delivers an Electronic Delivery Consent Form with such Investors Subscription Agreement or certifies under penalties of perjury that he, she or it has received the Prospectus.",

The specifics of these services will be detailed in supplemental guidelines issued by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text lists specific tasks related to investor relations and Prospectus delivery. The modified text removes these specifics and replaces them with a vague reference to 'supplemental guidelines'. This creates an omission that introduces an in-text contradiction because the contract mentions providing services but does not specify what those services are, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over fulfillment of obligations.",

The modified text replaces this with a vague statement about eligibility based on 'internal policies,' which are not defined or accessible within the contract. This omission creates a contradiction because the contract references indemnification but provides no specific details or guarantees, making it unclear under what circumstances the Contractor is actually protected.",

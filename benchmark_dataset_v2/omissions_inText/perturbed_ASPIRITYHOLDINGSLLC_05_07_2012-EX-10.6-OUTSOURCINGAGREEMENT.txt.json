In consideration of the agreement of the Contractor to provide its services as set forth in this\nAgreement, the Company will pay the Contractor the following amounts:\n\n(i) a monthly service fee of $7.50 per note based on the maximum number of notes outstanding during the\nmonth, subject to a monthly minimum of $2,500;\n\n(ii) a fee for media services further described in Exhibit A equal to the 15% gross/net differential or the fee\nequivalent thereof;\n\n(iii) a fulfillment fee of $2.00 per investment kit mailed;\n\n(iv) a fulfillment fee of $1.00 per address for each bonus offer or marketing postcard mailed, subject to a $10,000\nmaximum per project.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific fee schedule but retaining the concept of 'The Contractor's Fees', the contract creates ambiguity. Subsequent sections might reference 'fees' without a clear definition, making enforcement difficult. This also introduces uncertainty about how the contractor will be compensated, potentially contradicting other statements about fair compensation. This leads to uncertainty and contradiction.",

The Contractor shall establish and maintain at all times during the term of this\nAgreement files and records (including, without limitation, computerized records) regarding the Notes and the Note Portfolio, with full and correct\nentries of all transactions or modifications in a reasonably secure, up-to-date manner and in accordance with the following:\n\n(a) Location. All Note and Note Portfolio files and records shall be stored and maintained at the Contractor's principal place of\nbusiness, or other location as designated by the Company. The Contractor shall keep in such files all correspondence received or sent\nregarding each Note, each Investor, and each Holder, whether upon any purchase or transfer of a Note.\n\n(b) Original Documents. The Contractor will store all original Subscription Agreements, Note Confirmations, correspondence\nfrom Investors and Holders and other materials relating to the Renewable Note Program in a reasonably secure manner at the\nContractor's principal offices or such other location as may be designated by the Company. The Contractor shall exercise due care in\nhandling and delivering the original documents and the other documents in the Note files and records. The Contractor shall not grant\nor allow any person an interest in original documents or rights thereunder, and all original documents in the possession of the\nContractor shall be deemed to be in the possession of the Company.\n\n(c) Examination. At any time the Company and its agents and representatives may physically inspect any documents, files or\nother records relating to the Renewable Note Program and discuss the same with the Contractor's officers and employees. The\nContractor shall supply copies of any such documents, files, or other records upon the request of the Company, as soon as is\nreasonably and commercially practicable at the Company's cost and expense.\n\n(d) Retention. Unless otherwise requested by the Company, or unless otherwise required by Governmental Rules, the\nContractor shall retain, with respect to\n\neach Note, for a period of 24 months from the date the Note is fully paid, all records, files and documents related to each such Note. At\nthe end of such 24-month period, unless otherwise directed by the Company, all such items shall be transferred to the Company, or to a\nthird party as designated by the Company, at the Company's sole cost and expense. The Contractor shall be permitted to retain copies\nof any such documents for its own files for its own account and at its own expense.

The Contractor shall be entitled to make and keep copies of such records, at its cost and expense. In addition to\ndelivering such data and monies, the Contractor shall use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the administration\nof the Notes to the Company or other party designated by the Company to assume responsibility for such administration, including,\nwithout limitation, directing Holders to remit all repurchase or other notices to the address designated by the Company. All costs of\nconversion and transfer of such records to the Company or another agent shall be paid by the Company.",

Upon termination, the Contractor will deliver records to the Company, subject to applicable laws and contractual obligations.",
                "explanation": "Removing the detailed specifications for record maintenance and replacing them with vague references to the Contractor's internal policies and standard practices creates several contradictions. The amended text grants the Contractor significant discretion, potentially conflicting with other clauses emphasizing the Company's control over the Renewable Note Program. For example, Section 3.01(b) requires remitting copies of Subscription Agreements to the Trustee as requested, but here the obligation is diminished. Also, the original text specifies a 24-month retention period, while the modified version allows for variable retention periods, which introduces ambiguity and potential inconsistency with regulatory requirements or industry best practices.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Indemnification clauses, the contract lacks critical protection for both parties. The absence of these clauses conflicts with the general expectation that parties to a significant business agreement would have mutual indemnification. The entire contract implies a certain level of responsibility and liability, which is unsupported by the explicit terms. Also, Section 9.01 (Survival) refers to the 'respective indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Contractor', which are now missing.",

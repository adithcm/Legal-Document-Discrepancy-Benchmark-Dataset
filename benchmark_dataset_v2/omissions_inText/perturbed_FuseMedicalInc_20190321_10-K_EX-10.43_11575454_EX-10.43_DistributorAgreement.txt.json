Definitions and interpretation\n\n1.1 The definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in this agreement.\n\nBusiness Day: a day (other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in Australia) when banks in Sydney are open for business.\n\nCommencement Date: means the date of this agreement.\n\nControl: the ability to direct the affairs of another person, whether by virtue of the ownership of shares, contract or otherwise.\n\nInactive Territories means a country in which the Distributor has not sold or supplied the Product during the Initial Term.\n\nInitial Term has the meaning given to it in clause 12.1.\n\nProducts: As defined in Schedule 1 and includes any other products developed by the Supplier and which the Supplier may permit the Distributor, by express notice in writing, to distribute in the Territory.\n\nTerm: the term of this agreement, as determined in accordance with clause 11.

Definitions and interpretation\n\n1.1 The definitions and rules of interpretation in this clause apply in this agreement.\n\nBusiness Day: a standard business day.\n\nCommencement Date: means the start date of the agreement.\n\nControl: influence over another person.\n\nInactive Territories means a country.\n\nInitial Term has the meaning given to it in clause 12.1.\n\nProducts: Any product sold by the supplier.\n\nTerm: the length of this agreement, as determined in accordance with clause 11. Territory: Anywhere the distributor wishes to sell.\n\nTrade Marks: Any trademarks that the supplier owns or creates.\n\nGST: goods and services tax.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definitions of several key terms, uncertainty is introduced as the interpretation of these terms is now subjective. For example, defining 'Business Day' as 'a standard business day' is ambiguous as it lacks the specific geographical and holiday-related details of the original definition. Similarly, changing 'Territory' to 'Anywhere the distributor wishes to sell' contradicts the specified territory of 'USA' defined in Schedule 2, which is referenced in the original definition.",

                "changed_text": "5. Prices and payment\n\n5.1 The prices to be paid by the Distributor to the Supplier for the Products are to be a fair market price.\n\n5.2 Any and all expenses, costs and charges incurred by the Distributor in the performance of its obligations under this agreement will be paid by the Distributor, unless otherwise negotiated.\n\n5.3 The Distributor must pay the amount invoiced to it by the Supplier within a reasonable time of the date of invoice.\n\n5.4 Neither party may withhold payment of any amount due to the other.",
                "explanation": "Removing the Schedule 4 reference and stating 'fair market price' creates ambiguity, especially when read in conjunction with Schedule 4 listing prices. Defining payment as 'reasonable time' creates uncertainty about the acceptable payment timeframe. By removing USD reference, this will create confusion when sending payments between companies. All changes create a contradiction on how the contract is enforced.",

                "original_text": "10. Product liability and insurance\n\n10.1 Subject to the Distributor fulfilling all the conditions in this clause 10, the Supplier shall indemnify the Distributor, defend and hold harmless against any liability incurred by the Distributor in respect of damage to property, death or personal injury arising from any fault or defect in the design of the Products and any reasonable costs, claims, demands and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with that liability (Relevant Claim), except to the extent the liability arises as a result of the wilful misconduct of the Distributor. The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate.\n\n10.2 The Distributor shall, within five days of a matter which may result in a Relevant Claim:\n\n(a) give the Supplier written notice of the details of the matter;\n\n(b) give the Supplier access to and allow copies to be taken of any materials, records or documents as the Supplier may require to take action under clause 10.2(c);\n\n(c) allow the Supplier the exclusive conduct of any proceedings and take any action that the Supplier requires to defend or resist the matter, including using professional advisers nominated by the Supplier; and\n\n(d) not admit liability or settle the matter without the Supplier's written consent.\n\n10.3 During the Term, the Supplier shall maintain product liability insurance with a reputable insurer of no less than AU$10 million for any one occurrence for any and all liability (however arising) for a claim that the Products are faulty or defective. The Supplier shall provide a copy of the insurance policy to the Distributor on request.\n\n10.4 The Distributor undertakes to maintain appropriate, up-to-date and accurate records to enable the immediate recall of any Products or batches of Products from the retail or wholesale markets. These records shall include records of deliveries to customers (including batch numbers, delivery date, name and address of customer, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address).\n\n10.5 The Distributor shall, at the Supplier's cost, give any assistance that the Supplier shall reasonably require to recall, as a matter of urgency, Products from the retail or wholesale market.",

                "explanation": "By removing key details about the conditions for indemnification, the definition of a 'Relevant Claim', specific timeframes for notification, and the minimum insurance coverage amount, the section becomes significantly weaker and more ambiguous. The original clause provided a structured framework for managing product liability, while the modified clause is vague and open to interpretation, increasing the potential for disputes.",

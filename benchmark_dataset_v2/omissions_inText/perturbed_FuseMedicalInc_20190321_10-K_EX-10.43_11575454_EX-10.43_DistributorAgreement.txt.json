                "explanation": "By removing the definitions of 'Business Day', 'Inactive Territories', 'Initial Term' and 'Year', while clauses 2.2 and 11.1 still reference 'Initial Term' and 'Inactive Territories', there's an internal contradiction, creating uncertainty in enforcement as these terms are no longer formally defined.",

Product liability and insurance 10.1 Subject to the Distributor fulfilling all the conditions in this clause 10, the Supplier shall indemnify the Distributor, defend and hold harmless against any liability incurred by the Distributor in respect of damage to property, death or personal injury arising from any fault or defect in the design of the Products and any reasonable costs, claims, demands and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with that liability (Relevant Claim), except to the extent the liability arises as a result of the wilful misconduct of the Distributor. The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate. 10.2 The Distributor shall, within five days of a matter which may result in a Relevant Claim: (a) give the Supplier written notice of the details of the matter; (b) give the Supplier access to and allow copies to be taken of any materials, records or documents as the Supplier may require to take action under clause 10.2(c); (c) allow the Supplier the exclusive conduct of any proceedings and take any action that the Supplier requires to defend or resist the matter, including using professional advisers nominated by the Supplier; and (d) not admit liability or settle the matter without the Supplier's written consent. 10.3 During the Term, the Supplier shall maintain product liability insurance with a reputable insurer of no less than AU$10 million for any one occurrence for any and all liability (however arising) for a claim that the Products are faulty or defective. The Supplier shall provide a copy of the insurance policy to the Distributor on request.",

                "explanation": "By removing some of the Distributor's requirements in order to fulfill conditions from product liability and insurance, it weakens the supplier's responsibility in Section 10.1. Then, by not specifying a limit for a reputable insurance insurer, it makes it up to the supplier. This is an in-text contradiction because the supplier can determine what their insurance will be, and this introduces an unbalance to the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific amount for the Sponsorship Fee, the contract lacks a crucial financial term. This creates a contradiction because the contract still refers to the 'Sponsorship Fee' in later sections, yet the agreed-upon amount is missing, leading to uncertainty and unenforceability.",

The arbitrator for any dispute shall be selected according to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n\n(c) Arbitration Award. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, shall identify a winning Party, and judgment may be entered upon the award in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof",

                "explanation": "By omitting, the full arbitration, details, the venue, the arbitrator selection process, and the finality of the award, the mechanism for dispute resolution becomes unclear. This creates a contradiction because the contract states that all disputes are resolved by arbitration without providing the details on how that process would work, leading to potential legal challenges and difficulties in enforcing the arbitration clause.",

                "original_text": "A. \"Celebrity Endorsement\" shall mean the right to use, subject to the provisions hereof, CELEBRITY's name (including variations and derivations of the same), nickname, initials, autograph, voice, video or film portrayals, facsimile signature, photograph, trade name, likeness and image or facsimile image, or means of endorsement (not including video) (individually and collectively, the \"Personality Rights\"), in each case, solely as Approved (as hereinafter defined) by ABG, in connection with the advertising, promotion and sale of Products.",

                "explanation": "By removing specifics like 'nickname, initials, autograph, voice, video or film portrayals' and the critical clause 'solely as Approved (as hereinafter defined) by ABG', we create uncertainty. Later sections reference the 'Approval' process and Personality Rights, making those sections ambiguous as the original definition is significantly altered.",

In consideration of the rights granted herein and the Services to be provided hereunder, PAPA JOHN'S will pay to ABG in each Contract Year of the Term, the following:\n\nA. Cash Payment.\n\n1. PAPA JOHN'S shall pay ABG a cash payment of: One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,250,000) for Contract Year 1, One Million Three Hundred Seventy Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,375,000) for Contract Year 2, and One Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,500,000) for Contract Year 3 (such cash payments for Contract Years 1-3 referred to herein as the \"Cash Payment\") for the services and rights provided hereunder. In addition to the Cash Payment and any other compensation payable to ABG (and, as applicable, CELEBRITY) hereunder, PAPA JOHN'S shall pay without limitation, usage of the union-covered materials produced hereunder, with usage applied against the Cash Payment at double scale (or such other applicable rate). Each of such Cash Payments shall be paid in four equal installments, as set forth in Section 5.A.3 below, as follows:\n\n(A) The first payment is due on the Effective Date for the First Contract Year, and March 1 for subsequent Contract Years;\n\n(B) The second payment is due June 1 for each Contract Year;\n\n(C) The third payment is due September 1 for each Contract Year; and\n\n(D) The fourth payment is due December 1 for each Contract Year.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific amounts and installment dates related to the Cash Payment, we create a contradiction. Other sections, specifically 7.D.a. and 7.D.b., rely on the cash payment amounts and payment schedule for termination clauses. With those specifics gone, it's unclear how payments are determined if the agreement is terminated early, and Section 5.A.3 is now being referenced, but is not available.",

ABG shall respond to each initial request for Approval from PAPA JOHN'S (\"First Request\") within three (3) days of ABG's receipt of such request (\"Approval Window\"); provided, however that ABG's silence or failure to respond to the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window shall be deemed ABG's disapproval of the Materials contained in the First Request for Approval. In the event that ABG is silent with respect to, or fails to reply to, the First Request prior to the expiration of the Approval Window, then PAPA JOHN'S shall be entitled to submit a second (2nd) request for Approval of the same Materials included in the First Request (\"Second Request\"), with a copy of the Materials and the request to ABG's Legal Department (using the contact information set forth in Section 12.F. of this Agreement). In the event that ABG is silent with respect to, or fails to reply to, the Second Request within three (3) days of ABG's receipt thereof, then ABG's silence with respect to, or failure to respond to, the Second Request shall be deemed ABG's Approval of the Materials included in the Second Request. PAPA JOHN'S hereby acknowledges that ABG's Approval of any particular Materials for a specific purpose shall only be deemed an Approval for said purpose. PAPA JOHN'S shall be required to re-submit any previously Approved Materials to the extent PAPA JOHN'S wishes to use the same for other purposes. PAPA JOHN'S hereby acknowledges that, in the event PAPA JOHN'S fails to obtain ABG's consent or approval for any act or omission requiring such consent or approval (e.g., use of Celebrity Endorsement or Personality Rights, etc.), the same shall be deemed a non-curable breach of this Agreement entitling, but not requiring, ABG to immediately terminate this Agreement. In the event that ABG expressly disapproves any Materials that are submitted by PAPA JOHN'S for ABG's Approval hereunder, ABG shall provide PAPA JOHN'S with a reason for such disapproval.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specifics around the Approval Window (3 days for first and second requests, the process of submitting a second request, and the automatic approval upon silence), the obligation on ABG's part to respond to the request in a specific time frame is unclear. Because 3.E.4 relies on the 'Approval Window' this now creates an inconsistency as the term is no longer clearly defined. What is now 'reasonable' will need to be defined.",

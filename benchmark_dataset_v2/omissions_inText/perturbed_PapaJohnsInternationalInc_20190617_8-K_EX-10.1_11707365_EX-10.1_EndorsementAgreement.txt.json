                "explanation": "By removing \"subject to the provisions hereof, ...solely as Approved (as hereinafter defined) by ABG\" from the definition of Celebrity Endorsement, the contract now allows for potentially unapproved uses of the endorsement, which contradicts Section 3.A which grants the right and license 'subject to ABG's Approval (as hereinafter defined)'. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because it's unclear whether all uses of the endorsement must be approved.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'but subject to ABG's Approval in each instance' from the section on social media posts creates a contradiction. Section 3.D states ABG has the right to Approve all uses of the Celebrity Endorsement, but this section now implies that social media posts do not need approval. This creates a loophole regarding ABG's control over the Celebrity Endorsement.",

With this portion omitted, it is less clear how the indemnification obligations of ABG and Papa John's interact, and potential overlaps may now exist leading to ambiguity in specific scenarios regarding who bears the financial risk.",

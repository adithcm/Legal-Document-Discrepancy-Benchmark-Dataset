                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to \"Tier 1 Subscriber help-desk and support function\" and Schedule B, the contract becomes ambiguous. Other sections may still refer to the Tier 1 support or details in Schedule B, creating an internal contradiction as the detailed definition and requirements are now missing.",

                "explanation": "Removing \"Listed in Schedule \"A\"\" creates an ambiguity as to where the list of available services can be found. If Section 7 and other areas of the contract refer to the definitions, products or pricing within Schedule A, it will not make sense, as the section it is referring to, will no longer exist. This creates a contradiction.",

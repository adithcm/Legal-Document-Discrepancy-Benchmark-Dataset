                "original_text": "(o) Heritage represents and warrants that:\n\n(i) All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\"), shall conform to Post Holdings' Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage. No change in Specifications shall be binding on Heritage until Premier has provided written Specifications for each SKU, and each Specification is signed and dated by the Parties. Any additional net cost increases or decreases associated with any modifications to Premier's Specifications shall be borne by or credited to Premier.\n\n(ii) Heritage and Jasper will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to production of the Products, including without limitation, the laws and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), United States Public Health Service (\"PHS\"), and any and all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Heritage warrants that the Products shall be released free from defects in workmanship and shall be manufactured in accordance with this Agreement and 21 C.F.R. Part 110 which is entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing or Holding Human Food\" and as it may be amended from time-to-time.\n\n(iii) The Products, when delivered to Premier in accordance with this Agreement, shall be free of contaminants, merchantable, fit for intended use and shall not be adulterated within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\n(iv) Heritage and Jasper hold all permits and licenses required for Heritage and/or Jasper to manufacture the Products under the Agreement. Heritage will obtain, and shall ensure that Jasper obtains, all ingredients and packaging materials from suppliers that are approved by Premier in writing.",

                "explanation": "By omitting explicit requirements to 'conform to Post Holdings' Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E' and removing the guarantee against adulteration under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, this change undermines the product's guaranteed quality and regulatory compliance. Moreover, by deleting the words 'all' and replacing them with 'some' introduces an internal contradiction that leads to uncertainty in enforcement because it suggests that not all regulations or necessary licenses are being adhered to, conflicting with the implied warranty of full compliance.",

In addition, Premier shall indemnify, defend and hold Heritage harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of or relating to: (i) Heritage's adherence to the Product Specifications, identified in Schedule A, or written orders or instructions given by Premier to Heritage relating to the manufacture or packaging of Products; (ii) Premier's breach of any of its obligations contained herein; and (iii) the storage, sale, marketing, distribution and consumption of the Products, other than any Losses which would be covered under Section 7(b) hereof.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'defend and hold harmless', the modified text weakens Premier's indemnification obligations. While still responsible for indemnifying Heritage, Premier is no longer explicitly required to defend against claims or hold Heritage harmless. This omission creates a contradiction, as the original intent was to provide comprehensive protection, but the new version significantly reduces the scope of that protection. The removal of 'any and all' creates a ambiguity as to what extent Heritage will be protected.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'pursuant to Premier's instructions for delivery to Premier as set forth herein' from the first two sentences and omitting 'during shipment between the Heritage Facilities pursuant to Section 2', the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the specific conditions under which title and risk of loss transfer. The omission of 'pursuant to Premier's instructions for delivery to Premier as set forth herein' suggests that any delivery to a carrier transfers the title. Also, risk of loss now appears to be transferred in any situation, even when not stated.",

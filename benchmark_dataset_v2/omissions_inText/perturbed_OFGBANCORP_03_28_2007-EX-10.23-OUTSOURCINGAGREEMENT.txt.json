                "explanation": "By changing the interest calculation from a fixed reference (Citibank prime rate) to 'a rate to be determined by Metavante,' this modification introduces an open-ended element that allows Metavante unilaterally change the interest rate. The reference to 'the highest rate permitted by law' is removed, creating uncertainty in enforcement and potentially allowing Metavante to set arbitrary rates.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specific dollar amounts for insurance coverage (e.g., three million dollars, ten million dollars), while keeping the requirement for specific types of insurance, the modified text introduces uncertainty. The specific limits provide a definitive measure of protection. Without it, the adequacy of coverage becomes subjective. The phrase 'if available at a reasonable cost' is removed, but without specified dollar limits, it will be hard to determine reasonable cost. This makes it more difficult for the Customer to ensure Metavante is adequately insured.",

                "explanation": "By changing shall to may in Section B and replacing shall work with consider in Section C, the mandatory obligation to comply with changes in legal requirements becomes optional. This creates an inconsistency because Section A still implies that the customer has to make its systems consistent with legal requirements while Metavante, the provider, doesn't need to. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it is not clear which party must ensure the services remain compliant with legal requirements.",

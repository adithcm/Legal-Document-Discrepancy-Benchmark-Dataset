                "explanation": "By removing the specific amount ($10,000), the section refers to 'Cash Payments' without a defined amount. This makes enforcement uncertain because the 'Consideration' section is now ambiguous. While the need for the social communication is still in effect, the method of receiving the 'cash payments' has been altered.",

Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term.

                "explanation": "By removing the line 'Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved', there is no longer a timeframe for approval.

ESSI's reach will now be affected because the territory constraint has been removed, while the territory definitions are still in Paragraph 3. The enforceability of what is defined as a breach of contract has now been widened, creating an in-text contradiction.",

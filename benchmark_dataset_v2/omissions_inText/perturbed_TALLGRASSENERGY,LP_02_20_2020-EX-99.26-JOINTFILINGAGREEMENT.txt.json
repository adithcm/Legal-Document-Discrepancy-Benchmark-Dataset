            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \"Exchange Act\") the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party under Section 13 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of any filing required by such party with respect to securities of Tallgrass Energy, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and further agree to the filing of this Agreement as an exhibit thereto. The specifics of said agreement will be determined at a later date.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder, the agreement loses its legal foundation. The added sentence introduces ambiguity regarding the agreement's specific requirements, contradicting the implicit understanding that a joint filing agreement adheres to regulatory standards.",
                "location": "Paragraph 1"
            },
            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is generally responsible for the filings. The extent of that responsibility will be decided at a later date.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause specifying responsibility for 'timely filing', 'completeness', and 'accuracy' introduces ambiguity. The edited text suggests a shared responsibility, but removes the explicit limitations on liability (i.e., not being responsible for other filers' information), thereby potentially contradicting the original intent. The added sentence removes the specificity around responsibility and accuracy.",
                "location": "Paragraph 1"

            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by any party hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto, and then only with respect to such revoking party.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in effect. Revocation is at the discretion of the board.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause outlining the specific procedure for revocation (signed writing to each party), the modified text creates uncertainty. It contradicts the original by empowering 'the board' rather than each individual party, and by making the conditions for revocation unclear, impacting the enforceability and intended longevity of the agreement.",

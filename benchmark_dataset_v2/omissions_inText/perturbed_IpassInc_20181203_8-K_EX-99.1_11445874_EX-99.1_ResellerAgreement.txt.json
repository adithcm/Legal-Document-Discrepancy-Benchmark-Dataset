In no event may Channel Partner resell or otherwise provide the Service to any third party for purposes of further \"down channel\" resale of the Services, absent iPass' notice and consent.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all services of the nature of the Services' to 'certain services' creates ambiguity. It's unclear which services iPass is the exclusive provider for. This creates a contradiction because later sections may assume exclusivity for all services, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

The original text clearly points to a specific document, which is now omitted, and replaced with a ambiguous statement, which creates a contradiction if later sections refer to specifics within the original AUP, or expect strict adherence to the original AUP.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'such changes may include, by way of example only, the application of end of life fees', removes the explicit mention of end-of-life fees being a possible price change. If end-of-life fees are introduced later without specific agreement or a separate contractual section outlining them, it could create a contradiction since the modified clause doesn't clearly encompass them. Later sections calculating profits could have uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'will provide the most preferential policies and all-round service', it creates ambiguity. Later sections may still reference 'preferential policies', but the specific commitment to providing them has been omitted. This omission makes enforcement uncertain, as Party A's obligations are no longer clearly defined and can be claimed with 'local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction' in Section V",

If later sections refer to comprehensive development plans, there's a contradiction because the initial commitment is absent. The 'comprehensive development' and 'relevant national stipulations' are undefined and now the section is open for interpretation, leading to difficulty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'foreign-funded' and '; Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction' creates an issue. Section I states that 'Party A supports and guarantees the project construction and development of Party B, and will provide the most preferential policies and all- round service'. This section now loses the context of 'foreign investment promotion', meaning there is no longer a guarantee of 'preferential policies' for foreign-funded companies.",

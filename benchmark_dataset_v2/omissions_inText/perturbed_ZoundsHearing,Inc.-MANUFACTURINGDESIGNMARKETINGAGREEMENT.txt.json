                "original_text": "3.3 Product Prices. Pricing shall be the actual cost of the manufacturing of each Manufacturer's Product plus the proportional allocation of the costs of Subcontractor's manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain overhead, as mutually agreed by the Parties (the \"Product Cost\"). Title of the product will transfer to the Manufacturer at the shipping dock of the manufacturing facility. Manufacturer will be responsible for shipping costs. Manufacturer shall pay any taxes incurred in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products, including any taxes incurred as a result of purchasing components or maintaining inventory. In addition to the Royalties paid under this Agreement to the Subcontractor, Manufacturer shall pay any other third-party royalties for technology that are required to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products for their intended purpose. As of the date of this Agreement neither Party is aware of any third-party royalties for technology that Manufacturer would be liable to pay. Subcontractor will provide Manufacturer with documentation substantiating any Product Cost variance upon request.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase defining \"Product Cost\" as the actual manufacturing cost plus proportional allocation of overhead *as mutually agreed by the Parties*, the modified text creates uncertainty. Later references to \"Product Cost\" in Section 3.4 and 3.5 (Cost Reductions and Royalties) are now ambiguous because there is no longer a clear definition of how it is calculated. This weakens the enforceability of those sections.",

In addition to paying the Product Costs of Manufacturer's Products, Manufacturer shall also pay to Subcontractor the following royalty payments (each a \"Royalty\" and collectively the \"Royalties\") for each of Manufacturer's Product purchased under this Agreement. Royalties shall be paid 50% at time of shipping and the remaining balance of 50% due in 15-days after the Manufacturer's Products have shipped from the manufacturing facility. a) Non-Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are non-rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) eighty percent (80.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $80 per unit. b) Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) one hundred percent (100.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $100 per unit.",

                "explanation": "By removing the royalty rates listed in (a) and (b), the contract still requires royalty payments but provides no means of calculating the amount, leaving the rates undefined. This creates a contradiction because the contract refers to \"Royalty\" payments but then eliminates the specifics to calculate these, rendering royalty enforcement impossible. The reference to 'Royalty for each unit' is vague and unenforceable, because the contract still references a royalty payment but does not provide a method to calculate it.",

                "explanation": "The removal of \"that does not utilize any of Subcontractor's technology\" from (a) and the removal of  \"including the Product Costs and the costs as provided in Section 3.8\" from both (a) and (c) create ambiguity and contradiction. In (a) it is uncertain what kind of inventory Subcontractor may assist with. It now just says \"generic\". Both (a) and (c) sections now refer to 'cancellation charges' without specifying how these charges will be calculated, referencing Section 3.8 which is no longer related to 'cancellation charges'. This omission makes enforcement of these cancellation charge provisions highly uncertain because the contract does not explain how they are determined.",

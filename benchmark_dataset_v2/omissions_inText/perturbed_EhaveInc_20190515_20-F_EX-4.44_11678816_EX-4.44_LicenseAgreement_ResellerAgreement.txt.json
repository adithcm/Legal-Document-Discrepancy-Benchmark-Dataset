                "explanation": "By removing clause (i), the contract no longer explicitly warrants that the Ehave Companion Solution will conform to the Specifications. However, other sections, such as Section 6(f)(i), reference the Specifications, creating an inconsistency. This omission leads to uncertainty about the required functionality and features of the solution and uncertainty in enforcement, as CHT may claim the system does not conform to agreed-upon specifications, but the explicit warranty is missing.",

                "explanation": "By removing clause (i), the audit rights are limited only to verify Royalty calculations. However, Section 8(d) mentions security audits.

                "changed_text": "CHT agrees to pay the Royalties and applicable taxes.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Schedule 6', the specifics around royalties and payment terms are removed. Section 17(c)(iv) mentions CHT's payment obligations under Section 7. But now without 'Schedule 6' defining the Royalties and payments terms, any obligation around the value and timing for payments becomes ambigious. This creates a contradiction as there is no clear information about the Royalties",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific requirements for when Collections must be deposited, the agreement introduces ambiguity. Section 4.3(b)(ii) detailing specific deposit timelines is eliminated. This creates an inconsistency if Section 3.5(d) still references a 'written report' tied to the original deposit schedule, as the trigger for that report (the specific deposit timeline) no longer exists. Furthermore, by stating 'standard banking practices' without defining it, is vague. Other sections may rely on the specifics mentioned in this section.",

On each Payment Date, the Issuer will pay the Servicing Fee to the Servicer according to Section 8.2 of the Indenture. In addition, the Servicer may retain any Supplemental Servicing Fees. The Servicer will also receive the Temporarily Excluded Receivables Servicing Fee on each Payment Date, which will be payable solely from Collections on the Temporarily Excluded Receivables, as set forth in Section 3.5(b).",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of Servicing Fee and Supplemental Servicing Fees and changing it to 'fees as determined by the Servicer's internal policies', creates contradiction and uncertainty in other sections. For example: section 8.2 of the Indenture may refer to the Servicing Fee, however, there is no such definition of this fee, nor is there a Supplemental Servicing Fee, the amounts and methods of fees can change without constraints. This creates uncertainty and enforceability.",

Any such monthly credit granted to an Obligor shall be applied directly against the monthly payment due on the new device payment plan agreement and will not be applied in accordance with the Servicer's customary payment application procedures pursuant to its Servicing Procedures, if different. For the avoidance of doubt, if during such time as Cellco is no longer the Servicer, an Obligor remits the full amount due under the related new device payment plan agreement, but does not make a payment to the new Servicer for the original device payment plan agreement, a portion of such amount equal to the amount of the monthly credit granted to such Obligor resulting from the Upgrade Offer in respect of the original device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable shall be paid by Cellco to the new Servicer. In such case, to the extent that all other amounts owed on the related account are current, the Servicer will not consider such account or payments under the new device payment plan agreement to be Delinquent. In addition, regardless of whether Cellco continues to be the Servicer of any Receivable for which the terms and conditions of an Upgrade Offer (other than the requirement that the Marketing Agent remit, or cause the related Originator to remit, an Upgrade Payment for such Receivable) were satisfied by the related Obligor and for which the Marketing Agent, the related Originator and the Parent Support Provider failed to make the related Upgrade Payment, Cellco shall remit any Collections received on such Receivable to the Collection Account in the time period in which it would have been otherwise obligated to do so.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause on how to deal with credits to obligors and what should happen if payment are not done, the contract becomes unenforceable. By removing all guidance, other sections reference nonexistent processes or payment responsibilities. Removing 3.12, specifically (a) and (b), removes the instructions for handling unfulfilled upgrade offers, making Section 3.13's reference to those recoupment rights inconsistent. The modified section doesn't obligate the servicer to provide notice.",

Developer shall use its best efforts to retain qualified real estate professionals (including licensed brokers) to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco® Restaurant(s). Developer shall submit proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco® Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for acceptance by Franchisor's Real Estate Site Approval Committee (\"RESAC\"), together with such site information as may be reasonably required by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site, no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as RESAC Submittal Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement. Should the site be accepted by RESAC, it will be referred to as the \"Approved Site\". Such acceptance will expire one (1) year from the RESAC approval date. Franchisor may require, as a condition to its approval of a site, a \"Market Study\", which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require. All such analyses, information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.",

Removing \"no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit 'B' as RESAC Submittal Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement\" and changing \"as may be reasonably required by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site\" to \"as Franchisor requires\", allows for an indefinite submission timeframe and unclear requirements. The phrase \"which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require\" is missing, which introduces an unquantified Market Study. Changing \"sole cost and expense of Developer\" to \"cost and expense of a mutually agreed party\" gives rise to uncertainty in the payment.",

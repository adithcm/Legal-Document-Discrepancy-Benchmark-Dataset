                "changed_text": "b) \"SERVICES PERIOD\" means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties. The Services Period is subject to the discretion of Berkshire Bank.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines the 'SERVICES PERIOD' with a specific end date (May 31, 2014). The modified text removes the end date and introduces ambiguity by stating it is 'subject to the discretion of Berkshire Bank'. This directly contradicts later clauses (e.g., Schedule A specifying services 'during the Services Period') because the duration of that period is no longer fixed or guaranteed, creating uncertainty in enforcement of Auriemma's obligations.",

COMPENSATION.\n\n(a) In consideration of the rights and benefits granted to Berkshire hereunder, Berkshire shall pay to Auriemma the sum of Four  Hundred Eighty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($480,000.00), as set forth in Paragraph 4 (b)-(c) below.\n\n(b) Berkshire will make four (4) equal cash payments to Auriemma in the amount of Ninety Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($90,000.00) on  June 1, 2012, June 1, 2013, June 1, 2014, and June 1, 2015.\n\n(c) Berkshire will cause to be issued to Auriemma on June 1, 2012, June 1, 2013, June 1, 2014, and June 1, 2015, (each an \"issuance  date\") four (4) blocks of shares of unrestricted common stock of Berkshire's parent corporation, Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. (BHLB), each of  which as of its respective issuance date shall have a value of Thirty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($30,000.00), based upon the closing price of  BHLB common shares at the end of the last trading day immediately preceding the issuance date.",

COMPENSATION.\n\n(a) In consideration of the rights and benefits granted to Berkshire hereunder, Berkshire shall pay to Auriemma compensation as determined by Berkshire Bank, as potentially set forth in Paragraph 4 (b)-(c) below.\n\n(b) Berkshire may make cash payments to Auriemma on dates determined by Berkshire Bank.\n\n(c) Berkshire may cause to be issued to Auriemma shares of unrestricted common stock of Berkshire's parent corporation, Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. (BHLB).",
                "explanation": "The original section provides a fixed compensation schedule. The modified version introduces considerable ambiguity, making all forms of compensation discretionary. This contradicts Auriemma's expectation of receiving a specific sum as defined in Section 4(a) of the original text, significantly impacting the enforceability of the compensation terms and creating a material in-text contradiction.",

Unless such  election is made in writing, all cash payments shall be made by check, drawn to the order of Auriemma or its designated entity or entities and  delivered to the address first stated above. Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the  applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",
                "changed_text": "5. PAYMENTS. Auriemma may elect to have cash payments due Auriemma hereunder made by a method determined solely by Berkshire Bank. Past due cash payments may be subject to penalties as determined by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the payment methods and specifies a 1% monthly interest rate for past due payments. The modified version removes the specific payment methods, making the method discretionary for Berkshire Bank. Additionally, it replaces the defined interest rate with a vague reference to penalties 'as determined by applicable law,' omitting the previously agreed-upon rate, creating contradiction. While a party is bound to follow law, in contracts, it's assumed to follow a mutually agreed upon method and this removes that agreement and leaves it up to interpretation of the law, which introduces contradiction.",

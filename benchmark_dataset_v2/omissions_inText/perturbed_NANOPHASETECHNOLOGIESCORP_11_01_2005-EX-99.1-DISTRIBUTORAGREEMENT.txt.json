                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means quantities purchased and distributed. The exact limitations are subject to change based on the most current research practices and market trends.\n\n1.4 \"Commercial Quantities\" means quantities exceeding Research Quantities as determined by mutual agreement between NTC and ALFA AESAR.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific quantity limits (54kg/60kg) for Research and Commercial Quantities introduces ambiguity. The changed text defines 'Research Quantities' vaguely, making it difficult to objectively determine whether a sale falls under 'Research' or 'Commercial'. This contradicts section 2.1 (NTC grants to ALFA AESAR the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Research Quantities of the Products) and section 2.2 (NTC reserves for itself the right to sell Commercial Quantities of the Products), creating uncertainty about which party is authorized to sell specific quantities and undermines the exclusivity granted to ALFA AESAR. The reference to 'mutual agreement' makes the definition subjective and unenforceable without consensus.",

Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR.

In the event such efforts do not resolve the dispute, either party may initiate Arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 16.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'Net 30 day basis' payment term and the 'finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR', the contract no longer specifies when payment is due or what penalties apply for late payments. This omission directly contradicts the implied expectation of timely payment and creates uncertainty in enforcement. While the parties are expected to 'work in good faith', the lack of a defined payment period and penalty makes it difficult to determine what constitutes a breach of payment obligations. This creates contradiction with the NTC Standard terms and conditions set forth in Schedule B.",

Subject to the protocol in Section 5.1, ALFA AESAR may return to NTC any Product that is defective or that fails to comply with the purchase order provided by ALFA AESAR. NTC shall return to ALFA AESAR as promptly as possible, a working replacement or, in the event such replacement is not possible or at ALFA AESAR's election, it shall credit ALFA AESAR's account for the invoiced price and shipping charges of the defective Product. The correction of such defective Product shall be at no cost to ALFA AESAR. The cost of shipping the replacement Product back to ALFA AESAR shall be paid by NTC. THE CORRECTION OF SUCH DEFECT BY REPAIR OR CREDITING ALFA AESAR'S ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF THE PRODUCT IN THE MANNER SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF DISTRIBUTOR WITH RESPECT TO ANY WARRANTY GIVEN HEREIN RELATING TO ANY PRODUCT SOLD OR DELIVERED HEREUNDER.",

Subject to the protocol in Section 5.1, ALFA AESAR may return to NTC any Product that is defective or that fails to comply with the purchase order provided by ALFA AESAR. NTC shall provide a remedy for the defective product. The specific solution will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "Removing the detailed description of remedies (replacement or credit) for defective products and replacing it with 'NTC shall provide a remedy for the defective product' creates an omission that leads to inconsistency. By omitting the specific remedies of either replacing or crediting the account, the provision is vague, unenforceable, and open to interpretation. The statement 'The specific solution will be determined on a case-by-case basis' adds further ambiguity. This omission directly contradicts the original clear stipulation of the 'sole and exclusive remedy,' making the warranty and its enforcement highly uncertain. The omission creates a false sense of remedy without providing defined requirements, creating inconsistency.",

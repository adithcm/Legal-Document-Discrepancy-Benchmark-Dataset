Licensee shall not enter into any agreement referred to in this Article 2 with any Redistributor or Customer until each such agreement has been submitted to and approved by Licensor.  Within five (5) business days after its receipt of any such agreement, Licensor shall notify Licensee whether it approves or disapproves of the agreement and, if it disapproves of the agreement, Licensor shall provide written notice of the reasons therefor, including any changes that would require to approve of the agreement.  If Licensor fails to notify Licensee of its approval or disapproval of any such agreement within such period of time, the agreement shall be deemed to be approved by Licensor.",

                "explanation": "The original Section 2.5 mandated Licensor approval for any agreement between the Licensee and Redistributors/Customers. The modified version eliminates the need for Licensor approval, which contradicts the original intent of the agreement and could lead to disputes over the terms and conditions of sublicenses, thereby creating uncertainty.",

Licensee shall honor any proper refund or replacement requests received for the Licensed Products from Redistributors pursuant to the applicable Redistributor Agreement or from Customers pursuant to a Sublicense.

                "explanation": "The original Section 7.8 obligated the Licensee to honor refund or replacement requests and specified that Licensor would refund the Licensee. The modified text makes these actions discretionary ('may consider'), creating an inconsistency in the obligations of the Licensee and contradicting the expected flow of refunds between the Licensee and Licensor. This can cause confusion and disputes regarding warranty and customer support.",

The duties of Licensor include the following:\n\n     (a)  Delivering a Master Copy of each Licensed Product and Documentation,           including any Upgrades as they become available, to permit Licensee to           (1) make Sublicense Copies and copies of the Documentation to meet the           demand of Redistributors and Customers and (2) market and license           Sublicense Copies and copies of the Documentation, together with the           copies of promotional and other materials which Licensor may produce           from time to time in order to assist Licensee in marketing and           sublicensing the Licensed Products during the term of this Agreement.\n\n     (b)  Employing a sufficient number of skilled technicians experienced in           the computing industry and familiar with the Licensed Products and           Documentation to provide adequate technical support and assistance to           all Redistributors and Customers.\n\n     (c)  Providing competent instruction to Redistributors and Customers           regarding the use and installation of the Licensed Products.\n\n     (d)  Providing information, including by means of telephone support, to           Redistributors and Customers as to the proper procedures and persons           to contact to enable the proper installation and operation of the           Licensed Products and providing responsive answers to questions and           problems regarding the use and operation of the Licensed Products.\n\n     (e)  Providing technical assistance in supporting the Licensed Products and           correcting any errors in the Licensed Products on an ongoing basis.\n\n     (f)  Delivering to Licensee sample copies of all Licensor's marketing and           licensing materials relating to the Licensed Products in use in the           United States of America for copying and distribution in the Territory           at Licensee's expense.",

                "explanation": "The original Section 8.1 placed responsibility on Licensor to provide maintenance and support directly to Redistributors and Customers. The modified version limits Licensor's support obligation to only Licensee, contradicting the original intent and creating a conflict about the level of support Redistributors and Customers should expect. Also, the switch from 'shall be solely responsible' to 'will use commercially reasonable efforts' weakens the commitment.",

The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain Honeywell IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, \"Honeywell Shared IP\"). With regard 4\n\nto the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have-made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.\n\n(b) Trademarks. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain rights and obligations with respect to the use by the SpinCo Group of certain Honeywell Trademarks shall be set forth in the Trademark License Agreement. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Trademark License Agreement, the terms of the Trademark License Agreement shall control.\n\n(c) Additional Licenses.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to the terms of a license to Honeywell IP pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable member of the SpinCo Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of such Honeywell IP (it being understood that such challenge is the sole remedy available to SpinCo in the event Honeywell does not grant such license, without regard to whether Honeywell has negotiated in good faith).",

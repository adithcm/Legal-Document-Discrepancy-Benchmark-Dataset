                "original_text": "1. DEFINITIONS 1.1. Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such party.",
                "changed_text": "1. DEFINITIONS 1.1. Affiliate shall mean any entity associated with a party. The exact meaning of 'associated' is subject to mutual agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provided a specific criterion for 'control' (50% ownership). The modified definition removes this specific criterion, introducing ambiguity and potentially conflicting interpretations of what constitutes an 'Affiliate'. Other clauses relying on a clear definition of 'Affiliate' now become uncertain.",

PaperExchange Revenue shall mean the gross revenue received by PaperExchange from Transaction Fees less (a) credits for claims, allowances, retroactive price reductions or returned goods, and (b) sales, excise, use, value-added and other similar taxes (excluding income taxes) actually paid.",

                "explanation": "The original definition clearly outlined what constitutes PaperExchange Revenue by specifying deductions for claims, allowances, and taxes. The modified definition removes these deductions, creating an inconsistency. Revenue sharing clauses later in the contract (e.g., Section 7.4) now lack a clear method of calculation.",

During the Term, VerticalNet shall have the exclusive right to arrange for the sale of ***** of the third party advertising inventory (which shall consist of a minimum of one advertisement per page on each of the \"Co-Branded Equipment,\" \"Co-Branded Careers,\" \"Resources\" and \"Home Page\" sections or successor, replacement or substitute sections) of the PaperExchange Site and shall be consistent with the amount of advertising on other business to business vertical sites on the PaperExchange Site (the \"Third Party Advertising Allocation\"). PaperExchange shall retain the right to place advertisements for its own account on the remaining ***** of the Third Party Advertising Allocation; provided, however, that if any portion of such Third Party Advertising Allocation remains unsold 45 days after it becomes available for advertising, VerticalNet shall have the exclusive right to arrange for third party advertising on such unsold Third Party Advertising Allocation.",

VerticalNet has the 'right to sell a portion'. This contradiction creates uncertainty in enforcement because the degree of exclusivity is undefined. It references the Third Party Advertising Allocation but does not define it.",

                "explanation": "This modifies the definition of 'PaperExchange Competitor' to include a completely unrelated entity, while Section 2.2 continues to restrict VerticalNet from providing content to sites co-branded with the original definition of a 'PaperExchange Competitor'. This creates a contradiction making enforcement uncertain, as a retail office supply store would likely not be considered a competitor in the context of pulp and paper sales.",

PaperExchange shall retain the right to place advertisements for its own account on the remaining ***** of the Third Party Advertising Allocation; provided, however, that if any portion of such Third Party Advertising Allocation remains unsold 45 days after it becomes available for advertising, VerticalNet shall have the exclusive right to arrange for third party advertising on such unsold Third Party Advertising Allocation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific details about the 'Third Party Advertising Allocation', and the percentages associated with it, the modified clause gives both parties a general right to sell advertising, eliminating the defined structure and creating a contradiction.

INSURANCES\n9.1 In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme.\n9.2 The Executive is entitled to membership of a Group income protection plan and life assurance cover, which will be paid for by the Company.\n9.3 Participation in all insurance schemes from time to time is subject to: (a) the terms of the relevant insurance scheme, as amended from time to time; (b) the rules or the insurance policy of the relevant insurance provider, or WPP Healthcare Trust as amended from time to time; and (c) the Executive (and where relevant any other potential beneficiary) satisfying the normal underwriting requirements of the relevant insurance provider and the premium being at a rate which the Company considers reasonable.\n9.4 If the insurer refuses for any reason to provide the benefit to the Executive (or any relevant dependant) the Company shall not be liable to provide to the Executive any replacement benefit of the same or similar kind or to pay any compensation in lieu of such benefit. Full details of the insurance schemes are available from the Company's Worldwide Compensation and Benefits Director.\n9.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's sole obligations in respect of the insurance benefits referred to in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2 is to pay the premia from time to time requested by the provider and to pay to the Executive any sums as may from time to time be received by the Company from the provider in respect of any claim made by the Executive (for him or a dependent) under any insurance scheme.\n9.6 The Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to alter the cover provided or any term of any insurance scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) any insurance scheme or cover at any time.\n9.7 The Executive is entitled to the benefit of any indemnity in the Company's articles of association and may also entitled to the benefit of cover under such directors and officers liability insurance policy as may be maintained by the Company from time to time.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Executive's explicit entitlement to specific insurance schemes (private medical, group income protection, life assurance) and replacing it with a vague reference to 'available insurance schemes, subject to eligibility,' the contract creates uncertainty. Earlier clauses mentioned a fixed benefits allowance in clause 6.1, which creates an expectation of specific benefits, contradicted by the discretionary nature now implied in Clause 9. This can be interpreted as the executive is not entitled to those insurances at all.",

If, at the Termination Date, the Executive has taken more holiday than he has accrued, the Executive hereby expressly consents to the Company deducting an appropriate amount from any payments otherwise due him.

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the entitled paid holiday is '25 days' a year. By removing this number and replacing it with vague reference to 'Details regarding accrued but untaken holiday can be found in internal HR policies', it creates a potential conflict. If the contract claims compliance with employment laws elsewhere, but the internal policies offer fewer than legally mandated holidays, an in-text contradiction arises. Furthermore, it also omits the calculation and deduction of unaccrued holidays taken.",

                "explanation": "By changing the notice period from '12 months' to 'reasonable notice', the contract introduces ambiguity.

The changed text omits this exclusion, creating an ambiguity as to whether bonuses and accrued holiday should be included in the PILON calculation. This can be interpreted as the executive is entitled to those items as part of the payment in lieu of notice.",

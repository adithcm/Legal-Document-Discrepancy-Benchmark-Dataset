If, at the Termination Date, the Executive has taken more holiday than he has accrued, the Executive hereby expressly consents to the Company deducting an appropriate amount from any payments otherwise due him. Deductions and payments in lieu of holiday are to be calculated on the basis that a day's holiday is equal to 1/260 of the Executive's basic salary.",

                "explanation": "By removing '25 days' paid holiday in addition to the usual public or bank holidays in England', the contract now states the Executive is entitled to paid holiday, without specifying the amount. This creates ambiguity because other sections (specifically 11.3) still reference holiday accrual and deductions, implicitly assuming a defined number of holiday days, which now does not exist.",

There will be no salary review after notice to terminate this Agreement has been given by either party. The Company has no obligation to increase the Executive's salary following a review. 6.3 The Executive will be eligible to participate in any bonus or discretionary remuneration plan on such terms as the Compensation Committee may from time to time decide and always subject to the terms of the Executive Remuneration policy as approved by shareholders of WPP plc and to additional terms and conditions including the malus and clawback provisions of all relevant share or stock plans and as referred to in Schedule 2.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and a fixed benefits allowance of £30,000 per annum' from 6.1, the contract removes a defined benefit. While this seems straight forward, clause 9.1 later states 'In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme.'. Now that the fixed benefits allowance is not defined, it's not clear if the Executive is still entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme.",

If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment in Lieu shall not include any element in relation to: (a) any bonus or discretionary payment(s) that might otherwise have been due during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made; and (b) any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made.",

                "explanation": "By removing ', benefit allowance' from 15.2, it contradicts clause 6.1 where it originally mentioned the salary and benefit allowance. The removal creates uncertainty as clause 15.2 provides that the Payment in Lieu covers 'basic salary and any benefits', now without reference to the 'benefit allowance'.",

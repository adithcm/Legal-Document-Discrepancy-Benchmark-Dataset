                "explanation": "By weakening the definition of 'Statement of Work,' and introducing uncertainty, the contract creates ambiguity regarding whether the Statement of Work actually exists, even though later clauses such as 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 4.1 rely on it.",

In full consideration for the rights granted              --------------------- by  NETTAXI,  SpinRecords.com  agrees  to  pay NETTAXI fifty (50%) percent of ad revenue  at  an  average  rate  no lower then $6.50 per one thousand impressions (CPM)  payable  to  NETTAXI  which  results when the SpinRecords.com Advertising Revenue  is  multiplied by SpinRecords.com's AR Share.  SpinRecords.com shall be responsible  for  payment  of  all taxes based on the Advertising Revenue except taxes  based  on  NETTAXI's  income.",

                "explanation": "The changed text removes the specific payment rate ($6.50 CPM and 50% ad revenue) introducing ambiguity, but retains the obligation to pay. This contradicts any expectation of precise financial terms, making it difficult to enforce the payment.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"7\" and changing \"shall not be required to pay any fee to SpinRecords.com after termination\" to \"may or may not be required to pay any fee to SpinRecords.com after termination.\" introduces ambiguity, since that contradicts with clause 8.2 which states  \"In  the  event  of  such  termination, Spinrecords.com  shall  be  entitled  to receive and retain all payments made or payable  by  NETTAXI  prior  to  the  date  of  termination.\" .",

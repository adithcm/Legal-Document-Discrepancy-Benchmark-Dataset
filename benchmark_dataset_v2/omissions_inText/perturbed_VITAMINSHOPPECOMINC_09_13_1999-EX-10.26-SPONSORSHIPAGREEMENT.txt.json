                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, Client's Competitors means those merchants identified in Exhibit D attached hereto. Client may update this list in writing not more than once every six (6) months by adding other merchants whose primary business is reselling Vitamins upon the mutual agreement of Excite.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may display links to Excite's own products and services anywhere in the Excite Network, and may display links to Client's Competitors in results pages of search services in response to user queries, in general directories of Web sites, in classified advertising listings and in results in the \"Jango\" shopping search service throughout the Excite Network.  Client's preferred and dominant status as a reseller of Vitamins will be extended on the terms stated in this Section l(a) to its presence within future departments within the WebCrawler Health Channel, when launched, which may include, but are not limited to, the alternative medicine and senior living departments.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit reference to 'Exhibit D' and the process by which Client may propose updates to Client's competitors in Section 1(a), the amended text grants Excite unilateral control over the definition of 'Client's Competitors.' This change introduces uncertainty as it removes a previously agreed upon list of competitors, creating potential disputes over which entities are actually considered competitors for sponsorship and advertising prominence purposes. As well as allowing Excite to choose who client's competitors are with no recourse. ",

                "explanation": "By removing the condition by which both parties determine the launch date and giving full control of defining the launch date to only Excite, makes the contract vague. Since the launch date is crucial for calculating fees, payment schedules, and the term of the agreement, giving Excite unilateral control creates uncertainty and potential disputes.",

                "original_text": "Excite guarantees to deliver the annual impressions totals set forth in Exhibit C hereto.  If Excite fails to deliver the indicated number of impressions required during any annual period, Client may suspend (but not eliminate) its payments specified in Section 7 for a maximum of sixty (60) days (the \"Make-Good Period) during which Excite will deliver the shortfall of such impressions.  The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to evaluate the quality and performance of the placements used to deliver the impressions during the Make-Good Period.  Until such shortfall is delivered, no impressions will be deemed delivered for the next annual period.  If Excite has not achieved the required annual impression delivery by the end of the Make-Good Period, Client may then terminate this Agreement upon written notice within ten (10) days following the end of the Make-Good Period.  Client's termination of the Agreement in accordance with the previous sentence will not relieve Excite of its obligation to deliver any previously paid for but undelivered impressions.  If Excite achieves the annual impression delivery goal at any time during the Make-Good Period, the term of this Agreement will continue and Client shall immediately resume payment of the sponsorship and advertising fees specified in Section 7.",
                "changed_text": "Excite will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver impressions. If Excite fails to deliver the indicated number of impressions, the parties shall negotiate in good faith an equitable resolution.",
                "explanation": "By removing the guaranteed annual impressions, the specific 'Make-Good Period', and Client's right to suspend payments or terminate the agreement in Section 9(e), the amended text significantly weakens Client's recourse for undelivered impressions. The ambiguity of 'commercially reasonable efforts' and 'negotiate in good faith' replaces the clear terms for addressing impression shortfalls, increasing uncertainty about consequences of under-delivery. The contract also removes Exhibit C, which holds the annual impression schedule which adds uncertainty as the company now has no guaranteed deliverable impressions.",

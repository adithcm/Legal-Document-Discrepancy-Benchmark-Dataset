                "explanation": "By removing the specific timeframe for updating the list of competitors (once every six months), and replacing 'not more than once every six months' with a general statement that updates require Excite's approval, we introduce uncertainty. The original text limits the number of times that Client may update the list of competitors. The new change does not address the question of how often the client may change the list, and if there are requirements for how many competitors are on that list.",

If Excite fails to deliver the indicated number of impressions required during any annual period, Client may suspend (but not eliminate) its payments specified in Section 7 for a maximum of sixty (60) days (the \"Make-Good Period) during which Excite will deliver the shortfall of such impressions. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to evaluate the quality and performance of the placements used to deliver the impressions during the Make-Good Period. Until such shortfall is delivered, no impressions will be deemed delivered for the next annual period. If Excite has not achieved the required annual impression delivery by the end of the Make-Good Period, Client may then terminate this Agreement upon written notice within ten (10) days following the end of the Make-Good Period. Client's termination of the Agreement in accordance with the previous sentence will not relieve Excite of its obligation to deliver any previously paid for but undelivered impressions. If Excite achieves the annual impression delivery goal at any time during the Make-Good Period, the term of this Agreement will continue and Client shall immediately resume payment of the sponsorship and advertising fees specified in Section 7.",

If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment  Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as \"Expense Waiver\") sufficient to produce a Net  Investment Income of zero.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definitions and the firm obligation to waive fees or reimburse, this creates uncertainty about how 'Net Investment Income' is calculated and what the Investment Adviser is actually required to do if it falls below zero. Later clauses reference 'Expense Waiver' (1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and Section 2), but its definition has been removed, making those sections ambiguous. It is no longer clear what constitutes an 'Expense Waiver', or if any action is to be taken.",

In no event, however, shall  the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless  the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case  such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable. If, and to  the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would cause the Fund's Net Investment Income  to fall below zero, such payment shall be deferred until such date on which the",

                "explanation": "This section refers to \"Expense Waiver\", which now has no definition (as edited in the first perturbation). The original text clearly defines conditions and limits for the recovery of payments, but this has been completely replaced. This implies that a payment could be a fee or other amount but has no context from earlier clauses. Since 1.1 was also removed, there is no reference to the underlying concept of 'Net Investment Income', so its meaning here becomes indeterminate. Since section 1.1 defines what 'Expense Waiver' actually *is*, this change breaks the ability to enforce that portion of the original contract, and also contradicts with 1.6, which states how the Fund is to make the payment to the Investment Adviser.",

                "explanation": "The original section outlines the conditions under which the agreement continues beyond the initial year, requiring approval by 'Non-Interested Trustees'. By removing this requirement, the modified text contradicts the intent of ensuring unbiased oversight. Additionally, this contradicts section 4.3, which says that definitions are the same and should be resolved by reference to the 1940 Act. While not contained in this specific document, the reference to the 1940 act requires those Non-Interested Trustees to approve the continuation of this Agreement. Finally, the removal of the right of recovery set forth in section 1.5 is nonsensical as this clause only contains the terms and duration, and should not have any impact on an earlier section.",

The royalties payable to Licensor           pursuant to Section 3.1 shall be payable in accordance with the           provisions of this Section 3.2.  On or before the first day of each           fiscal quarter of each fiscal year during the term hereof, commencing           with the Licensee's fiscal year which begins on April 1, 1999,           Licensee shall pay to Licensor, as an advance (a \"Royalty Advance\") of           royalties anticipated to be paid hereunder during such fiscal year, an           amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Annual Royalty           Advance Requirement for such fiscal year.  The aggregate amount of           Royalty Advances outstanding from time to time shall be credited           against royalties payable hereunder pursuant to Section 3.1 as and           when such royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with           generally accepted accounting principles.  Royalty Advances made           hereunder shall be made in respect of royalties that may become           payable in respect of any and all Licensed Products and shall not           be deemed made in respect\n\n                                          2\n\n          of any particular Licensed Product.  With respect to any royalty           payments due hereunder from Licensee to Licensor in excess of the           amount of Royalty Advances made by Licensee from time to time           hereunder, such payments shall be payable on the later of (i) sixty           (60) days after the date of the applicable invoice to a Redistributor           or Customer, as the case may be, or (ii) five (5) business days           following Licensee's receipt of payment from a Redistributor or           Customer, as the case may be.  Any royalty payment that is not paid           when due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the           date payment is made at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.            All royalty payments due to Licensor under this Agreement shall be           paid in U.S. Dollars.  Upon the expiration or any termination of this           Agreement, Licensor shall repay to Licensee the aggregate amount of           all Royalty Advances then outstanding.",

The modified text grants Licensor the sole discretion to determine payment terms, which creates an imbalance and uncertainty. Although the obligation to pay interest on late payments and to repay outstanding advances remains, the specific schedule and the concept of 'Royalty Advance' are effectively removed without removing the term itself creating a contradiction with section 1.12 and 6.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation removes the entire section 15.12 and significant details of section 15.11. Removing the specifics of what defines first right of refusal creates ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the clause. Without it, NEON system's rights are severely weakened, creating a significant inconsistency with the original intent of granting a meaningful first right of refusal and option to purchase. Skunkware Joinder references both sections, creating textual inconsistencies.",

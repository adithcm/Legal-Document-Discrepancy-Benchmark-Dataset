                "changed_text": "Definitions\n\n1.1 In this Agreement, including the recitals, except as expressly provided or unless  the context otherwise requires,\n\n(a) Affiliate means, in respect of a party hereto, entities with shared ownership.\n\n(b) Area of Non-Competition will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(c) Business Day means any day except Sundays.\n\n(d) Closing means the completion of certain transactions.\n\n(e) Designated Mineral Property means mineral interests.\n\n(f) Effective Date means a date agreed upon by both parties.\n\n(g) Mining Activities means any mineral exploration.\n\n(h) Person means any entity.",
                "explanation": "The modified definitions introduce ambiguity by generalizing key terms. For instance, 'Area of Non-Competition' is no longer specifically defined by geographic boundaries, but will be 'determined on a case-by-case basis', contradicting the specific geographic limitations mentioned in Section 2.1. This creates uncertainty about the scope of the non-competition clause, potentially making it unenforceable due to vagueness. The differences in each definition also create uncertainty, as it is impossible to understand the 'agreed upon' dates.",

                "explanation": "By changing '2 years' to 'a reasonable period,' the definiteness of the non-compete clause is compromised. Additionally, the phrase 'Area of Non-Competition', which is referenced in section 2.1, is now extremely vague, and creates ambiguity for enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Restrictions Reasonable\n\n3.3 Each of Western Copper and Glamis agree that the restrictions in this Agreement  are generally reasonable, and defences to the enforcement thereof are not waived.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all restrictions ... are reasonable and valid, and all defences ... are hereby waived' to 'the restrictions ... are generally reasonable, and defences ... are not waived,' the contract introduces a level of uncertainty about the enforceability of the restrictions. The original section strongly asserts the reasonableness and validity of all restrictions and eliminates any possibility of defenses against their enforcement. The revision softens this stance, acknowledging only general reasonableness and explicitly preserving the right to raise defenses. This modification causes a contradiction. The clause implies that the contract's terms are not immutable and could be subject to challenge, especially given the changes to the definitions in part 1.",

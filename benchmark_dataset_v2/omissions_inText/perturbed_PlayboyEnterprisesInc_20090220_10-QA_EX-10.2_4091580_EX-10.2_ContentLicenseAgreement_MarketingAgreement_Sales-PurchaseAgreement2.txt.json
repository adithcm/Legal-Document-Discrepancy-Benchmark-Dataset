(\"Playboy\"), and when used upon merchandise means that such merchandise is  sponsored, approved, recommended or sold by Playboy or its licensees; (ii) Supplier will not sell, ship or otherwise  dispose of any such merchandise except upon the order of Purchaser or Playboy; (iii) Supplier will never make, cause others to make or assist others in making, any claim whatsoever to any or all of the Playboy Properties or any trademark,  copyright, designation, name, phrase, design or symbol similar thereto in connection with the manufacture, advertising,  promotion, sale or distribution of merchandise; and (iv) Supplier will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and Playboy and the distributors and dealers and the officers and employees of each of the foregoing against all liability  whatsoever which may be incurred by them or any of them as a result of any alleged defects in material or workmanship  in the merchandise covered by this Contract.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"Playboy Properties\" and its association with Playboy Enterprises International, Inc. from the definition, and removing Playboy as an indemnitee, it creates an ambiguity and contradiction regarding the ownership and control of the Playboy Properties. The modified text reduces the explicit acknowledgement of Playboy's rights and responsibilities, conflicting with later sections that reference Playboy's rights as a third party beneficiary and the potential for prosecution for Playboy Properties infringement. The change from 'sponsored, approved, recommended or sold by Playboy or its licensees' to 'considered approved' further diminishes Playboy's explicit endorsement role, creating potential confusion about the standards for merchandise.",

                "explanation": "By removing Playboy's right to request the delivery or destruction of molds and designs, it contradicts Section 4, which establishes Playboy as a third-party beneficiary with specific rights. The deletion undermines Playboy's ability to protect its intellectual property, creating an inconsistency within the contract regarding Playboy's enforcement powers.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'PLAYBOY PROPERTIES INFRINGEMENT' as a cause of action, while Section 1 acknowledges (even in the modified version) some association with Playboy, the contract becomes contradictory. If the supplier infringes on the 'images and/or trademarks' used, it is unclear if this specific contract provides recourse for that infringement, creating uncertainty in enforcement and conflicting with the general intent of protecting intellectual property rights.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies maintenance scheduling. Removing the specified scheduling timeframe creates ambiguity. Later clauses referring to 'reasonable maintenance' now lack a clear definition of what is reasonable, leading to potential disputes about service uptime and permissible maintenance windows. The lack of defined timeframes can then affect the Customer's business as they wouldn't have a good idea when their webpage will be down for maintenance.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific software (Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or higher) and referencing allocated computer storage (#5 above), the agreement becomes vague. If #5 which defines computer storage gets removed, the clause will have little to no meaning.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines the amount and due date of the payment. Removing the specific amount ($450) and due date (5th of each month beginning April 1, 1999) creates ambiguity about the financial obligations. Although it still mentions 'recurring monthly fee', without a defined amount, it's unenforceable. It contradicts the expectation of a clear financial agreement because payment details are no longer concretely defined.",

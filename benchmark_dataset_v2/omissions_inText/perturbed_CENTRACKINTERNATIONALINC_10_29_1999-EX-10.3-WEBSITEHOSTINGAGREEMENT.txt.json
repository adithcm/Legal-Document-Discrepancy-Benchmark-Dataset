                "explanation": "By removing the detailed specifications for each service, such as the T1 line, the specific software versions, the storage limits (150 MB), and the 1-hour limit on Web site administration services, the modified text creates uncertainty and potential disputes. While the services are generally listed, the lack of specific parameters could allow i-on to provide significantly reduced or altered services compared to what the Customer might reasonably expect based on the original text. The term 'as deemed necessary by i-on' introduces an element of subjectivity that contradicts the initial intent of providing well-defined services. Also the $200 rate has been removed.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit mention of the amount i.e. '$450' creates an ambiguity regarding the payment obligation. While the customer is still responsible for paying the recurring monthly fee, the absence of a specified amount introduces uncertainty and could lead to disputes about the correct amount. The change weakens the enforcement because the precise amount to be paid is no longer defined.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific time periods (six months initial term, one-month renewal periods, and fifteen-day notice) introduces ambiguity. The lack of a defined period creates an indefinite arrangement which conflicts with standard contract practice and creates difficulty in determining the actual term of the agreement. The absence of the 15 days notic period affects enforcement.",

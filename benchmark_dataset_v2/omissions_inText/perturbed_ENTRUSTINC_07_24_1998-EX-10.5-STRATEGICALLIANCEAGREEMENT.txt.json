                "changed_text": "\"Patent License Term\" shall mean a period of ten years from the effective date.",
                "explanation": "The original text ties the 'Patent License Term' directly to ETI being a subsidiary of NTL. The modified text removes this dependency, creating a fixed term of ten years. This contradicts Section 6.11(a) which states 'Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Patent License shall terminate immediately upon ETI ceasing to be a Subsidiary of NTL.' Now, the definition of patent license term is at odds with a termination clause tied to the subsidiary relationship.",

Payments to Entrust for the support services identified in the Enterprise License as of the Effective Date shall be three hundred thousand U.S. dollars (U.S. $300,000.00) for the calendar year 1997 and shall not increase by more than inflation as measured by the Canadian CPI for any one-year renewal period.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.02 Support.  NTL may contract for support services under the Enterprise License.",
                "explanation": "By removing the payment terms and inflation cap, this section now contradicts the intention of specifying the payment structure. The rest of the document references the Enterprise License which originally had a specific cost defined within. The modified text still allows NTL to contract for support but creates ambiguity around the financial terms and the reference to inflation is now not useful.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Ontario, Canada law. The modified clause now refers to 'principles of international law.' This creates ambiguity and direct contradiction, as these two legal systems can significantly differ. The change introduces uncertainty around the interpretation of contract provisions. The choice of law has a huge impact on the outcome of a potential dispute. Making the governing law ambiguous creates legal risk.",

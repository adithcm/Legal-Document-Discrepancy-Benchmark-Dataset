You have the right to renew the franchise for two (2) successive terms equal to five (5) years each, providing you meet all of the following conditions: 1. You have, during the entire term, complied with all the provisions of the Agreement; 2. The premises of the Franchised Restaurant meet our then-current standards for Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants and you are able to maintain possession of the Franchised Restaurant. Before the expiration date of this Agreement you must bring the Franchised Restaurant into full compliance with the specifications and standards then applicable for new or renewing Buffalo Wild Wings businesses and present us with evidence satisfactory that you have the right to remain in possession of the Franchised Restaurant premises for the duration of the renewal term. In the event you are unable to maintain possession of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant or if the premises do not meet our then-current standards, you may secure substitute premises approved by us and provided that you have furnished, stocked and equipped such premises to bring the Franchised Restaurant at its substituted premises into full compliance with the then-current specifications and standards before the expiration date of this Agreement; 3. You have given us written notice of your desire to renew at least six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months prior to the end of the term; 4. You have satisfied all of your monetary obligations to us and our affiliates and have timely met these obligations throughout the term of this Agreement; 5. You have executed for the renewal term our then-current form of Franchise Agreement (with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that the agreement relates to the grant of a renewal franchise), which shall supersede in all respects this Agreement, and the terms of which may differ from the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, a different percentage Continuing Fee and advertising contribution; provided, however, that the percentage Continuing Fee shall not exceed seven percent (7%) during any renewal period. You will not be required to pay the then-current initial franchise fee or its equivalent; 6. You have complied with our then-current qualification and training requirements; and 7. You have executed a general release, in a form prescribed by us, of all claims against us and our affiliates, and respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders and employees.",

You have the right to renew the franchise, providing you meet all of the following conditions: 1. You have, during the entire term, substantially complied with all the major provisions of the Agreement; 2. You have given us written notice of your desire to renew at least six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months prior to the end of the term; 3. You have substantially satisfied all of your monetary obligations to us and our affiliates throughout the term of this Agreement; 4. You have executed for the renewal term our then-current form of Franchise Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change removes specific and objective criteria for franchise renewal, such as maintaining restaurant standards, possessing the right to remain in the premises, meeting qualification and training requirements and executing a general release. By only stating 'substantially complied' and 'substantially satisfied,' it introduces ambiguity and allows Franchisor's subjective interpretation, which creates uncertainty and potential disputes. Other contract sections rely on the removed sections to define 'compliance', thus creating contradictions.",

The Continuing Fee will be paid monthly in the manner specified below or as otherwise prescribed in the Manuals. 1. We must receive from you within five (5) days after the end of each month, a correct statement of your Gross Sales for the preceding fiscal month as determined by us on a form approved by us and signed by you. Each monthly statement of Gross Sales shall be accompanied by the Continuing Fee payment based on the Gross Sales reported in the statement so submitted. You will make available to us all original books and records that we may deem necessary to ascertain your Gross Sales for reasonable inspection at reasonable times. 2. The term \"Gross Sales\", as used in this Agreement, means and includes the total amount of all revenue from the sale of services, products and merchandise and all income of every kind and nature related to the Franchised Restaurant whether or not sold or performed at or from the Franchised Restaurant and the proceeds from all games, cover charges, service, license, use and similar fees collected by the Franchised Restaurant. Gross sales do not include any sales tax, use tax, or service taxes collected and paid to the appropriate taxing authority.",

You are in full compliance with this Agreement, you have no uncured defaults, all your fees, debts and financial obligations to us, our affiliates and the Fund are current, and you are current in your required local advertising expenditures; 2. You execute a written agreement in a form satisfactory to us in which you and your owners covenant to observe all applicable post-term obligations and covenants contained in this Agreement; 3.

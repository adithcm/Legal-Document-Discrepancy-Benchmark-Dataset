However, the Company will have the right to dispose of its inventory of Products existing at the time of termination or expiration of this Agreement and the right to use the name, likeness, image and personal identification of the Professional in connection with the disposition of such inventory. The right granted in this section shall expire six (6) months after the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The Professional understands and agrees that the Company shall have no obligation to take action against or attempt to stop distributors, retailers and other third parties to this Agreement who have purchased Products bearing the name, likeness, image or personal identification of the Professional from any marketing, advertising, sale or other disposition of such Products, regardless of any use they make of the name, likeness, image or personal identification of the Professional.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'the right to use the name, likeness, image and personal identification of the Professional in connection with the disposition of such inventory. The right granted in this section shall expire six (6) months after the termination or expiration of this Agreement', there is no longer a clear definition of how long the company can use the professional's likeness post-termination. However, section 3.1 refers to section 2.8. This causes a contradiction because section 2.8 no longer includes a definition.",

The contract becomes ambiguous as to what happens with unsold products at the end of the agreement. Specifically, if not renewed, there is no stipulation for a payment based on inventory. Section 9.1 references section 4.2, causing a contradiction since there is no mention of royalty for unsold inventory.",

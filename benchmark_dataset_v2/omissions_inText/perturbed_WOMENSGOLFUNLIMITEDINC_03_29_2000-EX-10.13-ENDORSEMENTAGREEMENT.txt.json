During the Term, the Company shall pay the Royalty Fee, earned for the preceding quarter, to the Professional quarterly, within thirty (30) days of the end of the succeeding calendar year quarter. If the Company decides not to renew this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 below, the Company shall pay the Professional an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the net book value of its unsold inventory of Products on December 31, 2004.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific calculation of the Royalty Fee (2% of Royalty Base) and changing 'shall pay' to 'may compensate', the payment terms become unclear. This contradicts the initial statement about paying a Royalty Fee, as the method of calculation and obligatory nature are now uncertain, creating ambiguity about the compensation structure and enforcement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause that the Professional use *only* the golf clubs and bags of the Company creates a loophole. While she agrees to use golf clubs and bags and avoid competitor apparel, she could use competitor clubs or bags, so long as they do not display competitor ID. This contradicts the implied exclusivity of the endorsement and creates a contradiction in the scope of services.",

On each March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 during the Term that the Company elects to continue the marketing and sale of the Products, the Company will grant to the Professional a number of Options (the \"Quarterly Grant Number\"). The Quarterly Grant Number shall be the nearest whole number that results from the division of the number of dollars represented by one half of one percent (0.5%) of the Royalty Base by the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The exercise price of the Options shall be the closing price of the Company stock on the grant date. The sum of the Quarterly Grant Numbers in each calendar year of the Term shall not exceed fifteen thousand (15,000). The options will expire five (5) years after each grant date. The Options shall not be assigned, transferred or alienated by the Professional. Any attempt to assign, transfer or alienate the Options without the prior written consent of the Company shall be void.",

                "explanation": "The specific formula for calculating the 'Quarterly Grant Number' has been removed. While the contract states that options will be granted quarterly, there's no longer a clear method for determining *how many* options are granted. This creates a contradiction because the commitment to grant options is vague without a defined quantity, impacting enforcement and creating uncertainty.",

DEFINITIONS 1.1 \"Designated Support Contact \" means Licensee's employee who is authorized to contact the XACCT support center. 1.2 \"Incident\" means a single, discrete, malfunction or other problem which may require more than one (1) response before it is closed. 1.3 \"Major Release\" means a version of the Product containing significant changes in functionality which usually will be designated with a whole number product version change such as 3.x to 4.x. 1.4 \"Minor Release\" means a version of the Product containing minor improvements which usually will be designated with a one (1) decimal version change such as 3.x to 3.x; also sometimes referred to as \"dot releases.\" 1.5 \"Product Maintenance\" means the Product updates and revisions that are available from XACCT and selected by Licensee, as further referenced herein and the attachments hereto as may be amended from time to time. 1.6 \"Support Services\" means the software support services that are available from XACCT and selected by Licensee, as further referenced herein and the attachments hereto as may be amended from time to time.",

                "explanation": "The omission of specific versioning details for 'Major Release' and 'Minor Release' and the removal of 'as further referenced herein and the attachments hereto as may be amended from time to time.' for 'Product Maintenance' and 'Support Services' creates ambiguity. Later sections, such as Section 2 and 4, reference Attachment 1 for details on support levels and fees. Removing the explicit link in the definitions section introduces a contradiction as the definitions become vague while other sections still rely on them. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes a Major or Minor release, and the scope of Product Maintenance and Support Services, impacting enforcement.",

Initial response times for reported Incidents are as set forth in Attachment 1. 3.2 In order for Licensee to receive the Support Services referenced above, Licensee must: (a) Appoint Designated Support Contact(s), trained and qualified, who will maintain the integrity of the&sbsp;Product and who will act as Licensee's liaison for all technical communications with XACCT. The number of Designated Support Contact(s) will be determined by the level of Support Services purchased by Licensee set forth in Attachment 1referenced in Section 2. Names of Designated Support Contact(s) must be provided to XACCT prior to initial contact with the XACCT support center. All technical communications by Licensee to XACCT shall only be made by the Designated Support Contact(s). All information and materials provided to Licensee by XACCT pursuant to this Agreement will be routed to the Designated Support Contact(s). Licensee may change the Designated Support Contact(s) upon written notice to XACCT; (b) Promptly obtain training on the use of the Product for the Designated Support Contact(s), and any other employee substituting or replacing the Designated Support Contact(s); (c) Subject to Licensee's applicable security requirements, provide XACCT with access to and use of all information and system facilities including but not limited to a modem connection to Licensee's systems determined necessary by XACCT to provide timely Support Services pursuant to this Agreement; (d) Follow operating instructions and procedures as specified in, but not limited to, XACCT's documentation and other correspondence related to the Product; (e) Follow procedures and recommendations provided by the XACCT support center in an effort to correct problems; or (f) Notify XACCT of a malfunction or other problem in accordance with XACCT's then current problem reporting procedures and as provided in Attachment 1.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'commercial efforts', 'appropriate solutions', and removing references to 'initial response times', the number of 'Designated Support Contact(s)', and 'Attachment 1' reduces the obligation of the support service, and introduces an omission that other sections reference. Because 'reasonable' and 'appropriate' are now undefined, and because 'Attachment 1' is no longer a part of the definition, the section now contradicts the rest of the document.",

Section 2 clearly defines that 'Licensee may purchase the level of Product Maintenance and Support Services set forth in Attachment 1'.

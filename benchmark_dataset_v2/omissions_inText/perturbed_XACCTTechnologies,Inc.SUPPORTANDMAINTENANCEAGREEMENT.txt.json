                "original_text": "1.5      \"Product Maintenance\" means the Product updates and revisions that are          available from XACCT and selected by Licensee, as further referenced          herein and the attachments hereto as may be amended from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "1.5      \"Product Maintenance\" means updates to the Product. Specific details regarding updates are outlined in the Licensee's onboarding package.",
                "explanation": "The change removes the reference to 'revisions' and 'attachments hereto,' which would typically detail the specifics of product maintenance. Replacing it with a reference to an 'onboarding package' creates uncertainty because the onboarding package is not defined in the agreement itself, and may or may not exist or cover product maintenance adequately. This contradicts section 4 which outlines Product Maintenance, implying agreed definitions and levels which can't be adhered to if maintenance is based on an undefined onboarding package.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'according to the level of Support Services purchased by Licensee as set forth in Attachment 1 referenced in Section 2,' the contract now contradicts itself. Section 2 states Licensee may purchase Product Maintenance as outlined in Attachment 1, which determines the terms for major releases. Changing 4.2 to 'subject to separate negotiation' introduces uncertainty and the potential for additional costs, and now conflicts with sections 2 and Attachment 1 where the levels of service are purchased.",

If XACCT determines that a problem                   reported by Licensee is not due to an error in the Product,                   XACCT will so notify Licensee. XACCT may in its sole                   discretion charge additional fees for time and materials for                   the resolution of problems that are not attributable to an                   error in the Product or which are excluded from XACCT's                   support obligations as set forth below.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'and as provided in Attachment 1' is removed. This creates a contradiction because Section 3.1 mentions 'Initial response times for reported Incidents are as set forth in Attachment 1.' By removing the reference in 3.2(f) to Attachment 1 which includes problem reporting, it creates uncertainty around which problem reporting procedures are the ones that the licensee is expected to follow.",

Programmer will transmit, at its own cost, the WLIB Programs to the Station's transmitting facilities via a mode of transmission (e.g., satellite facilities, microwave facilities and/or telephone lines) that will ensure that the WLIB Programs meet technical and quality standards at least equal to those of the HD2 Channel's broadcasts prior to commencement of the Term.",

The occurrence of the following will be deemed an Event of Default by Licensee under this Agreement: (a) Licensee fails to observe or perform its obligations contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or (b) Licensee breaches the representations and warranties made by it under this Agreement in any material respect.\n\n11.3 Cure Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have occurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the Event of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured.\n\n11.4 Termination in the Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and in the absence of a timely cure pursuant to Section 11.3, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon written notice to the defaulting party.\n\n11.5 Cooperation Upon Termination.

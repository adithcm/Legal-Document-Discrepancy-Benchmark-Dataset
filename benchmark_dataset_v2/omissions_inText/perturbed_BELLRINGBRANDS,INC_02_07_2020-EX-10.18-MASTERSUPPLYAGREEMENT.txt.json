A Specification may be updated from time to time by PNC in its sole discretion, provided PNC provides Supplier with reasonable prior notice on any updates (\"Change Notification\"). Within [***] from receipt of the Change Notification, Supplier will either: (1) accept the Specification change at the current price and terms; or (2) submit to PNC a proposal (\"Proposal\") setting forth the conditions of acceptance that may include a change in price and/or other terms, including documentation to support same. Within [***] the Parties will discuss the Proposal in good faith and exercise their best efforts to agree on the appropriate adjustment if any. PNC will not issue any Purchase Orders, nor be required to issue any Purchase Orders to Supplier until PNC and Supplier have agreed on required Ingredient Specifications and any associated price and/or term adjustment. In the event the Parties fail to agree on required Ingredient Specifications or price and/or term adjustments despite their best good faith efforts, neither Party will have any further obligation with regard to purchase or supply of those Ingredients under any Master Purchase Commitments except that PNC shall take and pay for [***] of Ingredient inventory manufactured according to the then-current Specification.",

The agreement mentions indemnification against claims brought by 'Third Parties,' but without a clear definition of who constitutes a 'Third Party,' the scope of indemnification becomes uncertain. This omission can lead to disputes regarding which entities or individuals are covered under the indemnification clause, especially with regards to Affiliates, Subsidiaries, etc.",

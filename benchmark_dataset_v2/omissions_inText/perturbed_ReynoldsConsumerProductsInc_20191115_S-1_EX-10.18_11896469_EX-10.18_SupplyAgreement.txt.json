                "original_text": "The phrase \"Purchase Schedule\" will mean a written supplement to this Agreement signed by an officer of each Party which references this Agreement and which identities, among other terms and conditions, the specific types and quantities of products that will be purchased and sold by the Parties on terms and conditions in the schedule, the specifications for the identified products, the duration of the commitment period during which the Parties will be obligated to purchase and sell the identified products on the terms and conditions in the schedule, the prices of the identified products, any mechanisms for adjusting the prices of the identified products over the commitment period, and the facilities at which the identified products will be manufactured, stored and delivered by Seller.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit requirements for purchase schedules to include specifics regarding product types, quantities, specifications, duration of commitment, pricing, and manufacturing facilities, the definition becomes incomplete and conflicts with later sections that assume these details are included. This creates uncertainty in enforcement as the scope of a Purchase Schedule becomes ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "If a Buyer receives a product that fails to conform to these representations and warranties, the sole remedies of Buyer for the breach of warranty will be to: (1) reject and return the non-conforming product to Seller for a refund or credit, or a replacement conforming product, in the manner and time period provided in the SOP; (2) obtain reimbursement from Seller for actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in the recovery, return or disposal of a non-conforming product that is the subject of a mandatory product recall required under Applicable Laws or a voluntary withdrawal declared by Seller or approved by Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (3) obtain indemnification from Seller for any Indemnified Claim arising from or related to the non-conforming product as provided in Section 7.",

                "explanation": "By removing the buyer's ability to return non-conforming products and obtain reimbursements, the sole recourse is now indemnification. This creates a contradiction with any sections referencing product returns, refunds, credits, or replacements, as such remedies are no longer explicitly available. This introduces uncertainty in how warranty claims are handled.",

Commercial General Liability Insurance. Occurrence based coverage with a combined single limit of at least $10,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for premises and operations; products and completed operations; contractual liability coverage for indemnities of a Party contained within this Agreement; broad form property damage (including completed operations); explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and personal injury. Requires additional insured endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement. b. Automobile Liability Insurance. Occurrence based coverage with a combined single limit of at least $10,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate for owned, non-owned, and hired automotive equipment of the Party. Requires additional insured endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement. c. Workers' Compensation Liability Insurance. Occurrence based coverage providing benefits in the minimal amount required by Applicable Law for workplace and work related injuries and illnesses to the employees of a Party, including, without limitation, Workers Compensation Acts of applicable U.S. States, the U.S. Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers Compensation Act and the U.S. Jones Act. Requires alternate employer endorsement and waiver of subrogation endorsement. d. Employers' Liability Insurance.

Requires waiver of alternate employer endorsement. e. Property Insurance. Coverage providing \"all risk\" property insurance at the replacement value of the machinery, equipment, fixtures, tools, materials and other property of the Party. \"All risk\" coverage will include, by way of example and not limitation, loss or damage resulting from earthquakes, floods, wind, fire or other natural or weather-related phenomenon.

Later references to specific endorsements or minimum coverage limits lack context and create uncertainty, rendering enforcement of the insurance clause ambiguous. The nature and scope of insurance are now undefined, conflicting with implied expectations of comprehensive coverage.",

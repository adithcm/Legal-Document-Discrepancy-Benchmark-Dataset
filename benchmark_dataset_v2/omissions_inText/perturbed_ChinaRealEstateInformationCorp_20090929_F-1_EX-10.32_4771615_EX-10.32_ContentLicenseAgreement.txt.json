                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Competitor' is broad, encompassing any online portal. By changing it to only include real estate development businesses, it creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract discuss competitive actions related to online activities, as the definition no longer aligns with those sections.",

Licensee shall monitor and censor all Content on the websites associated with the Licensed Domain Names, including without limitation Content posted by end users.

Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority. Licensee's failure to comply with this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, Licensee acknowledges that Licensor shall have the right to remove such offending Content from the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names.",

                "explanation": "By removing the Licensor's right to monitor and censor the content, and removing the timeframe for content removal, and changing 'material breach' to 'may be deemed a breach', it creates a contradiction, weakening licensor's control.

Any Dispute which remains unresolved within sixty (60) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"Commission\") to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission's then effective rules (the \"Rules\") and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.",

                "explanation": "Removing the compulsory arbitration clause and replacing it with only friendly consultation will cause the whole legal enforcement become ambigious because once there is a dispute, there is no arbitration, this is contrast to the original intention.

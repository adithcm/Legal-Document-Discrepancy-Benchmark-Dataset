                "original_text": "\"Bandwidth\" means the measurement of samples of usage taken every five (5) minutes during a calendar month and collecting two (2) readings (cumulative of inbound feeds and cumulative of outbound feeds at the same measured point in time). The measurements are stored and become data points. At the end of the month, all data points taken during the month are ranked in ascending order. IBM will discard the top five percent (5%) for each set (inbound and outbound) of data points. The highest remaining sample of the two (2) sets becomes the Customer's Committed or Burstable usage number for that billing cycle.\n\"Burstable Bandwidth\" means the bandwidth consumption in excess of the Committed Bandwidth.\n\"Committed Bandwidth\" means the fixed circuit capacity that IBM will make available to Customer for connectivity to the Internet. Customer's data traffic between the e-business Hosting Center and the Internet may not exceed Committed Bandwidth, unless otherwise expressly specified in an Attachment.",

                "explanation": "The original text precisely defines how bandwidth is measured, including the sampling rate, data point collection, and the discarding of the top 5% of data points. The modified text removes all specifics of the bandwidth measurement. This omission creates uncertainty because thereâ€™s no clear method defined. It directly impacts section 4.6 of Attachment A regarding peak bandwidth usage calculation, since the baseline definition to measure it has been made ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By stating the remedy is in the attachment and removing the specifics, a contradiction occurs because the SLA mentions a remedy and the changed text refers to a different remedy that is undefined, leading to enforcement issues.

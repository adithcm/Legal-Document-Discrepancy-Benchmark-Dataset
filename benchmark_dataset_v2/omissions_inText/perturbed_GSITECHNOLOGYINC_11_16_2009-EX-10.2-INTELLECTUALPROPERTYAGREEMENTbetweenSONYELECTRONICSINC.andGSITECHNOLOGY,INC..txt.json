                "changed_text": "1.4 Licensed Patent(s)\nThe term \"Licensed Patent\" or \"Licensed Patents\" means any patent or patents issued at any time in any country. \"Licensed Patents\" shall exclude the Transferred Patents.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Licensed Patents\" contained specific criteria related to the invention date, ownership, royalty obligations, and infringement related to Competing Products. By removing these criteria, the modified definition becomes overly broad and conflicts with other sections that rely on a more precise definition. For example, Section 3.1, 'Grant by SONY,' licenses PURCHASER to make Competing Products under the Licensed Patents. Without the original criteria, it's unclear which patents are actually licensed, leading to potential disputes and enforcement uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the listed Transferred Patents are 'essential' to the business. Changing this to 'related to' significantly weakens the claim. This change introduces uncertainty because if the patents are not essential, the value of the assignment is diminished. Furthermore, it could contradict statements in the recitals about SONY's intellectual property being vital to the business, potentially opening SONY up to liability if the purchaser relied on the original representation.",

                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, on condition that it provides the other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment', the original clause now directly conflicts with standard business practice. A company involved in a merger/acquisition may not be able to gain consent from the other party, thus voiding the agreement. This could affect either party.",

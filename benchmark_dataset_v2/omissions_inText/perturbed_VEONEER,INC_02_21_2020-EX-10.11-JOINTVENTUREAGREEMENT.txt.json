                "explanation": "By removing 'all rights and obligations with respect to VNBJ under the JV Agreement shall terminate,' the modified text creates ambiguity. It's unclear if obligations tied to VNBJ still exist despite the agreement ceasing to have effect. Later clauses depend on the termination of rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the previous change, removing 'all rights and obligations with respect to VNBZ under the JV Agreement shall terminate' creates ambiguity regarding the status of obligations related to VNBZ. This directly contradicts subsequent clauses (such as Article 2) that refer back to the termination of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'that arise prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable', this clause now suggests parties remain liable for breaches *even after* the closing. Given the amended clauses 1.1 and 1.2 where obligations may not clearly terminate, it leads to ambiguity.  Is there a perpetual responsibility, even after obligations are intended to be cleared through the closing?",

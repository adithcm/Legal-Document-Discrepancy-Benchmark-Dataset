Later enforcement becomes unclear because there is no detailed payment schedule. If section 13 B) states that 'All orders from the Distributor to Lucid will be subject to Lucid's standard terms and conditions of sale.' Lucid standard payment terms are not clearly defined, it creates an in-text contradiction and the agreement is not clear. ",

                "explanation": "The original definitions of \"Agency Fees\" and \"Commission\" provide specific guidance about the fees and how they relate to the Manual. The changed text lacks the specificity regarding issuing a new policy (Agency Fees) and the cash payment aspect (Commission), and reversal/refund exclusions(Gross Revenues). This introduces uncertainty, because it is not clear the calculation or application method, thus creating an inconsistency and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "8.3.3 Your employees are encouraged to maintain a professional appearance.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to specific standards that the franchisor may require for professional attire and personal appearance, the change introduces ambiguity. The original text allows for strict, measurable standards, while the revised text only 'encourages' a professional appearance without defining what that means. If another section of the agreement refers to strict compliance with appearance guidelines (e.g., in the manual), this creates a contradiction.",

Such policy or policies must be written by an insurance company or companies we have approved, having at all times a rating of at least \"A-\" in the most recent Key Rating Guide published by the A.M. Best Company (or another rating that we reasonably designate if A.M. Best Company no longer publishes the Key Rating Guide) and licensed and admitted to do business in the state in which the Franchised Business is located, and must include, at a minimum (except that we may reasonably specify additional coverages and higher policy limits for all franchisees periodically in the Manual or otherwise in writing to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in the law or standards of liability, higher damage awards and other relevant changes in circumstances), the following:",

                "explanation": "By omitting the specifics of required insurance coverage (rating, licensing, specific policies), the change creates an internal contradiction. The contract still mentions the need for insurance, but it lacks clarity about what kind of insurance is needed. This creates a contradiction and uncertainty because there are no details specified and thus making the requirement unenforceable.",

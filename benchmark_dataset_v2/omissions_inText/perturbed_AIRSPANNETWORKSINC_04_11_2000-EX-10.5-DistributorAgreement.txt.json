                "explanation": "Removing 'comprehensive' and 'based upon the recommended list set forth in Schedule III to this Agreement' makes the distributor's inventory obligation vague. Section 3.6 now mandates an inventory but provides no guidance about quantity or types of parts.

                "explanation": "By removing 'as specified in Schedule IV' and sections d & e, price determination becomes unclear. The altered clause no longer explicitly covers warranty charges and delivery costs in the contract price. This omission contradicts subsequent clauses that assume warranty and delivery costs are included in the contract price, leading to potential disputes over invoicing and payment.",

Adverse Event shall mean an incident in which the Product was alleged to have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient or operator and would require submitting a Medical Devices Report to the FDA (as hereinafter defined) as per 21 CFR 803, or a similar report to a Competent Authority (as hereinafter defined) as per Vigilance Guidance MEDDEV 2.12-1.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to submit a Medical Devices Report to the FDA per 21 CFR 803, or a similar report to a Competent Authority as per Vigilance Guidance MEDDEV 2.12-1, while Section 12.5 still refers to reporting Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities, there is an ambiguity regarding the specific reporting procedure and standards to be followed. This omission creates an internal contradiction as the contract requires reporting adverse events but omits the mandatory standards, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definitions of “Qualigen Background IP” and “Sekisui Background IP,” while later sections still reference those terms, there is a lack of clarity about what specific intellectual property is included in background IP. This creates an inconsistency, because Section 8.2 refers to Sekisui Background IP without defining it. This will make it more difficult to decide what background IP is and will create disputes.",

Qualigen hereby represents, warrants and covenants that: (f) The manufacturing facilities and processes utilized for the manufacture of each Product shall comply with applicable FDA regulations including, without limitation, applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices as described in 21 CFR 820. Qualigen does not represent, warrant or covenant that the Development Plan will be successfully accomplished, that the Development Plan will produce any particular results or any favorable results, that the Development Plan will result in any Development IP (or in any valuable Development IP), that the Products (if any) arising from the Development Plan can ever receive Regulatory Approvals or be successfully or profitably commercialized, or that any other current or future Products can be successfully or profitably commercialized by Sekisui. Moreover, Sekisui acknowledges and accepts the risks inherent in attempting to develop and commercialize any medical product. There is no implied representation that any Products can be successfully developed or commercialized. Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui's customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui's customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the \"User Warranty\"). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress.",

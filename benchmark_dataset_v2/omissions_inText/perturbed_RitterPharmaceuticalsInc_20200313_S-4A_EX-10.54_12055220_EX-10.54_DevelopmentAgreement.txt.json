                "original_text": "1. Definitions 1.1. Adverse Event shall mean an incident in which the Product was alleged to have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient or operator and would require submitting a Medical Devices Report to the FDA (as hereinafter defined) as per 21 CFR 803, or a similar report to a Competent Authority (as hereinafter defined) as per Vigilance Guidance MEDDEV 2.12-1.",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions 1.1. Adverse Event shall mean any incident related to the Product. The procedure for reporting such events will be determined at a later date.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Adverse Event' to be any incident related to the product and stating that the reporting procedure will be determined later, we introduce ambiguity. The original definition tied 'Adverse Event' to specific reporting requirements (Medical Devices Report to the FDA, etc.), implying an established protocol. The new definition broadens the scope of what constitutes an adverse event but removes the clarity on how to report them, which could lead to a contradiction with Section 12.5. regarding Adverse Events, Recalls and Field Corrections. Furthermore, this new definition does not include a severity component, which could be considered contradictory, given that the original section specifies that it must 'require submitting a Medical Devices Report to the FDA'.",

In addition to the payments for the purchase of Products set forth in Section 4.1 above, in connection with this Agreement and in furtherance of the Development Plan, Sekisui shall provide to Qualigen up to $6,200,000 of financing in accordance with the timing and other provisions of the Development Plan and the achievement of the applicable milestones set forth therein (the \"Financing Payments\"). All such Financing Payments shall be used in accordance with the Development Plan and shall be non-refundable once paid, other than as set off in connection with a Sale Transaction as further described below. Time is of the essence for the payment by Sekisui of the resulting Financing Payments upon confirmation of achievement by Qualigen of the respective Development Plan milestones as set forth in Section 6.2 and the Development Plan.",

In addition to the payments for the purchase of Products set forth in Section 4.1 above, in connection with this Agreement and in furtherance of the Development Plan, Sekisui may provide financing to Qualigen (the \"Financing Payments\"). All such Financing Payments shall be used in general support of Qualigen's business operations.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the specific amount ($6,200,000), the link to the Development Plan milestones, and the non-refundable nature of the payments creates a contradiction. The original text ties the Financing Payments directly to the Development Plan and specific milestones, while the modified text states that payments 'may' be provided and are for 'general support' creating a direct conflict. Additionally, we lose the 'time is of the essence' clause.",

As part of Sekisui's supplier approval program, Sekisui will have the option to perform an audit (applying Sekisui's standard supplier criteria for qualification as an \"Approved Supplier\") at Qualigen's Carlsbad, California manufacturing facility annually and at each relocated manufacturing facility at which Qualigen will manufacture the Products within sixty (60) days of Qualigen's notice to Sekisui of the relocation of such manufacturing facility. Within thirty (30) days after the completion of an audit, Sekisui shall inform Qualigen in writing of the results of such audit. If Qualigen does not pass such audit and the reasons for such failure can be remedied within a reasonable period of time (which shall not be less than sixty (60) days), then Sekisui shall provide Qualigen with a list of proposed remedial action items and a proposed timeframe within which to accomplish such action items. If Qualigen does not pass such audit and the reasons for such failure cannot be remedied within a reasonable period of time or Qualigen fails or elects not to complete any remedial actions reasonably suggested by Sekisui, then Sekisui's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 of this Agreement, with such termination to be effective upon receipt of a termination notice by Qualigen sent by Sekisui at any time after the sixty day remedy period described in this Section 5.4 has passed. As scheduled, Sekisui may perform an audit during reasonable business hours to confirm ongoing compliance with the Quality System Regulations and confirm adequate process controls. Sekisui shall notify Qualigen at least one month in advance of a planned audit and Qualigen shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the desired schedule. Sekisui further agrees that any information obtained from Qualigen or its Affiliates or agents in connection with any such audit shall be deemed Qualigen Confidential Information and subject to the provisions of Section 13 of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By significantly shortening this section, we remove the pre-approved status of Qualigen, the detailed audit process, the remediation process, and Sekisui's sole remedy for failing an audit. This change creates uncertainty, as other sections reference the quality and regulatory compliance of Qualigen, and by removing the specifics around the audit process and consequences, the means of ensuring that compliance is no longer clearly defined, creating a contradiction about Qualigen's 'Approved Supplier' status.",

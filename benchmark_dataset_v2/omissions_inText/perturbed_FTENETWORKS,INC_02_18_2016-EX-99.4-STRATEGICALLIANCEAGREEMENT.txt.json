                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall be permitted to subcontract any part of the Work without the prior written notification and consent of EDGE. However, Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control. All Work performed by a Lower-tier Subcontractor shall be deemed Work performed by Subcontractor. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'Subcontractor will follow subcontracting requirements and processes of EDGE and provide joint access to subcontractor database and information concerning quality control. Subcontractor agrees not to hire any Lower-tier Subcontractor to whose employment EDGE reasonably objects,' the changed text creates uncertainty because the original text specifies requirements for subcontracting, but the edited version removes them, potentially conflicting with sections that assume these requirements are in place (e.g., quality control or insurance requirements for lower-tier subcontractors).",

Subcontractor shall be solely responsible for all construction means, methods, techniques, procedures and safety and security programs in connection with the performance of the Work.",
                "explanation": "By removing the sentence 'EDGE shall have the right to require repair or replacement of any Work which is defective or not performed in accordance with the Purchase Order or deviates from other requirements of this Agreement, provided Subcontractor shall have until acceptance to complete such repair or replacement', the contract still allows for inspection but removes EDGE's explicit right to demand rectification, making enforcement uncertain if EDGE discovers defective work. This omission contradicts the implied responsibility of the subcontractor to deliver work according to specifications, but lacks the power to enforce it.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'all taxes' to 'certain taxes', the modified text introduces ambiguity about which taxes are included in the fees and which are the responsibility of the subcontractor, creating a contradiction. This directly impacts the financial obligations of both parties and can lead to disputes about tax responsibilities. This contradicts a clear allocation of tax responsibilities.",

If the Work of any Lower-tier Subcontractor is unsatisfactory or unnecessarily delayed, or the Lower-tier Subcontractor violates any of the provisions of this Agreement, EDGE may request Subcontractor to terminate such Lower-tier Subcontractor and Subcontractor shall immediately terminate the agreement with its Lower-tier Subcontractors without any liability to EDGE whatsoever.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'pursuant to the Texas Arbitration Dispute Resolution Act, (Texas Practice and Remedies Code, Chapter 154), and in accordance with the construction industry rules then in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise' in section 26 and 'including the jurisdiction and venue in connection with Paragraph 26 : TEXAS ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT' creates a contradiction. Section 27 still references alternative dispute resolution (mediation or non-binding arbitration) while omitting the Act governing it, thereby creating an enforceability gap. This ambiguity allows for differing interpretations of the dispute resolution process.",

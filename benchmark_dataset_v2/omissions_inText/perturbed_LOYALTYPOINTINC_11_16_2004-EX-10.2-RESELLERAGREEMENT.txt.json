In any consecutive three (3) month period in which the difference between the Card Inventory Forecast less the actual Card Order volume for that period is a shortage of ten percent or greater (10%+), AEIS reserves the right to assess a penalty, (\"Card Inventory Penalty\") of sixteen and one-half cents ($0.165) per Card for such difference as detailed in Examples 1 and 2 below.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the amount of the card inventory penalty, the text creates an internal contradiction. The modified text still references a 'Card Inventory Penalty,' but the specific amount is undefined. This makes the contract difficult to enforce because the penalty cannot be calculated.",

Cards are usually shipped in packaging with AEIS' designated vendor as the return address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AEIS shall bear no risk of Loss and of non-receipt of Cards by the intended Cardholder in the event that AEIS is instructed to use another address as the return address, the address provided to AEIS for Schoolpop or the Client was incorrect, the request for the Card was unauthorized, and/or any information received by AEIS with regard to the processing of the Order was fraudulent or incorrect.",

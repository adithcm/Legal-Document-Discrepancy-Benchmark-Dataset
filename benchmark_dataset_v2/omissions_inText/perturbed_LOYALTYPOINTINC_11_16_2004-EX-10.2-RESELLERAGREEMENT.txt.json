                "explanation": "The removal of the NPO Marketplace definition removes a key restriction on Schoolpop's sales, but other sections still reference the NPO Marketplace. This creates an inconsistency. For example, Section 2a discusses Schoolpop's exclusive right to resell Cards in the NPO Marketplace. If the NPO Marketplace is not defined, Schoolpop's exclusivity becomes ambiguous. Also, this could contradict Section 4b stating Schoolpop will sell Cards only to Clients and only for use in connection with a bona fide fund raising program.",

Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to                   track information about its Clients which shall meet                   compliance requirements related to the above stated laws,                   track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain                   appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7)                   years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such                   records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request                   and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop shall further inform                   in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply                   with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards,                   including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School                   shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain                   records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to                   verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to                   maintain records of the information used to verify each                   Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least                   seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including                   name, home address, Card number, and other identifying                   information, and the name, title and phone number of the                   individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to                   provide such records and other information to AEIS upon                   reasonable request and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop                   and Schoolpop's Clients shall establish and maintain an                   anti-money laundering program with an assigned compliance                   officer and compliance program. Details of such shall be                   provided to AEIS upon request. Schoolpop and Schoolpop's                   Clients shall not accept cash, coin or currency in exchange                   for Cards.

AEIS reserves the right, at its sole                   discretion, to monitor and enforce Schoolpop's compliance with                   all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited                   to those contained in this Section 3 (n). Schoolpop shall                   monitor and use reasonable commercial efforts to enforce its                  Clients' compliance with all applicable laws and regulations                   including, but not limited to those contained in this Section                   3 (n). All agreements entered into between Schoolpop and its                   Clients shall contain a provision substantially similar to                   this Section 3 (n).",

                "explanation": "The detailed requirements for compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, currency control regulations, and client record-keeping are removed. This creates a contradiction because Section 4(n) mandates Schoolpop's and its Clients' compliance with anti-money laundering programs, the requirements for verifying identity of cardholders, and the maintenance of records of the information used to verify cardholder identity. By removing all these clauses and only leaving the part where Schoolpop shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws concerning the use of Cards, the contract is not clear on how Schoolpop can be compliant and therefore hard to enforce.",

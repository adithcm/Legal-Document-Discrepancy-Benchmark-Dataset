(i) A \"Regulated Substance\" as referenced in this Subsection is a generic term used to describe all materials that are regulated by the federal or any state or local government during transportation, handling and/or disposal. This includes, but is not limited to, materials that are regulated as (a) \"hazardous materials\" under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, (b) \"chemical hazards\" under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, (c) \"chemical substances or mixtures\" under the Toxic Substances Control Act, (d) \"pesticides\" under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and (e) \"hazardous wastes\" as defined or listed under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. (ii) Vendor shall comply with all applicable Laws, including any notice requirements, regarding any Material ordered hereunder which contains or consists of a Regulated Substance or any Service ordered hereunder which involves the handling, use, storage, recycling, disposal or transportation of Regulated Substances. Vendor shall notify AT&T and provide AT&T with all necessary information (including but not limited OSHA Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)) at least thirty (30) days before shipping Material containing or consisting of Regulated Substances to AT&T or commencing the performance of Services for AT&T involving the handling or use of Regulated Substances. Each MSDS must include information indicating the specific worker protection equipment requirement for use of the Regulated Substance covered thereby. (iii) AT&T and Vendor shall cooperate concerning the acceptance of any Material containing or consisting of a Regulated Substance or for Services involving the handling or use of Regulated Substances. Vendor shall provide assistance to AT&T of an advisory nature in the handling and use of Regulated Substances provided hereunder and the disposal of \"hazardous waste\", as defined by applicable Laws (\"Hazardous Wastes\"), resulting therefrom. (iv) Vendor shall provide AT&T with the same information pertaining to Regulated Substances in the Material and Services and used in the Services it provides to AT&T or Hazardous Waste resulting therefrom as Vendor provides to Vendor's employees or agents involved in the disposition or treatment of such Regulated Substances or Hazardous Waste.",

The remaining clauses 4.11 (a)(iii) and (iv) continue to reference and rely on the concept of 'Regulated Substance' and its compliance, but the vital original definition and obligation are omitted and this creates uncertainty in enforcement around the handling of hazardous materials.",

(ii) \"Provided Elements\" shall mean any Material, Services or Deliverables or other products, hardware, software, interfaces, systems, content, services, processes, methods, documents, materials, data or information, or any functionality therein, provided to any AT&T Indemnified Party by or on behalf of Vendor (including by any of Vendor's Subcontractors or distributors or any Vendor Person) pursuant to this Agreement (including under any addendum, order, statement of work, exhibit, schedule or other document under, subordinate to, or referencing this Agreement); provided, however, that Provided Elements shall not include any AT&T Provided Equipment.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the definition of \"Provided Elements\", the contract becomes internally inconsistent. Subsequent subsections of Section 3.17 refer to \"Provided Elements\" without defining what they are, creating ambiguity regarding the scope of Vendor's indemnification obligations for infringement. This makes it difficult to enforce the section, as the basis for determining what is covered by the infringement clause is undefined. Also, this could create some implications on 3.46 since any changes that would impact the subcons.",

(ii) Comply with the obligations of Subsection (a)(i)(1) above by a Background Check, including credit history, employment history, driving records and criminal history (\"Background Check\") of applicable records for those counties, states, and federal court districts in which a proposed Vendor Person has identified as having resided, worked, or attended school in the previous ten (10) years, unless a shorter period is required by any Laws.",

                "explanation": "By removing the requirement to perform a Drug Screen on Vendor Personnel (4.3(a)(i)(2)) and leaving the rest of the background check clause in place, the agreement now implies that all Vendor Personnel need background checks for felonies, misdemeanors, and sex offender status, but there's no explicit requirement for a drug screen for those with access to Customer Information, Systems, or Physical Entry. This creates an inconsistency because 4.3(a)(i)(1) mentions verifying information, which is expected, but the drug test is omitted for specific personnel. This omission results in ambiguity regarding the intended screening process, specifically for those with sensitive accesses, leading to difficulties in enforcing a consistent security protocol. If there is some personnel that would interact with Customer Information, Systems or Phisical entry but they not need the backgroung check this creates problems with 3.46 about subcons. ",

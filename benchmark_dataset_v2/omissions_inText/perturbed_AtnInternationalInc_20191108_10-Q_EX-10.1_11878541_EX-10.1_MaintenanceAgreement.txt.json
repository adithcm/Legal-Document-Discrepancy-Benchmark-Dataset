However, other clauses still reference 'Specifications' within the context of the Build and Maintenance Addendums, leading to inconsistencies. For instance, the obligation to provide 'Material and Services that strictly conform to the Specifications' is now undefined, since the primary sources of those specifications have been removed from the definition.",

Therefore, Vendor understands generally that AT&T's business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are firm subject to any Excusable Delay, time is of the essence, and, subject to any Excusable Delay, Vendor will complete such Delivery in strict conformance with the Specifications.\n\n(b) Vendor shall perform or cause to be performed testing sufficient to ensure that all of the Material and Deliverables perform in accordance with the Specifications, including all of the Cell Site optimization and testing contemplated by the Build Addendum. If testing indicates that any of the Cell Sites (or any of the Material or Deliverables relating thereto) does not conform to the Specifications, then Vendor shall notify AT&T, in writing, of such non- conformance promptly following Vendor's knowledge of such non- conformance. AT&T will advise Vendor whether Vendor should Deliver the non-conforming Cell Site or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto. In the event AT&T and Vendor agree in a signed writing to Deliver non-conforming Cell Sites or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto (\"Provisional Location Acceptance\"), Vendor shall use all commercially reasonable efforts promptly to cure any such non- conformance after Provisional Location Acceptance of\nthe non-conforming Cell Site; provided, however, that if Vendor has not cured all such non- conformance with respect to the Cell Site within nine (9) months following Provisional Location Acceptance (or sixty (60) days if the non-conformance is caused by the existence of a Lien, and in each case subject to an Excusable Delay), then AT&T may elect in its sole discretion, to complete any outstanding work, and recoup any costs by an offset against the Maintenance Fees due to Vendor for all Cell Sites. If such non-conforming Cell Site has not been cured within such nine (9) month cure period (or 60-day cure period in the case of a Lien), AT&T shall have no further obligation to pay any Maintenance Fees to Vendor with respect to such non-conforming Cell Site until the non-conformance has been cured. Provisional Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming Cell Site or receipt of any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto shall not constitute Location Acceptance and shall not constitute a waiver of any of AT&T's rights, warranties, or remedies under this Agreement or elsewhere, including Termination Remedies under the Build Addendum.

The details of the fee structure are outlined in that agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the explicit fee amount ($32,100) and referencing a separate side agreement, the contract now relies on an external document for a key term. If that side agreement does not exist or is not properly executed, it creates uncertainty in enforcement regarding the Sponsor's compensation. It creates an internal contradiction if Section 7, 'COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES' still refers to expenses related to the original understanding of the fee.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed requirements for the expert opinions and replacing them with vague statements about regulatory requirements and 'deemed necessary' legal opinions, the contract becomes much less specific. This introduces uncertainty about what constitutes compliance. If Section 6.2 (f), referencing conditions in Section 5, remains, it creates a contradiction: the Sponsor could terminate the agreement if the vague requirements are not 'satisfied,' but the vagueness makes it unclear what 'satisfaction' entails. It also contradicts section 3.1(e) about the prospectus if expert opinions are needed to validate its information.",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that representations and warranties survive for three years after distribution. The modified version removes this specific duration and states the representations and warranties will only be valid until closure. This introduces uncertainty and a contradiction if other sections of the agreement, like the indemnification clause (Section 8), implicitly assume a longer period for liability. For example, if a misrepresentation is discovered two years after distribution, it is unclear if the original indemnification still applies because the representations and warranties have ostensibly expired.",

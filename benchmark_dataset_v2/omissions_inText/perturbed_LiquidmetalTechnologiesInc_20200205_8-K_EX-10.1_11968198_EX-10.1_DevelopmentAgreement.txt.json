                "original_text": "2.7 Royalty. In consideration of the license of Liquidmetal Technical Information and the Licensed Equipment granted by Liquidmetal, Eutectix agrees to pay Liquidmetal a cash royalty based on a percentage of the invoice price of any Licensed Products (but not including Liquidmetal Products) sold by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix. The cash royalty shall be an amount equal to six percent (6.0%) of the Net Sales Price of the invoice price of any Licensed Products and for which payment was actually received by Eutectix (the \"Liquidmetal Royalty\"). \"Net Sales Price\" is defined as the gross invoice price actually received by Eutectix or its permitted sublicensees on the sale of Licensed Products, less returns or refunds, but before deduction of cash discounts. The Net Sales Price shall be commercially reasonable, and in no case shall the Net Sales Price be less than the cost of material consumed in a single manufacturing cycle, divided by the number of Licensed Products produced by such single cycle. The Liquidmetal Royalty shall be paid in U.S. dollars within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, based on payments received for sales of Licensed Products made during a given quarter. Liquidmetal hereby waives the payment of any Liquidmetal Royalty otherwise due and payable pursuant to this Agreement until the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date.",

                "explanation": "By removing the definition of how the 'cash royalty' is calculated, specifically the 6% of Net Sales Price, the contract now references a royalty payment without specifying how to calculate it. This will result in legal challenge as to how much to pay, also another section references this section for calculating reports. The enforceability becomes uncertain because the key calculation method has been removed, creating a contradiction. This is compounded by continuing to use the term 'Liquidmetal Royalty' without defining it beyond a general 'royalty'.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'subject to the Field of Use Restrictions (as defined below)', and removing the definition of \"Field\" and \"Field of Use Restrictions\", the license becomes much broader and potentially conflicts with other sections of the agreement that rely on these restrictions. The license now appears to grant rights without limitations that were intended elsewhere.  This creates an internal contradiction as the intent of restricted usage is undermined by the unlimited license grant.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"meeting or exceeding the minimum insurance requirements set forth on Schedule 2 attached hereto\" and replacing it with \"as determined by Liquidmetal\", the original contract references a fixed schedule, schedule 2. However, the modification removes the fixed, objective criteria for insurance requirements. This introduces ambiguity and uncertainty, and creates a contradiction, also Schedule 2 can no longer be referenced as it no longer applies.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detailed breakdown of 'other costs', including direct costs incurred by Terminal Parties and specific overheads, the definition of capital costs becomes ambiguous.

If full  payment  is not  received          within such  specific  period,  the billing Party or CBP may notify the          Managing  Group  of the  status  of the  matter  and  request  that the          Managing  Group  reclaim  the  capacity  in  TAT-14   assigned  to the          defaulting Party.\n\n21.2     The  Managing  Group shall have the option of  reclaiming  the capacity          assigned  to a Party that is in default  with any  payment  required by          this  Agreement  or is in default  with any other  material  obligation          under this  Agreement,  if such default has existed for a period of six          (6)  months.

Prior to          reclaiming  the capacity  the  Managing  Group will notify the Party in          writing that it is in default and of the intent to reclaim the capacity          after one (1) month.  The Managing Group shall  determine  arrangements          for disposition of any reclaimed capacity.  The remaining Parties shall          not be  obliged  to make any  payment  to a  defaulting  Party  for the          reclaimed capacity.  Except for the rights and obligations as specified          in Paragraphs 25 and 29 the rights and obligations under this Agreement          of a defaulting  Party shall  terminate at the time the Managing  Group          reclaims all of the capacity previously assigned to a defaulting Party.          This Agreement shall be appropriately amended to reflect the default of          a Party and the  reallocation  of  interests  pursuant to  arrangements          determined by the Managing Group.",

This Agreement shall be appropriately amended to reflect the default of a Party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific timelines and the action of 'reclamation of capacity' by the Managing Group, the section on default becomes toothless. While it still mentions notification and addressing the issue, the explicit right to reclaim capacity is removed, creating uncertainty about enforcement mechanisms. The process is no longer specifically defined, and no clear penalty is available. There's no specific process to reallocate interests if a party defaults.",

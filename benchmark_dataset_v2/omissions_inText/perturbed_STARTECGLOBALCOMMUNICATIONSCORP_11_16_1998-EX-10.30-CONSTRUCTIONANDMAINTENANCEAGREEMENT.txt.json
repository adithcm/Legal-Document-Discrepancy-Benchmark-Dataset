                "explanation": "By changing 'Ring-MlUs' to 'units', the definition of 'Allocated Capacity' becomes vague. Later sections that rely on the specific definition of Ring-MlUs for billing and capacity management will become unenforceable due to this lack of clarity. This change introduces ambiguity, as the type of 'units' is now undefined.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'all the detailed costs' in 18.3 and 'in accordance with Schedule B' in sections 18.4 and 18.5, it creates uncertainty regarding how and what is submitted by the Procurement Group and the capital and operational costs will be distributed, making the financial obligations of the parties ambiguous and contradicting Schedule B later on, also impacting 'Cable Station Right of Use' and potential disputes.",

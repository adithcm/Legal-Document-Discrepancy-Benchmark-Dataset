                "original_text": "(f) Export Controls. The Agent acknowledges and agrees that the products, materials, software, technology and/or information provided under this Agreement are subject to the import, export control, and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States, potentially including but not limited to any requirements arising under the laws and regulations administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\"), the Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\") administered by the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (\"BIS\"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\") administered by the U.S. State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\"DDTC\"), and the various economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). The Agent agrees to comply with any applicable laws and/or regulations mentioned in the immediately-preceding sentence. The Agent shall not, without proper U.S. government authorization, export, reexport, or transfer products, materials, software, technology and/or information, either directly or indirectly, to any Restricted Party. For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Restricted Party\" means any country or any resident or national of any country subject to a comprehensive U.S. trade embargo or other sanction (including but not limited to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and the Crimea Region of the Ukraine), any person or entity designated on the list of \"Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons,\" the \"Entity List,\" or the \"Denied Persons List.\"",
                "changed_text": "(f) Export Controls. The Agent acknowledges and agrees that the products, materials, software, technology and/or information provided under this Agreement are subject to the import, export control, and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States. The Agent agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws. The Agent shall, without proper authorization, export, reexport, or transfer products, materials, software, technology and/or information, either directly or indirectly, to any Restricted Party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific agency references (CBP, EAR, ITAR, DDTC, OFAC), the modified text still acknowledges the need to comply with export controls but lacks clarity on the specific regulations applicable. This creates ambiguity, especially if there are later sections that place specific responsibility on the Agent to understand these specific regulations. If another section mandates compliance with 'all US export control regulations', this omission causes a direct contradiction.",

The parties agree that Section 11.12(b) (but not Section 11.12(a)) of this Agreement shall apply to any dispute arising out of any such Commissionaire Agreements.",

The parties agree that Section 11.12(b) of this Agreement shall apply to any dispute arising out of any such Commissionaire Agreements.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'unless a contrary intent is expressly set forth in the Commissionaire Agreements, the terms of the Commissionaire Agreements shall in no way modify, amend, replace or supersede any terms of this Agreement' and also the reference to 'but not Section 11.12(a)', it creates ambiguity in the relationship of this agreement with the Commissionaire Agreements. If, in another section, this Agreement is claimed as the sole agreement and if there is no way that it should be superseded, then this creates a contradiction.",

                "original_text": "(a) Noncompetition Period. The \"Noncompetition Period\" shall be the term of this Agreement, and for the two- year period following the termination, cancellation or non-renewal of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event (i) Monsanto terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(2) or (ii) the Agent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(a), the Noncompetition Period shall be deemed to terminate simultaneously upon the effective date of the termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the conditional clause concerning early termination of the non-competition period, it contradicts scenarios where Monsanto terminates the agreement, as the Agent is bound by the original terms regardless of the termination type. This creates a clear contradiction, especially if other clauses rely on the non-competition period terminating early under certain conditions.",

Definitions\n\n1.1 The \"Equipment Rental Business\" or \"ERB\" has the meaning given to such term in the Distribution Agreement.\n\n1.2 \"Interim Period\" means a period of four (4) years commencing from the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\n1.3 \"Other Intellectual Property\" means any copyrights, trade dress, content, designs or other indicia and/or social media accounts and handles owned by THC and/or HSI that are already used or otherwise in the possession of HERC relating to the HERTZ and HERTZ-formative trademarks and logos in connection with the Equipment Rental Business.",

                "explanation": "By removing the original definition of ERB as referenced in the Distribution Agreement and replacing it with a cross-reference to Section 2.12 (which doesn't define ERB), an internal contradiction is created. The modified definition of 'Other Intellectual Property' also creates ambiguity. The original definition specified the type and relationship to HERTZ trademarks, providing clarity and limitation. Modifying to 'intellectual property currently known to HERC' is vague and creates uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific cooperation requirements and the reference to the Coexistence Agreement creates an inconsistency. The original text mandated cooperation and linked it to a specific agreement. The changed text replaces this with a vague 'best efforts' clause, contradicting the earlier, more defined commitment to cooperate as set forth elsewhere and previously incorporated in the now absent Coexistence Agreement. Additionally, the original agreement fully indicates and clarifies trademark use, which is not vague at all.",

HERC shall promptly notify HSI of the use of any mark by any third party which HERC considers might be an infringement or passing off of any HERTZ or HERTZ-formative intellectual property used by or licensed to HERC pursuant to the terms hereof or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement. However, HSI shall have the sole right to decide whether or not proceedings shall be brought against such third parties. In the event that HSI decides that action should be taken against such third parties, HSI may take such action either in its own name or, alternatively, HSI may authorize HERC to initiate such action in HERC's name. In any event, the Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary to prosecute such action, all expenses being borne by the Party bringing such action and all damages which may be recovered being solely for the account of that Party.\n\n5.2 Indemnification of HERC related to use of HERTZ trademark during the Interim Period. HSI shall defend, indemnify and hold HERC harmless against any and all claims, suits, actions or other proceedings whatsoever brought against HERC based on third-party claims of trademark infringement in connection with HERC'S use of the HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademarks, the HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks, the HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademarks and the Other Intellectual Property to the extent such claims, suits, actions or other proceedings are based upon use of the HERTZ element comprising a HSI (HERTZ) Foreign ERB Trademark, HSI (HERTZ) US ERB Trademark, HERC (HERTZ) US ERB Trademark or Other Intellectual Property during the Interim Period only and from claims of third parties against HERC or any of its affiliates stemming from HERTZ's use of the HERTZ trademarks.\n\n5.3 Indemnification of THC and HSI. Except as provided in Section 5.2, HERC shall defend, indemnify and hold THC, HSI, and their affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, agents, and employees harmless from and against all costs, expenses, taxes (including interest and penalties, and determined without regard to the tax attributes of any indemnitee) and losses (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) incurred from claims of third parties (including any taxing authority) against either THC, HSI or any of their affiliates stemming from any of the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement and HERC's use of the HERC trademarks, including without limitation any transfers of rights and actions which relate in any way to the manufacture, distribution, sale or performance or promotion of the Foreign and US Licensed Products and Services (as defined in the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement). This provision shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement.",

HERC shall indemnify and hold THC, HSI, and their affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, agents, and employees harmless from and against all costs, expenses, and losses incurred from claims of third parties against either THC, HSI or any of their affiliates stemming from HERC's use of trademarks. This provision shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Removing Sections 5.2 and significant portions of 5.1 creates a contradiction. Section 5.1 previously outlined a mandatory notification process and HSI's control over infringement proceedings. The modified version provides a vague attempt instead. Removing 5.2 removes HSI's indemnification obligation to HERC. The amended Section 5.3 focuses exclusively on HERC's indemnification responsibilities, omitting the detailed limitations and references to specific agreements, creating a discrepancy in the obligations of each party. By removing all details of claims stemming from HSI use from indemnification the section is contradictory because HSI has been indemnified for all instances, while HERC has a more vague description of indemnification.",

Holidays 12.1 The Executive shall be entitled to 28 days' paid holiday in each holiday year (which includes public holidays) to be taken at times convenient to the Company and authorised in advance. 12.2 The Company's holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December. If the Executive's employment commences or terminates part way through a holiday year, the Executive's entitlement during that holiday year shall be calculated on a pro rata basis rounded up to the nearest whole day. 12.3 The Executive shall have no entitlement to any payment in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday except on Termination. The amount of such payment in lieu shall be 1/260 of the Executive's salary for each untaken day of entitlement. 12.4 If on Termination the Executive has taken in excess of their accrued holiday entitlement, the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Executive by way of deduction from any payments due to the Executive or otherwise, one day's pay for each excess day calculated at 1/260 of the Executive's salary. 12.5 If either party has served notice to terminate the employment, the Company may require the Executive to take any accrued but unused holiday entitlement during the notice period. Any accrued but unused holiday entitlement shall be deemed to be taken during any period of Garden Leave.",

Annual Bonus 9.1 The Executive shall be entitled to participate in an annual bonus plan on such terms and with such individual, team or corporate targets as the Company may communicate from time to time which shall provide the Executive with an opportunity to be considered each year for a bonus equivalent to up to 50% of the Executive's basic salary. The Company shall be entitled to determine whether such targets have been met and where such targets have been met in full or part shall have a discretion to determine whether to make payments and, if so, in what amount and when. 9.2 The Company may suspend, alter or discontinue any bonus payment(s) or any bonus plan and its eligibility requirements at any time (whether generally or in relation to the Executive only) at its absolute discretion. If the Executive receives any bonus payment the Company is not obliged to make any further bonus payments and any bonus payment will not become part of the Executive's contractual remuneration or fixed salary. In order to be eligible to receive a bonus payment, the Executive must be in the Company's employment and not under notice, given or received on the date that the bonus is paid. Bonus entitlement does not accrue in the course of a year, and the Executive is not entitled to 5 payment of a bonus, or any pro rata portion of it, if the Executive leaves employment prior to the date that the bonus is paid. 9.3 The Executive shall not be eligible to be considered for any bonus nor shall any bonus be paid if the Executive is subject to any disciplinary action or investigation at the date any bonus is being considered and/or at the bonus payment date (as applicable) although the Company may reconsider the matter upon the conclusion of the disciplinary action or investigation in question.",

                "explanation": "By removing the detail that the bonus could be equivalent to up to 50% of the Executive's basic salary creates ambiguity. The Executive will be entitled to participate in the plan, however, a key part of the plan has been removed. This creates an in-text contradiction as the plan is referenced and therefore needs to include all details of the plan.",

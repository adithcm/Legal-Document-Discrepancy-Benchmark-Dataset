                "explanation": "Removing the details about the amount of holiday in a year and how a day is calculated, an in-text contradiction now exists. The main clause refers to paid holiday to be taken, but the details about how many days or about the amount of such payment is not detailed. This could lead to misunderstandings when calculating this ammount and could mean a potential breach.",

                "original_text": "Excite will deliver XXXXXXXXX impressions of the Client promotional placements described in this Section 1 during the first year of the term of this Agreement. Sixty (60) days prior to the end of the first year after the Launch Date, Excite and Client will negotiate in good faith to establish allocated number of impressions, advertising banners and promotional placements described in this Section 1 for the second year of the term of the Agreement. If the parties fail to reach agreement concerning performance details for the second year of the term, Client may cancel, effective on the later of the first anniversary of this Agreement or such time as Excite has delivered XXXXXXX clickthroughs, provided this latter date is not more than 16 months after the Launch Date.",
                "changed_text": "Excite will deliver a certain number of impressions of the Client promotional placements described in this Section 1 during the first year of the term of this Agreement. Sixty (60) days prior to the end of the first year after the Launch Date, Excite and Client will negotiate in good faith to establish allocated number of impressions, advertising banners and promotional placements described in this Section 1 for the second year of the term of the Agreement. If the parties fail to reach agreement concerning performance details for the second year of the term, Client may cancel, effective on the later of the first anniversary of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific impression target 'XXXXXXXXX' and the clickthrough clause (provided this latter date is not more than 16 months after the Launch Date), the modified text creates ambiguity about the actual number of impressions Excite must deliver and the clause that Excite has delivered XXXXXXX clickthroughs, which is a condition precedent to the agreement's continuation. This creates a contradiction because the contract references performance details but doesn't concretely define the initial performance threshold and the clickthroughs clause.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means an on-line department store comparable to Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Burdine's, Shopping.com, Chef's Catalog or iQVC.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"competitive retailer\" means retailers in the same industry.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'more prominently presented than any other 'competitive retailer's' banners or promotional placements' and modifying the definition of 'competitive retailer' to 'retailers in the same industry,' the modified text introduces vagueness. The original clause provided a clear benchmark (prominence relative to specific competitors), while the changed text replaces it with a general standard that is subject to interpretation. This lack of clarity contradicts the original intent of ensuring specific competitive advantages.",

Subsequent installments will be due on a monthly basis thereafter.",
                "explanation": "By redacting the specific monetary amounts 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' throughout the section, the modified text now references sponsorship and advertising fees and monthly installments without defining those values, creating a contradiction. The agreement states that fees will be paid in installments, but the total amount and installment amounts are undefined, making this clause impossible to enforce.",

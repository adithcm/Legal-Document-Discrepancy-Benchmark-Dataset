                "original_text": "As consideration for the benefits it receives under this Agreement, Torvec shall provide the following to Vendor:\n\nSee Exhibit A\n\nThe schedule set forth in Exhibit A will constitute invoicing for the events. Notwithstanding the above, Torvec may, in its sole  discretion, cancel its participation in any of the above-referenced events by notifying Vendor of such cancellation not later than two weeks  prior to the due date(s) for payment hereunder. All checks shall be made payabe to: Phoenix Performance, LLC and mailed to 481, Schuylkill  Rd, Phoenixville, Pa. 19460.",
                "changed_text": "As consideration for the benefits it receives under this Agreement, Torvec shall provide consideration as agreed upon in subsequent communications. Torvec may, in its sole  discretion, cancel its participation in any of the above-referenced events by notifying Vendor of such cancellation not later than two weeks  prior to the due date(s) for payment hereunder. All checks shall be made payabe to: Phoenix Performance, LLC and mailed to 481, Schuylkill  Rd, Phoenixville, Pa. 19460.",
                "explanation": "Removing the direct reference to Exhibit A, which outlines specific payments, while still referencing 'payments hereunder' creates ambiguity. The contract now vaguely refers to 'subsequent communications,' but provides no formal requirement for them. This contradicts any expectation of a fixed payment schedule, creating uncertainty about the financial obligations.",

                "original_text": "Vendor shall maintain insurance for not less than the following limits and coverage with duly licensed insurance companies having an A.M.  Best rating of A-, X or better. In addition to covering all of the normal operations of Vendor, this insurance shall cover all of the activities and  events described under this Agreement.\n\n  â€¢  General Liability: Vendor shall maintain commercial general liability (CGL) insurance with a limit of not less than $1 million each occurrence.  CGL coverages shall be written on ISO occurrence form CG 00 01 or a substitute form providing equivalent coverage and shall cover  liabilities arising from events, premises, operations, independent contractors, products-completed operations, personal injury and  advertising injury, and liability assumed under an insured contract. Subaru of America, Inc., its parent and subsidiaries shall be included as  additional insureds under the CGL using ISO additional insured endorsement CG 20 10 or a substitute providing equivalent coverage.",
                "changed_text": "Vendor shall maintain insurance to cover all activities and events described under this agreement. Vendor is responsible for ensuring adequate coverage.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific insurance limit ($1 million), the type of coverage (CGL), and the requirement for additional insureds (Subaru of America, Inc.), the modified text becomes vague. While the vendor is still required to maintain insurance, the lack of specific terms makes enforcement challenging and contradicts the original intent of clearly defined coverage. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes over the adequacy of the insurance.",

The driver for these events will be John Heinricy.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific details of Torvec's benefits (primary sponsorship rights, right to approve logos, sole right to disapprove drivers) and replacing them with vague terms like 'general sponsorship benefits' and 'input' weakens Torvec's entitlements. This creates an internal contradiction because the agreement initially promises defined rights but then provides broad, unenforceable statements. The contract references 'sponsorship benefits' without adequately defining their scope.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'any and all information that a Party may reasonably expect to remain confidential and not shared with the general public at any time or that information that is protected by law', the definition of Confidential Information becomes overly broad and subjective. This creates uncertainty because Section 2 refers to 'disclosure of Confidential Information'. The original definition provided specific context for what constitutes confidential information, while the changed definition leaves it entirely up to the disclosing party's discretion, potentially leading to disputes over what information is truly protected under the agreement.",

Subsection d of Section 3 mandates employees, subcontractors, etc., agree to 'return or destroy the Confidential Information as provided under paragraph g of this Section 3'. Because Section 3(g) no longer survives termination of the agreement according to the amended survival clause (7a), it is unclear whether the subcontractors, etc., are still required to adhere to the requirements as stated in subsection d after the termination of the agreement, since the specified procedure (formerly) outlined in 3(g) no longer exists.",

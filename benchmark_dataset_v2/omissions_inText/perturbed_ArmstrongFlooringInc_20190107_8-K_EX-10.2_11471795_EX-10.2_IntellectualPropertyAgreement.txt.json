                "explanation": "The removal of specific criteria like 'used or held for use exclusively in the Company Field' and 'as of the SPA Signing Date' from the definitions of 'Arizona Assigned IP' elements creates an internal contradiction. Later sections of the contract rely on these specific definitions to delineate the scope of assigned IP. By making the definitions broader, it introduces ambiguity and creates uncertainty in enforcement because there is no longer a defined period that limits the intellectual property to what was only being used at the time of sale.",

                "explanation": "By removing specific references and detailed descriptions, the definitions become vague. This creates a contradiction because later clauses rely on these detailed definitions to specify rights and obligations. This also introduces uncertainty since the interpretation of which assets are covered under 'Licensed IP,' 'Licensed Copyrights,' etc., becomes subjective and lacks clear boundaries which opens the door for misinterpretation.",

                "explanation": "Weakening the quality control clause in Section 6.3 introduces uncertainty. By removing the specific requirement that the quality be 'substantially the same as or greater than' and replacing it with 'reasonable quality', the standard becomes subjective. The standard is no longer clearly measurable, and the term 'reasonable' is ambiguous creating an internal contradiction. This creates potential for disputes and makes it difficult to enforce a consistent level of quality. It also makes later clauses about Arizona's oversight less meaningful because there is no defined way to measure quality.",

                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a particular technology involving titanium and specific materials. The modified definition is vague and general. Attachment A is still referenced elsewhere, and it shows the original defined technology. This omission creates a contradiction because the contract references a specific technology, yet the definition has been changed to a generic one. It creates uncertainty around whether Attachment A is applicable and enforceable.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree to jointly prepare and file with the applicable regulatory authorities this Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D and any future amendments thereto reporting each of the undersigned's ownership of securities of the issuer named herein, and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and hereby affirm that such Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D is being filed on behalf of each of the undersigned pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934', we omit the explicit affirmation of compliance with Rule 13d-1(k). Later sections of the agreement implicitly rely on this rule. This creates uncertainty, as the agreement's validity is now questionable without a clear statement of adherence to regulatory guidelines. If the contract references penalties related to failure of following rule 13d-1(k) elsewhere, this omission is even worse.",

The original clearly defines responsibility regarding the accuracy of information. The modified version implies all signatories are fully responsible for ensuring all information filed is completely accurate, even concerning others, leading to potential legal conflict regarding liability and creates a contradiction when read with the intent of the full document.",

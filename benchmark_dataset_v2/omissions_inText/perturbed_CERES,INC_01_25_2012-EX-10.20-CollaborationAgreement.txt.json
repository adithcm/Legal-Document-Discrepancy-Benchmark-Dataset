IGER shall have the non-exclusive right to exploit commercially RELEASED VARIETIES in the United Kingdom.",

                "explanation": "Removing the condition that a RELEASED VARIETY must be released for commercialization pursuant to a SCHEDULE creates uncertainty. Other sections might reference the commercialization process, but if the RELEASED VARIETY definition no longer explicitly connects to that process, enforcement becomes ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "By removing the CERES contribution threshold, the definition of Joint Intellectual Property becomes overly broad. Later clauses still refer to the contribution percentage when determining rights, creating a contradiction as to what constitutes joint IP in the absence of the contribution clause.",

Any commercialization (including, but not limited to, the grant of commercialization licenses) of JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS shall result in CERES paying IGER a reasonable remuneration (whether as a royalty or in some other form as the Parties may agree) to be negotiated in good faith. The terms for remuneration will be specified, with respect to specific RESEARCH PROJECTS, JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY and/or OTHER RESEARCH RESULTS, either in the respective SCHEDULES or in other agreements to be executed by the Parties.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the clause relating remuneration, IGER has no promise of payment with the exclusive right granted to CERES and the need to pay is not defined in the remaining text. This is a potential contradiction if there is mention of fair payment in another clause.",

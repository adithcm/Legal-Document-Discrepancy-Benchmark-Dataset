                "explanation": "By removing the specificity that the AETRU System includes 'Product as the refrigeration mechanism and the AuraGen as the power-supply,' subsequent references to AuraGen within the context of AETRU System sales become ambiguous. This omission creates uncertainty about which specific components are included or required in the AETRU system, contradicting other sections detailing responsibilities related to the AuraGen.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit C and stating the warranty is determined solely by Zanotti introduces ambiguity. Previously, a minimum 36-month warranty was stipulated. Now, this is undefined, creating uncertainty and potential conflict with other sections assuming a specific warranty. This is further compounded by stating that Aura is not responsible for warranty distribution, which could conflict with the previous statement that a 'copy of the End User Warranty shall be included as part of the packaging'.",

Aura agrees to indemnify Zanotti for direct damages resulting from Aura's gross negligence. The indemnifying party is only responsible if it receives notice of the claim within 30 days of its occurrence.",
                "explanation": "By significantly shortening and simplifying the indemnity clause, several contradictions and ambiguities are introduced. The original clause provided comprehensive coverage, including attorney's fees and various liabilities. The modified clause only covers direct damages from gross negligence, making it unclear what happens with other types of claims previously covered, like breach of contract or intellectual property infringement. Additionally, a very tight 30-day notice period is established, creating conflict with the survival clause stating that provisions of 8.17 will survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement. This implies that the indemnification obligation exists beyond the agreement term but is limited by the 30-day period creating a contradiction.",

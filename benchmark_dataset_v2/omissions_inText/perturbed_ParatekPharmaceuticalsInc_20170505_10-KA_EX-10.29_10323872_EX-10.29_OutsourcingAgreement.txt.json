By altering this definition to be more vague and replace specific elements such as Exhibit A or the specifics of the 'Quality Agreement' causes confusion about the exact requirements for product manufacturing.

Said written notice shall specify the effective date as [* * *] in which the Fee adjustment becomes effective and the amounts for the adjusted Fees.

                "explanation": "By removing all mentions of specific time periods related to fee changes, and removing the clause about 'any other cost adjustments mutually agreed to by the Parties via the Steering Committee' as well as the clause about record keeping makes the process of adjusting fees highly subjective and open to dispute. It creates an internal contradiction because there are other sections in the contract that refer to the 'Steering Committee' but fee adjustments and their oversight is not one of them.",

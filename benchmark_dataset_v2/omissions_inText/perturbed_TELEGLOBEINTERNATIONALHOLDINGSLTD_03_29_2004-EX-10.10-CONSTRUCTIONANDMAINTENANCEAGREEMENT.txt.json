                "explanation": "By omitting the first sentence of section 10.7, we remove the initial obligation of the Maintenance Authorities (MA) to restore interrupted APCN 2 facilities. The remaining text discusses the Management Committee's actions if the MA *fails* to restore services, which is contradictory because there's no explicit initial requirement stated. This creates uncertainty about the MA's primary duty regarding service restoration and what constitutes a 'failure'.",

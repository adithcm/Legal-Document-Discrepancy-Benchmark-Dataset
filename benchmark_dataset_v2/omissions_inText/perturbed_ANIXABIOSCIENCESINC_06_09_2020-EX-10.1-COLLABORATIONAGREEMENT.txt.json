                "explanation": "By changing the definition of Hit Compound and Hit Criteria, the contract becomes internally contradictory. Originally, Hit Criteria are defined by the 'Research Plan'. Now, the Hit Compound criteria is ambigious, while the Hit Criteria is defined as 'determined by Anixa'. This change creates uncertainty in determining which compounds should be designated as Hit Compounds, impacting payment milestones and intellectual property ownership.",

For each Lead Scaffold selected by Anixa, Anixa will pay OntoChem an annual fee of 10,000 U.S. Dollars, payable within thirty (30) days following each anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, until five (5) years after the first commercial sale of the first product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold, subject to Section 4.3 with respect to any Terminated Scaffold (as defined below).\n\n3.3 Milestone Payment. Anixa will pay OntoChem a one-time milestone payment of 300,000 U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days following the dosing of the first patient in the first human clinical trial for the first product incorporating a compound from a Lead Scaffold.",
                "changed_text": "3.2 Lead Scaffold Payments. For each Lead Scaffold selected by Anixa, Anixa will pay OntoChem an annual fee. The annual fee will be determined annually by Anixa, payable within a reasonable time following each anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, subject to Section 4.3 with respect to any Terminated Scaffold (as defined below).\n\n3.3 Milestone Payment. Anixa will pay OntoChem a one-time milestone payment upon a successful outcome.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific dollar amounts for the Lead Scaffold Payments and Milestone Payment, and replacing them with vague terms like 'an annual fee will be determined annually by Anixa' and 'upon a successful outcome', the contract creates a contradiction. Section 3.2 originally stated a specific payment of '10,000 U.S. Dollars,' but now implies a variable amount. Section 3.3 changes the trigger for payment from a clearly defined event (dosing of the first patient) to a subjective assessment of 'successful outcome.' These changes create ambiguity and potential disputes regarding payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "By changing section 6.2 and 6.3, the contract becomes internally contradictory. It removes the Anixa's assignment to OntoChem regarding Rejected Hit Compounds which are an important part of the original agreement. It also modifies the ownership of inventions and responsibilities of the parties. Specifically, it creates an inconsistency by stating that OntoChem controls the filing but Anixa controls the maintenance and enforcement. In the original section, the two parties would assign ownership rights to inventions of the other parties, while the modified agreement omitted this important assignment of rights.This separation creates uncertainty and potential disputes.",

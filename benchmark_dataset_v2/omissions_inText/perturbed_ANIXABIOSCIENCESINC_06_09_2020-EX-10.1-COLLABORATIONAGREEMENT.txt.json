                "explanation": "By removing the specific reference to the \"Hit Criteria\" being defined in the Research Plan, it becomes unclear where the exact criteria for a 'Hit Compound' are found. Later sections of the contract still reference selecting Hit Compounds and lead scaffolds based on these criteria, but without a precise definition, the process becomes ambiguous and unenforceable. This creates an internal contradiction because the selection process is referenced, but the criteria is vaguely defined.",

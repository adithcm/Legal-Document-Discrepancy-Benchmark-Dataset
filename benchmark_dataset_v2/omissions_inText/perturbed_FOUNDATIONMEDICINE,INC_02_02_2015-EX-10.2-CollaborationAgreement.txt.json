                "changed_text": "1.37 FTE Rate\n\nThe term \"FTE Rate\" shall mean an amount to be determined annually and mutually agreed upon by both parties. This rate will reflect fair market value for similar services.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provided a clear mechanism for calculating the FTE Rate, including reference to CPI and a maximum cap. The modified definition removes the CPI link and the cap, introducing ambiguity and potential for disputes. Later sections may reference the FTE rate expecting the original calculation method, creating a contradiction if the parties now negotiate a different rate without updating all references.",

FMI will provide Sample Profiling in accordance with the Reserved Capacity during the Profiling Term and Profiling Renewal Term, using the then-current versions of the tests included in its Genomic Analysis Platform. The Sampling Profiles shall be provided in a specified format to be mutually agreed by the Parties. The JMC will discuss and decide upon the Reserved Capacity commitment for Profiling Renewal Terms, provided that any Reserved Capacity amount in excess of […***…] that would require FMI to increase its existing capacity will require FMI approval.",

                "explanation": "This removes the clause stating Roche retains all licenses granted by FMI to Roche pertaining to intellectual property. If FMI terminates due to Roche's breach, the absence of this clause creates uncertainty around Roche's continued access to and use of IP generated up to the point of termination.

                "original_text": "\"Performance Benchmarks\" shall mean the following requirements necessary for Distributor to maintain the exclusivity granted in Section 2.1 hereof: (a) the execution of contracts to deploy Products in 25 new locations approved in advance by Hydraspin (\"Customer Locations\") during each 12 month period following the Effective Date and (b) all Customer Locations in the aggregate shall generate an average of 7,500 barrels of fluid per day on a trailing 12 month basis. Customer Locations must be available for installation within 90 days of approval by Hydraspin to be applied toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark. All Customer Locations in excess of 25 secured during an applicable 12 month period shall be credited toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark for the subsequent 12 month period. If this Agreement is extended beyond the Initial Term, as hereinafter defined, the number of Customer Locations to be secured to maintain exclusivity during the pendency of the Agreement shall be increased to 50 from 25.",

If this Agreement is extended beyond the Initial Term, as hereinafter defined, the number of Customer Locations to be secured to maintain exclusivity during the pendency of the Agreement shall be increased.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific numerical benchmarks for contract execution and fluid generation, the definition becomes vague. While the section still mentions 'requirements' and an 'increased' number of customer locations after the initial term, the absence of concrete metrics makes it difficult to objectively determine whether the Distributor is meeting the performance standards. Later clauses still refer to Performance Benchmarks, creating ambiguity about their enforceability.",

                "original_text": "\"Net Revenue\" means the gross revenue derived from the sale of the Hydrocarbons resulting from the Products, less (i) the share of gross revenue due to the Customers under the agreements between the Customers and the Distributor or any Affiliate of the Distributor, which is generally 50%, but may be greater or less than 50%, and (ii) ordinary and customary costs, expenses and fees that are deducted from the gross revenue.",
                "changed_text": "\"Net Revenue\" means the gross revenue derived from the sale of the Hydrocarbons resulting from the Products. Costs, expenses and fees may be deducted from the gross revenue.",
                "explanation": "By omitting the specifics of the revenue share due to customers, the calculation of Net Revenue becomes unclear. While stating costs *may* be deducted, it removes the *mandatory* deduction of the customer's share. This directly affects how the Distributor Share and Hydraspin Share are calculated and creates potential disputes as later sections rely on this definition.",

(b) Immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events and effective upon delivery of notice: (1) by Hydraspin, i f  Distributor ceases to  do business, or otherwise terminates Distributor's business operations; (2) by Distributor, if Hydraspin ceases to do business, or otherwise terminates Hydraspin's business operations; (3) by Hydraspin, if Distributor fails to satisfy the Performance Thresholds; (4) by either Party, if any representation by the other Party made in this Agreement was false or misleading in any material respect when made; (5) by Distributor, if Hydraspin fails to secure or renew any license, permit, authorization, or approval for the conduct of Hydraspin's business or the distribution of the Products or if any such license, permit, authorization, or approval is revoked or suspended provided that such failure, revocation or suspension results in Hydraspin's failure or inability to perform substantially all of its obligations hereunder; (6) by either Party, if the other Party engages in fraud, criminal/negligent conduct in connection with this Agreement or the business relationship of the parties or if the other Party makes any material false representations, reports, or claims in connection with this Agreement or any Product; (7) by either Party, if the other Party breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement and such violation is not cured to the satisfaction of the non-breaching party within thirty (30) days after written notice is given from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party; (8) by either Party, if Hydraspin undergoes a Change of Control; or (9) by either Party, if such other Party seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trustee, creditors arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such other Party.",

                "explanation": "Removing clauses (3), (4), (5) and (6) significantly limits the grounds for immediate termination. Specifically, removing (3) eliminates Hydraspin's ability to terminate for failure to meet Performance Benchmarks, which are defined in Section 1.1. Removing (4), (5) and (6) means that issues like false representations, failing to secure or renew licenses, and fraud are no longer immediately actionable. The result is Hydraspin still is required to meet Performance Benchmarks from Section 2.1, but has no recourse if the Distribution fails to meet the Benchmarks. The grounds for termination now conflict with other active sections.",

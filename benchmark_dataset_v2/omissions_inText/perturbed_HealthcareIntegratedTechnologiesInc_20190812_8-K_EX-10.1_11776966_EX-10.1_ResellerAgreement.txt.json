                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"MOQ\" means the minimum order quantity of Product units during the Initial Term, as set forth in Schedule 1. ***.",
                "changed_text": "\"MOQ\" means a suggested order quantity of Product units during the Initial Term. ***.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of MOQ creates a specific obligation. The changed definition makes it merely a 'suggested' quantity, undermining the enforceability of order requirements in Section 4.1 (Orders, Payment and Delivery), especially if Reseller fails to submit Orders with an aggregate value equal to or greater than the MOQ, then Reseller shall pay Supplier a sum equal to the shortfall.",
                "location": "Section 1.4"

            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Immediately upon delivery of the Products at the Reseller's facilities within the Territory (\"Arrival Date\"), Reseller shall visually inspect the Products and the appropriate documents, and employ good receiving/delivering procedures, verification of the Products to confirm origin, identity, quantity, labeled storage conditions, integrity of the packaging as well as any other inspection, as may be required by applicable laws or regulations.",
                "changed_text": "Immediately upon delivery of the Products at the Reseller's facilities within the Territory (\"Arrival Date\"), Reseller may inspect the Products.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates the Reseller to conduct detailed inspections upon delivery. By changing 'shall' to 'may,' the obligation to inspect becomes discretionary. This contradicts section 5.1 where if any Returns Discount Program is not in place, and the Supplier will not accept Returned Product, except for cases of Defective Products, which is a condition determined after proper inspection.",

            {
                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": " Reseller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Supplier and its employees, officers, directors, suppliers, and successors from and against any third-party claim, suit, proceeding, damages, losses and/or liability arising from or related to (i) Reseller's breach of any provision of this Agreement; and/or (ii) Reseller's interaction and/or relationship with any Customer and/or End User or other third party.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Supplier and its employees, officers, directors, suppliers, and successors from and against any third-party claim, suit, proceeding, damages, losses and/or liability arising from or related to (i) Reseller's gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "The original clause required the Reseller to indemnify the supplier from any third party claim, resulting from the breach of contract or from Reseller's relationship with the Customer. The changed text significantly narrows this to only 'Reseller's gross negligence,' removing indemnity coverage for other types of claims, e.g. resulting from Reseller's breach of contract, thus undercutting the scope and impact of this article. For example, Supplier will now be exposed to liability and risks of breach of contract, as stated in Section 12.2 'each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the other Party is in material breach of its obligations hereunder and fails to remedy such breach within 30 days after being requested in writing to do so'.",

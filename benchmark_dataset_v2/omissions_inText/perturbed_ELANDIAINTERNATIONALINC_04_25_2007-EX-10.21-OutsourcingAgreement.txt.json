                "explanation": "The definition of 'CPI' and 'Datec fails to comply with the Transition Plan' has been removed. Later sections referring to CPI adjustments and Transition Plan will be unclear because the calculation method for CPI is removed, leading to ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement. The reference is still available but now has no definition, causing a circular reference issue.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and the Service Level Agreement', it becomes unclear what specific reports are required to validate performance under the SLA. This creates a contradiction because the SLA is referenced elsewhere in the document (Schedule B) but not here, creating uncertainty about reporting obligations and how they relate to the SLA. Schedule B defines the SLA but this section 4.2 no longer recognizes the documents as required reporting.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to the 'Asset Register (Schedule A)' from section 17.1, it becomes unclear which assets are covered by the insurance. Schedule A provides detailed lists of covered equipment but without the explicit association, the scope of insurance coverage is ambiguous. This contradiction arises because Section 17.1 now implies all assets are covered, which contrasts with the more specific definition in Schedule A, causing potential disputes regarding asset coverage. Later sections still references Schedule A.",

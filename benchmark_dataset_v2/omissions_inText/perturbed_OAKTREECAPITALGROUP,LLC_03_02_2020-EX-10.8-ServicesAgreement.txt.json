FEES\n3.1 In consideration of the provision of services under this Agreement, Oaktree US will pay the Sub-Advisor such fees as may be agreed between the parties from time to time (the \"Service Fee\").\n3.2 At Oaktree US' discretion, the Service Fee shall be reduced by any management fees received directly by the Sub-Advisor for investment management services provided to any party pursuant to this Agreement. The Service Fee shall also be reduced by any amounts earned on cash and cash-equivalents held by the Sub-Advisor pursuant to this Agreement.\n3.3 The Service Fee shall be reviewed by Oaktree US and the Sub-Advisor once annually (or as the parties agree) for continued appropriateness and in particular, to account for any changes in the Sub-Advisor's business.",

The exact fee amount will be determined later. The Service Fee shall be reviewed by Oaktree US and the Sub-Advisor once annually (or as the parties agree) for continued appropriateness and in particular, to account for any changes in the Sub-Advisor's business.",
                "explanation": "Removing the definition of the Service Fee as \"such fees as may be agreed between the parties from time to time\" and any mention of the method of reduction of Service Fee creates ambiguity. While it mentions that the fees should be reviewed in 3.3 there is no clear indication as to what the base fee is.",

LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n7.1 In providing its services under this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor will discharge its duties in accordance with the same standard of care established for Oaktree US in the relevant Fund Agreements, and will be indemnified by each of the Funds as an agent of Oaktree US in accordance with such Fund Agreements. To the extent Oaktree US and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, assigns, representatives or agents (apart from the Sub-Advisor) (collectively, \"Oaktree US Indemnities\") suffer any liability, loss (including amounts paid in settlement), damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively \"Losses\") in connection with the Funds, and:-\n(a) Oaktree US Indemnities are not indemnified by the Funds for such Losses under the indemnification provisions of the applicable Fund Agreements;\n(b) such Losses were suffered by virtue of the Sub-Advisor's or its employees' acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions under this Agreement; and\n(c) the Sub-Advisor (including its employees) is guilty of negligence or wilful misconduct,\nthen the Sub-Advisor will hold Oaktree US Indemnities harmless and indemnify it for such Losses; provided that the Sub-Advisor shall not be liable for actions or omissions to act ordered by Oaktree US to which the Sub-Advisor objected in writing at the time of such order.\n7.2 The provisions of this Clause 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By omitting 'and will be indemnified by each of the Funds as an agent of Oaktree US in accordance with such Fund Agreements' and omitting condition (c), the text creates a contradiction. The original text clearly states the sub-advisor would be indemnified. By omitting this clause and the negligence condition, it creates ambiguity about the indemnity responsibility.",

Accordingly, in conformity with the FCA Rules, a number of additional statements and provisions are required to be included in this Agreement. Such additional statements and provisions are set out in Schedule 1 hereof (\"Additional FCA Provisions\"), which is hereby incorporated into and will form part of this Agreement and will apply to the services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement with effect from the Effective Date.\n9.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall require or entitle the Sub-Advisor to act as the alternative investment fund manager (as defined in the FCA Rules with effect from 22 July 2013) of any Fund or New Fund which is an alternative investment fund. The alternative investment fund manager of each Fund and New Fund which is an alternative investment fund shall be Oaktree US, unless otherwise agreed.",

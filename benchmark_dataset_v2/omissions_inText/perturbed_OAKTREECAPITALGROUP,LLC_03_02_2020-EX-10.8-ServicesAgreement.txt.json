                "original_text": "In consideration of the provision of services under this Agreement, Oaktree US will pay the Sub-Advisor such fees as may be agreed between the parties from time to time (the \"Service Fee\"). At Oaktree US' discretion, the Service Fee shall be reduced by any management fees received directly by the Sub-Advisor for investment management services provided to any party pursuant to this Agreement. The Service Fee shall also be reduced by any amounts earned on cash and cash-equivalents held by the Sub-Advisor pursuant to this Agreement. The Service Fee shall be reviewed by Oaktree US and the Sub-Advisor once annually (or as the parties agree) for continued appropriateness and in particular, to account for any changes in the Sub-Advisor's business.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the provision of services under this Agreement, Oaktree US will pay the Sub-Advisor such fees in accordance with Oaktree US standard compensation policies. Oaktree US retains sole discretion to modify compensation policies.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause defining how the service fee is determined, we have created ambiguity. The new text refers to 'Oaktree US standard compensation policies,' but these policies are not defined in this agreement, nor is there a requirement for transparency about them. The section that specified how the Service Fee would be reduced is omitted, contradicting any implicit expectation of a clear reduction scheme. This creates uncertainty in enforcement because there is no concrete agreement on the Service Fee calculation.",

                "original_text": "The Sub-Advisor shall maintain proper and complete records relating to the services to be provided under this Agreement for such period of time as may be required under Applicable Law, including (as applicable, in respect of the relevant Discretionary Funds) records with respect to the acquisition, holding and disposal of securities on behalf of the Funds, details of all brokers used and the aggregate dollar amount of brokerage commission paid in that regard to each broker. Except as expressly authorised in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law, regulation or court order, or as directed by Oaktree US in writing, the Sub-Advisor shall keep confidential the records and other information pertaining to Oaktree US and the Funds or the investment assets the subject of this Agreement (save for any records or information pertaining to the Sub-Advisor's own employees and affiliates, which shall be excluded from the obligations contained in this clause). Upon termination of this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall promptly, upon demand, return to Oaktree US all such records, except that the Sub-Advisor may retain copies for its records as may be required by Applicable Law, regulation or court order, and provided that the Sub-Advisor's confidentiality obligations shall continue in full force and effect with respect to such retained records not within the public domain.",

Except as expressly authorized in this Agreement or as directed by Oaktree US in writing, the Sub-Advisor shall keep confidential the records and other information pertaining to Oaktree US and the Funds or the investment assets the subject of this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall promptly, upon demand, return to Oaktree US all such records.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific clause detailing record-keeping requirements, including compliance with Applicable Law and the retention of confidentiality even after termination, we introduce inconsistency. The modified text is vague and does not clarify what record-keeping requirements exist. The exception allowing the Sub-Advisor to keep copies for legal reasons after termination is removed, creating a contradiction with other sections that may expect compliance with regulatory record-keeping.",

Accordingly, in conformity with the FCA Rules, a number of additional statements and provisions are required to be included in this Agreement. Such additional statements and provisions are set out in Schedule 1 hereof (\"Additional FCA Provisions\"), which is hereby incorporated into and will form part of this Agreement and will apply to the services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement with effect from the Effective Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall require or entitle the Sub-Advisor to act as the alternative investment fund manager (as defined in the FCA Rules with effect from 22 July 2013) of any Fund or New Fund which is an alternative investment fund. The alternative investment fund manager of each Fund and New Fund which is an alternative investment fund shall be Oaktree US, unless otherwise agreed.",

                "explanation": "By removing all mentions of the FCA Rules and omitting Schedule 1, but still referencing 'alternative investment fund manager,' a concept defined by the FCA Rules, an internal contradiction is created. The altered text implies compliance with rules no longer present, making its enforcement ambiguous. It creates a contradiction with sections referencing the necessity to act as the 'alternative investment fund manager'.",

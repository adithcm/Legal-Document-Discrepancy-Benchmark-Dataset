                "explanation": "The original clause restricted Content Provider from exploiting the content except for the benefit of the company; the modified version allows them to do so, thus nullifying any exclusive benefits the company thought it was getting. This directly contradicts the intent of granting an exclusive license to the Company. Section 1B still talks about sublicensing, and joint ventures with the Company. This contradiction creates uncertainty about exclusivity.",

                "original_text": "8. Conflicts of Interest, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation. Maimon agrees during the term of this Agreement not to accept work or enter into a contract or accept an obligation inconsistent or incompatible with Maimon's obligations under this Agreement or with the scope of services to be rendered for the Company. Maimon warrants that to the best of Maimon's knowledge, there is no other contract or duty on Maimon's part now in existence inconsistent with this Agreement. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company.",

Maimon agrees during the term of this Agreement not to accept work or enter into a contract or accept an obligation inconsistent or incompatible with Maimon's obligations under this Agreement or with the scope of services to be rendered for the Company. Maimon warrants that to the best of Maimon's knowledge, there is no other contract or duty on Maimon's part now in existence inconsistent with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By removing the non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, the agreement no longer explicitly prevents Maimon from competing with the Company or soliciting its clients and employees after the agreement's termination. This omission creates an internal contradiction if other sections of the agreement assume or rely on the existence of these restrictions, such as provisions regarding the use of Confidential Information after termination. This creates uncertainty regarding the scope of Maimon's obligations after the agreement ends.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered by Maimon hereunder and for Maimon's service as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will pay Maimon a monthly fee of $1,000 during the Minimum Period, beginning on the Effective Date.",

In consideration of the services to be rendered by Maimon hereunder and for Maimon's service as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will pay Maimon compensation, the terms of which will be outlined in a separate addendum.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific monthly fee of $1,000 and replacing it with a reference to a 'separate addendum,' but not actually including that addendum, creates an internal contradiction. The contract states there *will* be compensation, implying a defined amount, but omits any specific details. This makes enforcement impossible until the addendum is provided, if ever. Other sections may rely on a defined compensation structure.",

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "changed_text": "5. Termination. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time with reasonable notice.",
                "explanation": "By removing the initial clause detailing the Company's right to terminate if Maimon fails to perform his duties due to various reasons (including death or disability) and the specific 5-day notice period after the Minimum Period, and replacing it with 'reasonable notice', creates an inconsistency. Section 2 outlines Maimon's duties as CEO. Now, if Maimon demonstrably fails to perform those duties, it's unclear what constitutes 'reasonable' notice for termination, and it contradicts the original clear terms for termination related to performance, death, or disability. This introduces ambiguity and potential for dispute regarding the terms of termination.",

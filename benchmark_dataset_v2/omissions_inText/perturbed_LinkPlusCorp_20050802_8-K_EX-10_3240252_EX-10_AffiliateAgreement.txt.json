                "original_text": "Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout this Agreement, terms defined in the text of this Agreement shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit A which contains key definitions, the contract becomes ambiguous. Sections referring to terms defined in Exhibit A now lack clear meaning, creating uncertainty in enforcement. For example, terms like 'Axiometric', 'LKPL', 'AMR Product Suite', 'Gross Proceeds', 'Net Proceeds' are now undefined, impacting the proceeds distribution calculation as defined in section 3.3",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific percentages and the defined terms Gross Proceeds and Net Proceeds, the contract becomes ambiguous about the payment amounts. Section 3.3.3 previously relied on these definitions for the calculation of payments, but without them, it is unclear how much Axiometric is entitled to. This creates a contradiction as Section 3 continues to refer to payments based on proceeds without a clear calculation method.",

                "changed_text": "The RFM shall specify product requirements.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed requirements for the Request for Manufacture (RFM), the contract introduces vagueness. While LKPL still has the first right of refusal on RFMs, the omitted details create uncertainty. This means section 3.4 still references an RFM with less specific guidelines for LKPL to reject or accept the manufacturing request. This could lead to disputes over whether LKPL's refusal was justified, and how that impacts Axiometric's freedom to contract with an alternate manufacturer.",

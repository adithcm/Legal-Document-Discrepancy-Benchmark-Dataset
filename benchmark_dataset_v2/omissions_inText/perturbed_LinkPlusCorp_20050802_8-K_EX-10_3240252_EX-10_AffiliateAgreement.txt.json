If other                   terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then                   throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings                   respectively ascribed to them.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit A containing definitions, any term that only appears on that exhibit becomes ambiguous, even if used later in the main body of the contract. If a key term like 'Production Cost', is ONLY defined in Exhibit A, but is still referenced in section 3.3 for calculating payments, there is now no clear definition of how Production Cost is determined, leading to disputes. This also contradicts the definition of `Loss` in Exhibit A, since that definition is removed but still used in section 2.8.",

                "explanation": "The modification in section 3.3 removes the specific formulas for calculating payments related to Water Meter and Electric Meter AMR Product Suites sales to Datamatic, but it still references 'sales revenue' and 'profit-sharing'. Since the terms Gross Proceeds, Net Proceeds, and Production Cost are used in the original formulas but are potentially undefined (if Exhibit A is removed), this creates uncertainty. If the Exhibit A is available that defines gross and net proceeds then there is a conflict in how those terms will be applied, per the language of the contract.",

The definition of loss includes very specific things such as 'expenses (including all reasonable attorneys fees, costs and litigation expenses)'. The revised text doesn't define the scope of 'liability' and creates contradiction to the definition listed in exhibit A if exhibit A is included.",

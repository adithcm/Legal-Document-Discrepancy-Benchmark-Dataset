                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them.",
                "changed_text": "Throughout this Agreement, unless explicitly redefined in a specific section, terms, whether or not capitalized, shall have their common, everyday meaning. If other terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them, but only within that specific section.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to Exhibit A, which contains key definitions, and introducing ambiguity with 'common, everyday meaning,' while limiting defined terms to only the sections they appear in, the contract now has internal contradictions. Later sections rely on definitions in Exhibit A, but this section now suggests those definitions are irrelevant unless explicitly repeated, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the clear specifications of how to calculate the amount LKPL pays Axiometric, it removes the means of calculating the value of the payment. While the original text stated the amount shall be either a) five-percent (5%) of the Gross Proceeds or b) twenty-percent (25%) of the Net Proceeds, now the new text only states a percentage. This creates ambiguity for enforcement because calculating the amount is not possible, but other sections in the contract still reference the payments, creating ambiguity in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Payments not received after their due date may be subject to legal action as deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the definition of what constitutes a material breach (60 days late) and removes the guarantee of recovering reasonable legal fees. This weakens the enforcement mechanism for late payments, contradicting the intent of prompt payment outlined elsewhere. Without specifying a timeframe for a material breach or guaranteeing coverage of legal fees, it creates uncertainty in how the contract will be enforced regarding late payments, and what legal actions are deemed necessary.",

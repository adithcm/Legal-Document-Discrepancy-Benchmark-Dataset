                "original_text": "1.26 Maintenance Period - unless otherwise specified in a Product License Schedule, the Maintenance Period shall be twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) per week, including Bank of America holidays.",
                "changed_text": "1.26 Maintenance Period - unless otherwise specified in a Product License Schedule, the Maintenance Period will be determined based on Supplier's resource availability.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a clear 24/7 maintenance period. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by making the maintenance period dependent on 'Supplier's resource availability,' contradicting the original fixed schedule. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as Bank of America cannot guarantee continuous maintenance services.",

                "original_text": "1.19 Error - an instance of failure of Software to be Operative. An Error is a Class 1 Error if it renders the Software unusable for its intended purpose. An Error is a Class 2 Error if the Software is still usable for its intended purpose, but such use is seriously inconvenient and the value to Bank of America of the use of the Software is substantially reduced. All other Errors are Class 3 Errors.",
                "changed_text": "1.19 Error - an instance of failure of Software to be Operative. An Error will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines different classes of errors (Class 1, 2, and 3) and thus the appropriate action based on the error. The change omits the definitions and replaces the specific definitions and procedures with a vague statement about addressing errors on a 'case-by-case basis.' This contradicts the rest of the contract where specific sections still refer to Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 errors without these definitions, and thus the contract would be difficult to enforce.",

As a condition precedent to performance under this Agreement, Supplier agrees to satisfy the following validation requirements:\n\n A. Participation in Bank of America's Supplier testing and assessment process including the completion of online and/or on-siteassessment(s), as appropriate, and remediation of any findings;\n\n B. Periodic discussions between Bank of America personnel and Supplier Information Technology security personnel to reviewSupplier Security Controls; and\n\n  C. Delivery to Bank of America of network diagrams depicting Supplier perimeter controls and security policies and processes relevant to the protection of Confidential Information. Examples of these policies include, but are not limited to, access control, physical security, patch management. password standards, encryption standards, and change control.",

As a condition precedent to performance under this Agreement, Supplier agrees to participate in good faith efforts to determine security compliance.",
                "explanation": "The original paragraph lays out clearly defined steps to prove security compliance with Bank of America's standards. The new paragraph reduces the steps to 'good faith efforts,' which is far more ambiguous and therefore unenforceable. The removal of specific validation requirements, while the section header still discusses security compliance, creates an internal contradiction. The rest of section 27 details specific security measures and protocols, but without a way of determining validation, makes enforcement of the contract potentially impossible.",

The Board shall establish various authorizations and delegations for Management (as described below) to conduct the business of the Joint Venture as contemplated by Article 1.1 hereof.

                "explanation": "By removing the list of specific Board approvals (capital investments, dividends, mergers, etc.), and stating that approvals are not required, this change directly contradicts the original allocation of control and oversight. If subsequent sections refer to the Board's approval rights, they will be in direct conflict with this weakened statement. It creates uncertainty about the Board's power over key strategic decisions.",

The Support Services Agreements shall provide that the parties will provide the following services to the Joint Venture:\n\n11.1.1.Igene or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Sales and marketing services related to the world-wide sale and marketing of Astaxanthin in the Field of Agreement;\n\n(ii) Research services related to further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time; and\n\n(iii) Administration of the contract for manufacturing of Axtaxanthin with Fermic S.A. de Mexico pursuant to the terms of the Support Services Agreement.\n\n11.1.2.T&L or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Engineering and operations services;\n\n(ii) Technical and research services related to the further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time;\n\n(iii) Transportation and logistics services; and\n\n(iv) Finance and accounting services.",

                "explanation": "The original clause outlines specific services to be provided by each party, and refers to Support Service Agreements to formalize these obligations. By replacing this with a vague agreement to 'negotiate in good faith,' the changed clause creates an omission. If other sections of the agreement rely on the defined services being provided, or refer to the Support Service Agreements as being in effect, those sections will be contradicted by the absence of these agreements and clearly defined obligations. The level of support is no longer guaranteed.",

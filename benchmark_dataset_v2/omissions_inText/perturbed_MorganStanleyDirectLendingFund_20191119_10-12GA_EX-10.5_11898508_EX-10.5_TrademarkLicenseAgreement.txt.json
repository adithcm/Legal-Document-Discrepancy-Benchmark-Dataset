                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'immediately upon written notice for any reason, including if the usage of the Brand is not in compliance with the standards and policies,' the termination clause is weakened. Section 3.1 states 'Licensee's Permitted Activity shall be in a manner consistent with Licensor's high standards of and reputation for quality...' If Licensor wanted to terminate for quality control issues they are required to give thirty days notice. This creates a contradiction in enforceability.",

Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non- transferable, and (subject to Section 1.2 hereof) non-sublicensable license for the use of the Brand solely for the Permitted Activity. Section 1.2. Sublicensing. Licensee may sublicense its rights under Section 1.1 solely to a current or future wholly owned subsidiary of Licensee, and then only with the prior written consent of Licensor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that any such sublicense shall terminate automatically, with no need for written notice to the sublicensee, if (a) such entity ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Licensee, (b) this Agreement terminates for any reason or (c) such sublicensee materially breaches its sublicense in a manner that harms the Brand and does not cure the same within 15 days after notice from Licensor or Licensee. Licensee shall notify Licensor promptly after becoming aware that any sublicensee has breached its sublicense and shall ensure that all sublicenses provide (i) for the foregoing termination rights of Licensor and (ii) obligations for sublicensee with respect to the Brand that are consistent with those of Licensee herein. Any act or omission by a sublicensee that would breach this Agreement if committed by Licensee shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by Licensee.",

                "explanation": "By omitting section 1.2, the original text which states 'Any act or omission by a sublicensee that would breach this Agreement if committed by Licensee shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by Licensee' is contradictory. The change causes this to occur because there is no longer a provision for sublicensing, therefore the original statement referencing sublicenseeâ€™s breach of contract is contradictory.",

This introduces an inconsistency because, without this clause, Licensor's ability to seek injunctive relief for harm to the Brand is less explicitly stated, potentially weakening its remedies in Section 9.6 which states 'The parties' rights and remedies herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights and remedies provided by applicable Law.'",

                "original_text": "(h)  \"handling all voluntary recalls and market withdrawals of MOXATAG. In such a situation, DD will make available to  MBRK, upon request, all of DD's pertinent records on MOXATAG. Any and all reasonable and documented costs  and expenses incurred by DD in the conduct of any such recall or market withdrawal of MOXATAG shall be  reimbursed by MBRK, except to the extent such recall or market withdrawal was the direct result of the negligence  or failure of DD to comply with its obligations under this Agreement;",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause regarding reimbursement for recall costs creates an inconsistency. MBRK is still responsible for handling recalls, and DD must provide records, but it's unclear who bears the costs associated with DD's involvement in the recall. This creates uncertainty in enforcement if a recall occurs.",

Such prescriber activity will be the basis for DD to calculate the Promotion Fees due as per Section 5 for the applicable  Promotion Measurement Period.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific definition of 'Prescriber Data' as relating to 'USC Level 2 #15151 — Aminopenicillins category', the modified text creates ambiguity. Section 5 still refers to Prescriber Data for calculating Promotion Fees, but now there's no clear, defined source or category of data to be used, leading to potential disputes over the basis of fee calculation and uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The removal of 'all direct mail advertising will include an opt-out option for recipient prescribers' creates an in-text contradiction with Section 3.5, which requires DD to perform services in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Depending on jurisdiction, an opt-out option might be legally required for direct mail, making its omission a potential conflict that renders the enforcement of direct mail marketing activities uncertain.",

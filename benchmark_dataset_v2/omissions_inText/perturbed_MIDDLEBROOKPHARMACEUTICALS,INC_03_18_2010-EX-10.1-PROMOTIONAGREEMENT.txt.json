                "original_text": "DD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers and agrees to efficiently perform the services as described in EXHIBIT 4 in compliance with MBRK's policies and procedures, and all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback statutes, regulations contained in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) as they pertain to promotional activity of an FDA-approved pharmaceutical product and the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's (\"OIG\") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (2003). DD agrees that it shall not directly or indirectly offer, pay or transfer anything of value, in cash or in-kind, to induce DD Target Segment Prescribers to purchase, order, or recommend MOXATAG, nor shall DD exert undue influence on the medical decision-making of DD Target Segment Prescribers.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific mention of federal and state anti-kickback statutes, regulations contained in 21 CFR, and the OIG Compliance Program Guidance creates uncertainty. While the clause still mentions compliance with 'applicable federal and state regulations,' omitting the explicit references to anti-kickback laws can lead to ambiguous interpretation and enforcement, especially if MBRK later claims DD violated these specific laws. The other parts still allude to legality and guidelines.",

The Parties recognize that Promotion Fees are to be settled on a monthly basis which requires the use of an estimated Gross Margin Per Tablet amount until the actual Gross Margin Per Tablet for an applicable quarter can be determined. Accordingly, to facilitate the calculation and settlement of monthly Promotion Fees for periods after September 2010, the Parties agree that the Gross Margin Per Tablet used to settle the monthly Promotion Fees will be that as calculated using the previous calendar quarter's Gross Margin Per Tablet data and current period's Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx. Such Promotion Fees for the three months in any calendar quarter will be subject to a true-up process which will occur by the 15th of the second month of the following quarter. By way of example, Promotion Fees for each of the months of April, May and June will be settled using the Gross Margin Per Tablet amount that has been calculated for the quarter ended March 31 and will be subject to a true-up process to occur by August 15 with any adjustment to such Promotion Fees being settled between the parties within 15 days thereafter.",

                "explanation": "By removing the term 'fair market value,' 'Gross Margin Per Tablet' and 'true-up' the contract still states that payment is tied to services, but eliminates the clear standard. This could be used to claim payment is not tied to true performance metrics. ",

Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party reasonable attorney's fees, expenses and costs. In no event will the arbitrator have any right or power to award punitive or exemplary damages.",

                "explanation": "The original definition specifies that affiliates must be mutually agreed upon in writing. The modified definition removes this requirement, creating ambiguity and contradiction. Other sections referencing 'Affiliates' will now be unclear as to whether written agreement is needed, affecting obligations and rights involving those entities.",

                "changed_text": "Territory shall mean the world.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly excludes Spain, Italy, and Canada from the defined territory. The edited version omits this exclusion entirely. This causes a direct contradiction if other sections of the agreement rely on the initial, limited territory definition, especially concerning sales, marketing, or manufacturing rights.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may terminate this Agreement if it deems the relationship no longer beneficial.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific, objective criteria of failing to achieve target annual business levels outlined in Schedule 2, and replacing it with the subjective 'deems the relationship no longer beneficial,' there is a contradiction. Other sections that depend on the annual business level to determine obligations, for example payments, are now uncertain.",

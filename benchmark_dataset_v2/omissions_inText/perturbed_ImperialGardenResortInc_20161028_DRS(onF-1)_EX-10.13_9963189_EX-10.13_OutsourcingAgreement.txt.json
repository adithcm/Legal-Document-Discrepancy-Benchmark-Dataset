Service Fee The fees for services mentioned in Part I to Part VI are NTD 12 million ((SAY TWELVE MILLION ONLY) in total and the fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be calculated based on the ratio of 3.50% of the legal construction cost hereof. Should Party A require a comprehensive modification on the development plan of the project outsourced and any subsequent extra cost occur in Party B; Party A shall bear the corresponding extra service fee.",

Should Party A require a comprehensive modification on the development plan of the project outsourced and any subsequent extra cost occur in Party B; Party A shall bear the corresponding extra service fee.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause stating how fees for planning and design of buildings/construction monitoring are calculated (3.50% of legal construction cost), the contract becomes ambiguous. Later stages (Stage 8, 9, 10) of the 'Payment Method' section (Article V) refer to percentages of 'legal construction cost' being due, but now there is no explicitly defined method for calculating the planning and design fees based on that cost. This creates an internal contradiction and uncertainty in enforcement regarding the amount owed in those later stages.",

Stage 9: The service fee that is 0.5% of the legal construction cost shall be paid upon submitting the construction starting application to the competent authority. Stage 10: The final service fee shall be paid in a lump sum upon the completion of the structure of relevant buildings and submitting the usage license application to the competent authority.",

Stage 10: The final service fee shall be paid in a lump sum upon the completion of the structure of relevant buildings and submitting the usage license application to the competent authority.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specified percentages (3.00% and 0.5%) related to the 'legal construction cost' for service fee payments in Stages 8 and 9 introduces ambiguity. This is contradictory because Article IV does not give any further explanation on how the service fee will be calculated during those phases. This removal directly leads to an in-text contradiction, as the reference to a specific calculation method is removed while still requiring a service fee payment, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'all' to 'some' in Article IX, the duties of party B are now uncertain and unenforceable. This contradicts the general assumption that party B is committed to completely fulfilling their duties.",

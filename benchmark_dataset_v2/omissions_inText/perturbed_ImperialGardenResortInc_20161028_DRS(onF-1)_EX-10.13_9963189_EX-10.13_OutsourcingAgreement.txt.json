                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'and the fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be calculated based on the ratio of 3.50% of the legal construction cost hereof,' the contract now lacks a clear definition of how those specific fees will be calculated. This creates uncertainty and a potential dispute point, as Article V discusses payment based on percentages of 'legal construction cost' without defining the basis of 3.50% for the planning and design of building and construction monitoring, creating contradiction.",

                "explanation": "By removing the two sentences 'In case the Contract cannot be performed due to any reason other than the architect herein, the client agrees the fees paid will not be refunded. In case the Contract cannot be performed due to the architect herein, the architect shall refund the fees paid in full without taking any interest to the client.', the contract no longer specifies the conditions under which fees are refunded or not refunded in the event of non-performance. Without this clause, it creates ambiguity as to whether Party A is entitled to a refund if the contract is terminated for reasons other than the architect's fault, or if Party B is liable to refund the fees without interest. This omission directly contradicts any implied understanding or potential legal interpretation that fees may or may not be refundable, introducing a significant point of contention.",

The Consultant will be entitled to participate in any bonus plan or incentive compensation plans (including, without limitation, equity or option plans) for consultants or outside service-providers adopted by the Company. The Consultant's bonus payment level will be set at a minimum of 25% of the annual gross Base Consulting Fee. It is agreed that any such plans will be retroactive to the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 Incentive Plans. The Consultant may be considered for participation in bonus plans, if any, established by the Company. Any such consideration is at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.",
                "explanation": "The original text guarantees the Consultant's participation in incentive plans and sets a minimum bonus level linked to the Base Consulting Fee. The modified text makes participation discretionary and removes the specific bonus calculation method. This creates an internal contradiction because while the original implied guarantee may be referenced in other clauses concerning compensation, this new clause undermines that guarantee making enforcement uncertain. This contradicts the spirit of the original agreement to provide an incentive.",

The Company may terminate the Consultant's engagement for Cause. (ii) Without Cause. The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time by giving Consultant 60 days prior written Notice of the termination. In such case, 100% of the Consultant's unvested stock and, if applicable, option or warrant compensation of any nature will vest without any further action required on the part of the Consultant or the Company and the Company will deliver to the order of the Consultant promptly upon receipt of a written demand of the Consultant such shares of common stock or options at its sole expense as become due to Consultant hereunder. The Consultant's right to receive compensation whether in cash or securities shall survive any termination of this Agreement Without Cause. (b) Termination by the Consultant (i) For Good Reason. The Consultant may terminate the Consultant's engagement with the Company for Good Reason. (ii) Without Good Reason. The Consultant may voluntarily terminate the Consultant's engagement with the Company at any time by giving the Company 120 days prior written Notice of the termination.",

The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time. (b) Termination by the Consultant. The Consultant may terminate the Consultant's engagement with the Company at any time.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'For Cause', 'Without Cause', 'For Good Reason', and 'Without Good Reason' clauses and associated notice periods, the modified text creates a contradiction. Other sections may still reference specific conditions or consequences related to these termination types (e.g., vesting of stock options upon termination without cause), but those conditions now lack the necessary context. The contract lacks definition of appropriate remuneration upon early termination and will likely face legal challenges.",

To be provided under separate cover within three days after the date hereof; in the event that Consultant does not receive notice of address within such period, then Consultant shall be entitled to send any notice to any email address of the Company known to Consultant and the sending of any such notice shall constitute receipt of notice whether the Company receives such notice or not. (b) and in the case of the Consultant, to the Consultant's last residence address known to the Company or aitan@gcanrx.com.",

                "explanation": "The original text details specific methods for delivering official notices (personal delivery, facsimile) and provides specific addresses, while requiring any changes to addresses to be communicated. The modified version states only that notices must be in writing, removing the approved delivery methods and the addresses. This creates an inconsistency because other clauses may require 'written notice delivered to the address on file', but there's no longer a guaranteed way to ensure the proper delivery for it as the other sections of the contract assume the consultant has a valid, deliverable address.",

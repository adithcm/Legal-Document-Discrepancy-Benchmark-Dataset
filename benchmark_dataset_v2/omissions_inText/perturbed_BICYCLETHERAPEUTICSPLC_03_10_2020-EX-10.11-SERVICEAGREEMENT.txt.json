In addition, subject to (i) your (or your authorised representative or estate signing, if the termination is due to your death) signing a settlement agreement and a separation agreement and release (together the \"Settlement Agreements\") in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company, which shall include, without limitation, a general release of claims against the Company and all related persons and entities, a reaffirmation of all of your continuing obligations to the Company, including those set forth in paragraphs 13 - 15, and (in the case of the separation agreement and release) and a seven (7) business day revocation period; and (ii) the separation agreement and release becoming irrevocable, all within 60 days after the Termination Date (or such shorter period as set forth in the Settlement Agreements), the Company shall: (A) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to nine (9) months of your salary as of the Termination Date (which payment shall not be reduced by either the value of any salary paid to you during your notice period or by any payment in lieu of notice made pursuant to paragraph 11.2); and (B) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing you with the contractual benefits under paragraph 5 for nine (9) months or, at the Company's option, continue to provide you with such benefits for nine (9) months.",

                "explanation": "By changing the severance to 'at the discretion of the board' directly contradicts the original agreed amount of severance. This makes enforcement uncertain, as the original contract specifies a fixed severance. Also, contractual benefits are referenced, but the method of payment is now ambiguous.",

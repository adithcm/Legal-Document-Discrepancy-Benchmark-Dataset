                "explanation": "By removing clause (i) which states, 'any orders that are not timely transmitted by Administrator in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement or any trades that are cancelled by the Trust or its designee based upon payments for purchases of Shares that are not timely wired' contradicts Section 4 of the agreement which dictates how purchases and redemptions are handled and what is considered timely. The omission blurs the lines of liability and weakens the agreement overall since it indemnifies the Trust.",

Such fee shall apply to shares purchased both prior to and subsequent to the date of termination. This Agreement, or any provision thereof, shall survive the termination to the extent necessary for each party to perform its obligations with respect to shares for which a fee continues to be due subsequent to such termination.",

Such fee shall apply to shares purchased both prior to and subsequent to the date of termination. This Agreement, or any provision thereof, shall survive the termination to the extent necessary for each party to perform its obligations with respect to shares for which a fee continues to be due subsequent to such termination.",
                "explanation": "By removing the clause 'the fee in effect as of the date of termination' and replacing it with 'a mutually agreed upon fee' creates an omission that introduces an in-text contradiction. The original contract sets a defined fee based on the termination date, while the modified text creates ambiguity about the fee structure after the date of termination.",

                "explanation": "The modified text omits 'including provisions for necessary currency transaction reporting, detection of suspicious activities that could give rise to money laundering, and knowing Administrator's customers.' While it still mandates an anti-money laundering program, removing specific requirements contradicts the general compliance statement, creating uncertainty about the level of compliance required.",

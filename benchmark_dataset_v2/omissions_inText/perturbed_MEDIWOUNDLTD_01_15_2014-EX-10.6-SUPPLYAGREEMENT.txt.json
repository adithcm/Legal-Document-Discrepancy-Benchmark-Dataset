                "original_text": "1.13 \"Specifications\" means the specifications for Bromelain SP set forth as Exhibit 1.13 hereto, as the same may be amended with the consent of both parties hereto, it being agreed that no amendment may be made thereto or refused which would render Product incapable of application on humans or the use, supply or sale thereof in breach of any regulations.",
                "changed_text": "1.13 \"Specifications\" means guidelines for Bromelain SP quality. These guidelines are subject to change based on internal quality control assessments by CBC.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines 'Specifications' as those set forth in Exhibit 1.13, which requires mutual agreement for any amendments. The modified text removes this requirement, granting CBC unilateral control over changes and creating a contradiction. Section 5.2 refers to Specifications implying MediWound's prior approval, now contradicted by this new definition.",

                "original_text": "5.2 All manufacturing, packaging and labeling activities done at CBC will be performed according to the pre-approved batch records. If CBC wishes to make changes to the Specifications, the production and/or packaging batch records, the SOPs related to the Bromelain SP, or the design of the manufacturing process or any other change during production which would effect the quality of the Bromelain SP or of the Product and/or otherwise would effect the Bromelain SP in any way or which might effect the regulatory approvals of the Product, then CBC shall (i) notify MediWound in writing at least 6 months in advance regarding such proposed changes, and (ii) represent that such change will not adversely effect the quality of the Bromelain SP or of the Product in any way, and (iii) not make such changes without MediWound's prior written approval, and (iv) will assure that such change will not delay or in any way effect any open orders for Bromelain SP.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 All manufacturing, packaging and labeling activities done at CBC will be performed according to CBC's standard operating procedures. CBC may make changes to the production and/or packaging batch records, the SOPs related to the Bromelain SP, or the design of the manufacturing process.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for pre-approved batch records and the need for MediWound's approval for changes. This directly contradicts the original agreement, where MediWound had approval rights over changes affecting product quality. Now, CBC has unilateral control, creating uncertainty and making enforcement ambiguous since previously agreed-upon protocols can be altered without consent.",

                "original_text": "6.4 Prior to delivery of each batch of Bromelain SP, CBC shall submit a batch sample to MediWound for inspection and approval. MediWound shall have the right, for a period of [***] days following receipt, to reject any Bromelain SP sample which:\n\n6.4.1 fails to comply with MediWound's purchase order; or\n\n6.4.2 fails to comply with the sample incoming inspection Specifications.\n\nWithin the said [***] days, MediWound shall notify CBC of either: (i) its approval and acceptance of such batch sample (\"Acceptance Sample Notice\"); or (ii) its rejection of the batch sample in which case MediWound shall detail the reason(s) for the rejection of any such Bromelain SP sample. In the event of rejection by MediWound, CBC shall deliver complying Bromelain SP sample to MediWound within [***] days of rejection, free of cost (including transportation, duty, handling and insurance costs). For clarification purposes, MediWound's Acceptance Sample Notice in accordance with this section above shall in no event derogate from CBC's responsibilities hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "6.4 Prior to delivery of each batch of Bromelain SP, CBC shall submit a batch sample to MediWound. MediWound shall provide feedback on the sample. CBC will consider the feedback when finalizing the batch.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides MediWound with clear rights to inspect and approve samples, including the right to reject non-compliant samples. The modified version removes the right to reject and the specific criteria for rejection (purchase order compliance, specifications). The ambiguity of 'provide feedback' and 'consider the feedback' nullifies MediWound's approval power. Other sections reference 'Acceptance Sample Notice', which now has no defined meaning, creating internal contradiction.",

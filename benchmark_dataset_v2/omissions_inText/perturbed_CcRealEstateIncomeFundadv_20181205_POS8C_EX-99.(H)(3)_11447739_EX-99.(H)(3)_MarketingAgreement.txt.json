Documentation (which shall include electronic correspondence) not defined as \"marketing pieces,\" which shall include, but is not limited to, correspondence and materials provided directly in response to due diligence requests, shall be principally reviewed and approved by S2K. (ii) Distributor's services are based on the understanding that S2K will utilize current systems and expertise owned by Distributor, specifically the AdLit Advertising Review System (\"AdLit\"), and that Distributor will base its reviews on: (i) the guidelines contained within Distributor's Sales and Advertising Guide and Distributor's Written Supervisory Procedures; (ii) rules and guidance issued by FINRA and the SEC related to communications with the public and/or communications to institutional investors, as those terms are defined in FINRA Rules 2210 and 2211 and in various other FINRA and SEC rules and interpretive material; and (iii) Distributor's submission guidelines with respect to the use of trademarked and/or copyright materials, to the extent applicable. All material submitted to Distributor will be provided by Distributor to S2K with comments or approval no later than three business days after receipt in AdLit.",

                "explanation": "By removing the references to 'AdLit Advertising Review System', 'Distributor's Sales and Advertising Guide', 'Distributor's Written Supervisory Procedures', 'FINRA Rules 2210 and 2211' and 'SEC rules and interpretive material', the contract creates ambiguity regarding the standards and processes governing advertising and sales literature review. While the Distributor is still responsible for reviewing marketing pieces, the explicit guidance and framework for that review have been eliminated, potentially contradicting S2K's obligations elsewhere to comply with FINRA and SEC regulations.",

                "explanation": "Removing the text '(including additional fees for expedited reviews as set forth in Section 2(b) herein)' creates an inconsistency. Section 2(b) outlines the process and fees for expedited reviews. However, with this omission, while expedited reviews are referenced in Section 2(b), there is no longer an explicit obligation for S2K to reimburse the Distributor for the additional fees associated with them. This creates uncertainty as to whether S2K is still responsible for covering these specific expedited review costs, even if they request an expedited review.",

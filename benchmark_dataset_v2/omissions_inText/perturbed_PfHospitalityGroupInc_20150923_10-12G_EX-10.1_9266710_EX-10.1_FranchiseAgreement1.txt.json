                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly excludes certain items like sales taxes and customer refunds from 'Gross Revenues'. The modified text removes this exclusion, creating ambiguity and a potential contradiction. Other sections still reference 'Gross Revenues' with the expectation that these exclusions apply, but the modified definition no longer supports that assumption. This affects royalty calculations and other financial obligations, making enforcement uncertain.",

Policies that we require must be written by an insurance company reasonably satisfactory to us with an A.M. Best rating of \"A\" or better, and, must name us as an additional insured party. At a minimum, such policies must include the following: (a) commercial general liability insurance, completed-operations and independent-contractors coverage in the amount of $1,000,000, per person/per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined with a general aggregate of $3,000,000.\n(b) workers'-compensation coverage in the amount of at least $100,000/$500,000/$100,000, unemployment insurance and employer's liability insurance, as well as such other insurance as may be required by statute or rule of the state in which the Franchised Business is located;\n(c) fire, lightning, vandalism, theft, malicious mischief, flood (if in a special flood-hazard area), sprinkler damage, and the perils described in ex-tended-coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full-replacement value of the supplies, furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery, inventory, and plate glass having a deductible of not more than $1,000 and naming us as a loss payee;\n(d) automobile liability insurance-including coverage of vehicles not owned by you, but used by employees in connection with the Franchised Business, with a combination of primary and excess limits of not less than $1,000,000;\n(e) commercial blanket bond in the amount of $100,000; and\n(f) such other insurance, in such amounts, as we reasonably require for our and your protection. At any time, we may adjust the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance.",

The modified version removes these specifics, stating only that the franchisee must maintain insurance types and amounts 'as we may require'. This omission creates uncertainty and potential contradiction. Other sections may reference the expectation of specific coverage levels, but this section now allows the franchisor to set those levels arbitrarily. If no additional documentation outlines those standards, enforcement becomes difficult.",

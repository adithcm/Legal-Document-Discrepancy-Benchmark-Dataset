The Royalty is in consideration of your right to use the Proprietary Marks and the System in accordance with this Agreement, and not in exchange for any specific services we render. If by reason of state or other law, we are prohibited from receiving a percentage of certain components of Gross Revenues (including alcoholic-beverage sales), you must pay us an equivalent amount by increasing the Royalty percentage applied to Gross Revenues exclusive of the prohibited components.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the royalty percentage, 'equal to six percent (6%) of your Gross Revenues' creates ambiguity. The text still mandates a 'Royalty' payment but provides no clear calculation method, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'by the opening deadline specified in Appendix A' creates an inconsistency. The text still refers to an opening deadline implicitly, but the contract no longer specifies it. This contradiction makes the clause unenforceable as the franchisee has no clearly defined timeframe.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'and standards that we may periodically prescribe in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles' , this creates a contradiction. The requirement to comply with 'specifications' remains, but the location of those specifications is removed, causing uncertainty. It is now unclear where the franchisee should find these specifications, making this requirement difficult to enforce.",

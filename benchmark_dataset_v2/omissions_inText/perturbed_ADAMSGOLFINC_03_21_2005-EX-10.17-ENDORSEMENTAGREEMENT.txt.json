                "explanation": "The original definition of 'PRODUCT' included specific types of golf clubs (metal woods, drivers, etc.), bags, and headwear. By shortening it to just 'golf clubs,' it creates ambiguity. Later sections discuss 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' which are a subset of PRODUCT. If PRODUCT isn't clearly defined, it's unclear which specific items CONSULTANT is obligated to use.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specific listing of what constitutes 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS', we introduce a contradiction. Section 5 states 'CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT.' Without a clear definition of which products are considered 'mandatory,' this clause becomes unenforceable. It creates a conflict between the obligation to use MANDATORY PRODUCTS and the lack of clarity on what those products are.",

                "explanation": "By changing all instances of 'MANDATORY PRODUCT' to 'PRODUCT' within this section, we create a contradiction. Section 7 originally addressed the consultant's satisfaction with only the 'MANDATORY PRODUCT'. Now, it discusses satisfaction with all 'PRODUCT'. Given the modified definition of 'PRODUCT' and 'MANDATORY PRODUCTS' in section 2, this implies the consultant can terminate the agreement if they are not satisfied with any ADAMS GOLF club, bag, or headwear, even if they are not required to use those items. This broadens the termination clause beyond the original intent and creates uncertainty. This interacts with the omission in section 2 where MANDATORY PRODUCTS are not clearly defined anymore.",

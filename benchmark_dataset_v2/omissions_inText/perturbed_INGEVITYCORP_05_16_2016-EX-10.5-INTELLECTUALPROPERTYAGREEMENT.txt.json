This creates an internal contradiction, making it unclear what constitutes Intellectual Property under the agreement and creating uncertainty regarding the scope of the licenses, transfer of assets, and indemnification obligations related to Intellectual Property.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

Except as may otherwise be mutually agreed by the Parties, as between the Parties, SpinCo shall have the right to enforce the Licensed SpinCo IP as follows:   (i)  SpinCo shall have the right, but not the obligation (through itself and/or through its designee), to control the initiation, conduct and, subject to this  Section 3.6, settlement or other resolution, at its cost and expense and in its sole discretion, of any enforcement claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal or in law or in equity (each, an \"IP Action\") relating to the Licensed SpinCo IP, including the right to communicate any objection or other form of challenge to any Third Party; and  (ii)  if SpinCo does not initiate such an IP Action itself or through its designee with respect to infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Licensed SpinCo IP within the Parent Field by a Third Party within ninety (90) days after receipt of a written request from Parent to assume control over the enforcement of such violation of such Licensed SpinCo IP inside the Parent Field, then Parent shall have, with the prior consent of SpinCo, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the right, but not the obligation, to bring and to control such IP Action (provided that if Parent does not do so within thirty (30) days after the end of such original ninety (90) day-deadline, the right to initiate and control an IP Action shall revert back to SpinCo and shall again be subject to the terms set forth above). For avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not have any right to initiate any IP Action with respect to infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Licensed SpinCo IP by a Third Party except within the Parent Field.",

                "explanation": "By removing the rest of Section 3.6, particularly subsections (i) and (ii), the contract provides that SpinCo has the right to enforce the Licensed SpinCo IP, but removes the specific mechanism for how this is done, and the conditions under which the Parent can also enforce it. The section continues to reference 'Enforcing Party' and 'Non-Enforcing Party' later on, but this section is a condition. This creates an inconsistency and uncertainty because it is not mentioned how that enforcement is controlled between entities. This omission creates an in-text contradiction.",

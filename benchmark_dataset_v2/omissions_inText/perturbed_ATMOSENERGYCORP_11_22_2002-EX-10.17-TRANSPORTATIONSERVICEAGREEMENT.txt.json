                "explanation": "By removing \"expressed in Dekatherms (Dth),\" from the MDDO definition, and by further modifying the language to be generally descriptive and non-specific as to measurement, creates ambiguity and contradiction. The MDQ is explicitly defined in Dth, but the MDDO lacks this, potentially leading to disputes over measurement units even though Exhibit B uses 'Dth/d'.",

If Releasing Shipper chooses to provide weighting factors in                   accordance with Section 14.9 of the General Terms and                   Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, weighting factors                   are as follows: Please provide a range for each factor between                   0 - 1,000.

                "explanation": "By removing 'highest rate, net revenue or present value', the methodology for bid evaluation becomes unclear and less comprehensive, potentially leading to arbitrary decisions. Omitting the instruction to 'Please provide a range for each factor between 0 - 1,000. The numbers need not add up to 1,000' introduces an omission creating inconsistency between the statement about weighting factors and the practical implementation as there is no guidance.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"in accordance with its bid\" provides an omission because it disconnects the partial assignment of capacity to the specific bid which includes pricing, volumes, receipt & delivery points, etc., leading to uncertainty about the financial obligations of the Replacement Shipper. Omitting \"volumetric charges, surcharges,\" and specifying that only \"all charges\" will be applied, also creates ambiguity.",

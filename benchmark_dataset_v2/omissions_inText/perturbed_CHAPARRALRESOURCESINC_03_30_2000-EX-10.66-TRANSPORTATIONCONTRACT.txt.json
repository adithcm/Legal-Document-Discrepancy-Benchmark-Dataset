                "explanation": "By removing the specific amount of the fee ($1.00), the contract becomes ambiguous about the exact amount the Principal needs to pay, leading to potential disputes and difficulties in enforcement. Section 5.1 still dictates that a fee must be paid, but the lack of a defined monetary value creates an internal contradiction, as the payment obligation is undefined. The original fixed fee becomes a variable one.",

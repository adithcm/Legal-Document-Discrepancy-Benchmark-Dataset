Fees with respect to purchases                affected with the  assistance of a  broker/dealer  other than the                Agent shall be  transmitted  by the Agent to such  broker/dealer.\n                The decision to utilize selected  broker-dealers  will be made by                the Bank upon  consultation  with the Agent.  In the event,  with                respect to any  purchases  of Shares,  fees are paid  pursuant to                this subparagraph 2(c), such fees shall be in lieu of, and not in                addition to, payment pursuant to subparagraph 2(a) and 2(b).\n\n          (d)  The Company  will bear those  expenses of the  proposed  offering                customarily  borne by  issuers,  including,  without  limitation,                regulatory   filing  fees,   \"Blue  Sky,\"  and  NASD  filing  and                registration  fees;  the  fees  of  the  Company's   accountants,                attorneys,  appraiser,  transfer agent and  registrar,  printing,                mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses  associated with the                Offering;  the fees set  forth in  Section  2; and fees for \"Blue                Sky\" legal work.

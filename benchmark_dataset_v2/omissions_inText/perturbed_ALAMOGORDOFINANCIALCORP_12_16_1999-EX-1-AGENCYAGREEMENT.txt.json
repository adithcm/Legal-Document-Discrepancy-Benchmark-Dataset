                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 2(d), 8 and 9 hereof) shall terminate upon the completion or termination or abandonment of the Plan by the Company or upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than the date (the \"End Date\") which is 45 days after the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date.",
                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon the completion or termination or abandonment of the Plan by the Company or upon termination of the Offering. All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date.",
                "explanation": "By removing the exception clause referencing Sections 2(d), 8, and 9, the modified text creates an inconsistency. Later in the agreement, these sections deal with Agent's expenses and indemnification. By stating ALL obligations terminate, the altered text suggests Agent's right to reimbursement and indemnification also ends upon termination, which would contradict the intention of Sections 8 and 9.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"in the manner set forth in the Prospectus under the caption 'Use of Proceeds'\" creates a contradiction if the Prospectus contains specific stipulations on the usage of funds. The original statement mandates compliance, while the modified statement grants discretion, directly conflicting with prospectus requirements.",

                "original_text": "In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the MHC, the Bank or the Agent, the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding of any claims asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, the MHC, the Bank or the Agent from persons other than the other party thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Company, the MHC and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance.",

The contribution will be split equally between all parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a contribution method based on the Agent's fees relative to the gross proceeds. The edited version removes this defined calculation and introduces an equal split. If Section 8, or other areas, operate on an understanding of proportional responsibility, then \"equally between all parties\" would cause internal contradiction and render enforcement unclear.",

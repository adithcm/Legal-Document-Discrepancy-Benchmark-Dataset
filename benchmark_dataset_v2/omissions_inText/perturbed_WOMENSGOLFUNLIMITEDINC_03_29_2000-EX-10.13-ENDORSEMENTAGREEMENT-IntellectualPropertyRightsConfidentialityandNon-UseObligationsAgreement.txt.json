                "original_text": "The Professional acknowledges her obligations under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations Agreement attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and made a part hereof by this reference. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Exhibit A shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances of the termination or expiration.",
                "changed_text": "The Professional acknowledges her obligations related to intellectual property rights and confidentiality. The details of these obligations are subject to separate negotiation.",
                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Exhibit A,' which outlines specific intellectual property and confidentiality obligations, and replacing it with a vague statement about 'separate negotiation,' the contract becomes ambiguous. Later clauses (e.g., concerning ownership of Intellectual Property) still operate as though a concrete agreement exists (referencing all new discoveries, inventions), but the foundation for that agreement (Exhibit A) is removed, creating a contradiction. There is no document to clearly define the Recipient's obligations, creating uncertainty.",

Recipient hereby assigns and agrees to assign all Recipient's rights in any Intellectual Property to the Company. Recipient hereby grants to the Company power of attorney for the purpose of assigning all Recipient's rights in Intellectual Property to the Company for the purposes of filings, registrations and other formalities deemed necessary by the Company to prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit its ownership and interests in Intellectual Property. Recipient further agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver any documentation, instruments, specifications or disclosures necessary to assign, prosecute, protect, perfect or exploit the Company ownership of Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "(f) Recipient further acknowledges and agrees that Intellectual Property created during her work for the Company may be subject to certain ownership rights. Recipient agrees to cooperate in defining the specifics of these ownership rights as needed.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the explicit assignment of all intellectual property rights to the company. This contradicts any implicit assumption of company ownership of Intellectual Property and creates potential ambiguity about who owns what. The definition of 'Intellectual Property' from the original text is implicitly still understood as being in force, but the section now states IP ownership 'may be subject to certain ownership rights.'",

                "original_text": "(g) Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Company possesses valuable know-how, proprietary, confidential and trade secret Information that has been procured or developed by the Company at great expense and that its unauthorized disclosure would result in substantial damages to the Company that may not be adequately compensated by monetary relief. Accordingly, Recipient hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey and agrees that the Company may seek temporary restraining orders against it or other extraordinary relief necessary to protect the Information.",
                "changed_text": "(g) Recipient acknowledges that the Company may have confidential information. Recipient agrees to consider the Company's interests in protecting such information. The specific legal remedies available to the Company are subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "This change waters down the acknowledgment of the Company's proprietary information and removes the consent to specific jurisdiction and extraordinary relief. This creates a contradiction because the earlier changed clause 11.7 now makes all of Exhibit A and the protection and acknowledgment of trade secrets from this section, making any enforcement much weaker and less clear. Previously, the contract acknowledged the risk of substantial damages and agreed to specific legal recourse. Now, the acknowledgment is weaker, and the remedies are 'subject to negotiation'.",

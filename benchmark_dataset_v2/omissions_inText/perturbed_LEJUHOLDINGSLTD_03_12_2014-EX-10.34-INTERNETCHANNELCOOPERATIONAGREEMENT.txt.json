                "explanation": "The definition of 'PRC Laws' is changed from definitive legal documents to 'guidance and recommendations', conflicting with later sections requiring compliance with PRC Laws. 'Business Secrets' definition is stripped, removing critical protections. 'Effective Date' is altered, creating ambiguity. The definition of 'Force Majeure' is undermined by stating that those events are avoidable, contradicting the general understanding and application of force majeure. The website and channel definitions are over-simplified and vague.",

Party A warrants that such key word will be promoted on the open search platform of Baidu and preferentially displayed at the left side of the search result pages, the exact display position of which is subject to separate agreement between the Parties. The search results will link to the real estate and home furnishing channel under cooperation of the Parties. The key words will be provided to Party B to Party A, and the information included in any of the key words and their search results will be in compliance with laws and regulations, as well as business rules of Party A, including without limitation user's experience. Party B agrees that Party A may modify the display of search results out of consideration relating to user experience, provided that such modification will not materially change the display, content and position of the search results. Party A will be deemed in breach of this Agreement if it is required to modify search results pursuant to laws, regulations, court rulings or other mandatory documents.",

                "explanation": "By removing the guaranteed preferential display position and the specific requirements for keyword promotion, this weakens Party A's obligations. The specific display terms have been removed, giving Party A discretion. Since the original states that exact display position is subject to separate agreement, the removal of that clause and the original guarantee creates ambiguity. Finally, the section where Party A will be deemed in breach of agreement has been removed, thus harming Party B's interest.",

                "explanation": "By removing \"(which consent may not be withheld without reason)\", Party A's consent can be arbitrarily withheld, hindering Party B's marketing efforts. The clause specifying Party B's participation has been removed from 8.2. Most importantly, the removal of the definition of Business Secret, and changing the text from \"Business Secret\" to simply \"Information\" removes any real protection of Party A or B's critical data. Furthermore, the exclusion conditions 'without any non-disclosure obligation' are now removed from clauses A and B, meaning Party B can claim a public announcement that occurred decades ago counts as known information.",

                "explanation": "By omitting the certification clause about compliance with cGMP, Applicable Laws, and Product Specifications, a contradiction is created. Other clauses in the contract require compliance with these standards, but this definition no longer mandates it, leading to uncertainty about whether the analysis must confirm compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original definition provides a framework for commercially reasonable efforts requiring certain actions and resources. By removing the actions and resources the new definition contradicts other sections requiring 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' because it is now based on subjective interpretation, creating uncertainty on the specific obligations.",

In the event that any payment due under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement is not made when due, the payment shall accrue interest from the date due at a rate per annum equal to [***] above the U.S. Prime Rate (as set forth in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern U.S. Edition) for the date on which payment was due, calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year, or similar reputable data source; provided that in no event shall such rate exceed the maximum legal annual interest rate. The payment of such interest shall not limit a Party from exercising any other rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the rate of interest, there is an omission that causes an in-text contradiction. There is still a reference to late payments accruing interest, but there is no rate specified creating an uncertainty in the clause and how it can be enforced. This creates an internal contradiction.",

Distributor represents, warrants, and covenants to Zogenix that: (a) in the performance of its obligations hereunder, Distributor shall comply and shall cause its and its Affiliates' and Sub-distributors' employees and contractors to comply with Applicable Law and Distributor's compliance policies, complete copies of which will be provided to Zogenix before the launch of the Product in the Territory; (b) during the Term, Distributor agrees that: (i) Zogenix will have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice and during Distributor's regular business hours, to audit Distributor's and its Affiliates' books and records by an independent certified public accounting firm of recognized international standing, and Distributor shall ensure that Zogenix has the right to audit its Sub-distributors' and subcontractors' books and records, to investigation potential violations of any of the representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA or other Applicable Laws or Distributor's compliance policies. Such audit may be made no more than once each Fiscal Year (unless an audit reveals a violation under this Agreement, in which case an additional audit may be conducted within such Fiscal Year); (ii) Distributor will certify to Zogenix annually in writing or otherwise upon Zogenix's written request, under the form set forth in Exhibit 10.2(b) attached hereto, Distributor's compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants in this Section 10.2, the FCPA and other Applicable Laws and Distributor's compliance policies; (iii) Distributor will inform Zogenix promptly of any changes in its business that would change any of its representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2; (iv) Zogenix shall have the right to suspend or terminate the supply of Product under the Supply Agreement and to terminate this Agreement if there is credible evidence that Distributor or its Affiliate or Sub-distributor may have violated any of the representations, warranties or covenants in this Section 10.2 the FCPA or other Applicable Laws or Distributor's compliance policies.",

                "explanation": "The original clause details Distributors' specific representation of compliance with regulations. The modification removes the audit rights, compliance certification process, and notification obligations. This creates a contradiction because the Distributor is still required to comply with Applicable Law, but the processes for verifying compliance no longer exist. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

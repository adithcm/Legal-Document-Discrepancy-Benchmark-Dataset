                "original_text": "1.1  \"Above-the-Fold\" means the portion of a page that is designed to be visible\n      on a standard computer screen with a resolution of 640 pixels by 480 pixels\n      without requiring the user to scroll horizontally or vertically through the\n      page.",
                "changed_text": "1.1  \"Above-the-Fold\" means the portion of a page that is generally considered visible without scrolling. Specific dimensions are subject to change based on Intuit's site design.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Above-the-Fold\" is precise (640x480 resolution). The modified definition introduces ambiguity by removing the specific resolution and stating dimensions are subject to change. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the client can no longer rely on a fixed standard for ad placement. This is an in-text contradiction if other clauses rely on a fixed definition.",

                "changed_text": "1.4  \"Client Competitor\" means any entity that Intuit, in its sole discretion, deems to be a competitor of the Client in the electronic postage market.",
                "explanation": "The original definition links Client Competitors to Exhibit A, providing a defined list. The modified definition gives Intuit sole discretion to determine who is a competitor. This creates a contradiction because Section 9, Exclusivity, relies on a clear definition of 'Client Competitor'. Now Intuit could unilaterally expand the definition to include entities not originally contemplated, affecting Client's exclusivity protection.",

Intuit or its Authorized Advertisement Server will provide Client\n      -------      with monthly reports (\"Usage Reports\") substantiating the number of\n      Impressions of Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor\n      Client Graphics and Links displayed on the Intuit Sites, the total number\n      of click-throughs generated by each such advertisement or graphic, and such\n      other information as the parties shall mutually agree.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies monthly reports providing substantiation of impressions and click-throughs. The modified text is vague ('periodic reports') and gives Intuit discretion over the format and frequency. This contradicts sections 2-7 that depend on impression counts for promotional value and Section 12.1 that speaks of the term ending when a total number of impressions is reached, as the method of tracking those impressions is now undefined.",

                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay premiums on the Policy as provided under the Policy. In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "The Company may choose to pay premiums on the Policy. In the event this Agreement is terminated, the obligation to pay premiums will be determined at the discretion of the Company's CFO.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"agrees to pay premiums\" to \"may choose to pay premiums,\" the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the Company's financial commitment. The original text mandates premium payments, while the altered text makes it optional. Referencing the CFO's discretion further obfuscates the premium payment responsibility, creating a contradiction with other sections that might assume mandatory payments for the Policy to remain active.",

                "original_text": "In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of a \"Company Default\", the Trust may negotiate with the Company regarding potential remedies. If the Company fails to address the issues raised by the Trust, the Trust may consider various actions.",
                "explanation": "Removing the specific timeframe for curing a 'Company Default' and the Trust's right to demand the transfer of the Policy introduces significant uncertainty. The altered text replaces a defined right with a vague negotiation process. Since the definition of 'Company Default' still exists within the contract, this creates a contradiction. The original text offers clear recourse (policy transfer), while the modified version leaves the Trust's options undefined and subject to negotiation, which may never resolve the default, undermining the original intention of this clause. It also makes enforcement difficult since there are no clear steps.",

                "original_text": "Claims Procedures. If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed with the Plan Administrator or its designee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing and shall be delivered to all parties in interest in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 8 hereof. Such decision shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within ninety (90) days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claim for benefits. If the Plan Administrator fails to notify the claimant of its decision regarding the claim, the claim shall be considered denied, and the claimant then shall be permitted to proceed with an appeal as provided for in this Section 14.",
                "changed_text": "Claims Procedures. If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any claim will be addressed at the discretion of the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator will endeavor to communicate its decision. Further actions will be defined per internal guidelines.",
                "explanation": "By removing the detailed procedural steps for claims and appeals, and the specific timelines, the contract now introduces a significant lack of clarity. The phrase 'at the discretion of the Plan Administrator' contradicts the original intention of having a transparent and defined claims process under ERISA. The reference to 'internal guidelines' removes crucial information regarding the claims process from the contract, creating a contradiction and making it unenforceable in its previous context since it is no longer binding. The Plan Administrator has no specific guidelines to follow, making this difficult to enforce.",

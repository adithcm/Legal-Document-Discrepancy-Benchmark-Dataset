Upon the death of the survivor of the Insureds, the death benefit under the Policy (including any interest payable under the Policy in respect of such death benefit for the period from the date of death of such survivor until the payment of the death benefit) shall be divided as follows: (a) The Company shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the aggregate premiums paid under the Policy since inception less the amount of the then outstanding principal balance of the Demand Note (the \"Company Death Benefit\"). (If the Policy provides for a death benefit equal to the sum of the face amount of the Policy and any cash account or accumulation value, the Company Death Benefit shall first be paid from the cash account or accumulation value portion of the death benefit.) 3 (b) The Trust shall be entitled to receive the excess, if any, of the Policy's death benefit over the Company Death Benefit. (c) If any interest is payable under the Policy in respect of the death benefit for the period from the date of death of such survivor until the payment of the death benefit, the Company and the Trust shall share in such interest in proportion that their respective share of such death benefit (as determined under Section 6(a) and (b) hereof) bears to the total death benefit, excluding any interest thereon.",

                "explanation": "By removing the specification for how the Company and Trust should share interest earned in Section 6(c), based on sections 6(a) and 6(b), it now becomes unclear how this interest should be divided and creates an inconsistency because it previously outlined exactly how the interest was shared in proportion to the death benefit.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust' from the definition of 'Company Default', it creates an inconsistency because Section 3 still mentions: 'Other than as specifically allowed herein, the Company shall not borrow from, hypothecate, withdraw cash value from, surrender in whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber the Policy without the prior written consent of the Trustees of the Trust'.

If this Agreement is subject to ERISA, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed with the Plan Administrator or its designee which shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing and shall be delivered to all parties in interest in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 8 hereof. Such decision shall set forth the reasons for denial in plain language. Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided. This notice of denial of benefits will be provided within ninety (90) days of the Plan Administrator's receipt of the claim for benefits. If the Plan 5 Administrator fails to notify the claimant of its decision regarding the claim, the claim shall be considered denied, and the claimant then shall be permitted to proceed with an appeal as provided for in this Section 14. A claimant who has been completely or partially denied a benefit shall be entitled to appeal this denial of his or her claim by filing a written statement of his or her position with the Plan Administrator no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the written notification of such denial. The Plan Administrator shall schedule an opportunity for a full and fair review of the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal. The decision on review shall set forth specific reasons for the decision, and shall cite specific references to the pertinent provisions of the Agreement on which the decision is based. Following the review of any additional information submitted by the claimant, either through the hearing process or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request for review (or within 120 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). The Plan Administrator shall deliver the decision to the claimant in writing. If an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. If the decision on review is not furnished within the prescribed time, the claim shall be deemed denied on review.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided' from Section 14, it implies that claimants may not receive assistance in perfecting their claims, yet the rest of the section still allows them to appeal. This creates an internal contradiction regarding how the claimant can proceed with their claim if they need to perfect it.",

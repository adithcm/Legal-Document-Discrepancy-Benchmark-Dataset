                "type": "Omissions - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party B shall have valid and legal licenses for national road transportation. In the event of loss caused to Party A by delivery delay due to vehicles detention for the lack of license, Party B shall compensate for any loss to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall have licenses for road transportation. In the event of loss caused to Party A by delivery delay, Party B shall compensate for any loss to Party A.",
                "explanation": "By removing the terms 'valid' 'legal' 'national' and 'due to vehicles detention for the lack of license', we introduce ambiguity. The modified text implies Party B only needs *any* road transportation licenses, irrespective of their validity or legality. Additionally, the causal link between lack of license and delay is removed. This creates uncertainty about what constitutes a valid claim for compensation related to delivery delays.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of parcel damage, Party B shall indemnify.",
                "explanation": "The removal of the phrase specifying the 'standard rate of RMB200 per parcel' and the details regarding 'high-end insured parcels' creates ambiguity. While the obligation to 'indemnify' remains, the *method* and *amount* of indemnification are unspecified. This omission leads to an in-text contradiction because other sections might still refer to a standard indemnification rate, which no longer exists within the explicitly stated terms of this particular clause.",

Party B's drivers shall have at least two years driving experience in large trucks and have relevant licenses. Party B shall bear any consequences and legal liability arising out of Party B's non-compliance, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall provide copies of licenses to Party A. Party B shall bear any consequences and legal liability arising out of Party B's non-compliance, and Party A shall have no liability.",
                "explanation": "By removing the details relating to what specific licenses, experience, guarantees, and the validity guarantees, the contract now has a significant omission. It is no longer clear which specific licenses need to be provided, and the experience requirement is removed. The obligation for Party B to bear consequences for non-compliance remains, but what constitutes compliance is now much less defined, making enforcement difficult and creating an internal contradiction if other sections refer to those detailed licensing requirements.",

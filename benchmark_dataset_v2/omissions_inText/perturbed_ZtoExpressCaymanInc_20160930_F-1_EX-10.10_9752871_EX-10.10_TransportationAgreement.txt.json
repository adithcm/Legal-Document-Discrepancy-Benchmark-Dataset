In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the parcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",

                "explanation": "The specific indemnification amounts for parcel damage due to leakage or fire (RMB200 per parcel, actual price for high-end insured parcels) have been removed. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty in enforcement regarding the amount of compensation Party B is required to pay. Section 9 states Party A can terminate if Party B breaches above articles, but now the 'above article' has no rate making it hard to enforce, creating the internal contradiction.",

Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight. In the special event of changes to route and time and severe weather (or other force majeure events), Party B shall be in touch with Party A in time and record such special event on the parcel transfer documents with Party A's approval.",

                "explanation": "The specific liquidated damages amounts for delivery delays (RMB500/1000/2000 per trip) have been removed, only saying Party B 'may be subject to damages'. This omission creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the method for calculating damages is no longer defined.

                "explanation": "The clause specifying 'one-month freight as liquidated damages' is removed. This leaves the 'damages' amount undefined, creating a significant uncertainty regarding the financial penalty for early termination. Since Section 3 specifies how freight is calculated, removing 'one-month freight' makes the cost associated with breaking the agreement undefined.",

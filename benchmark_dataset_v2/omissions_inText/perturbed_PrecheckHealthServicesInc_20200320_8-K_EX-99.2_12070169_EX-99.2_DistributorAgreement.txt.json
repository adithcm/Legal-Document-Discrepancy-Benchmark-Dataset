CONDITIONS: 1. The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal's qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the \"Products\"). The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",

CONDITIONS: 1. The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal's qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the \"Products\"). The Products are described vaguely.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific licensing and registration requirements and replacing \"fully licensed and registered in the Territory\" with a general reference to providing distribution services, there's a contradiction with the requirement in clause 7 stating \"The Distributor shall obtain at its own expense, all necessary licenses and permits to allow the Distributor to conduct business as contemplated herein.\" This creates uncertainty around the distributor's obligations regarding licensing and registration. Furthermore, products listed is vague, making enforcement uncertain. Removing Exhibits is also inconsistent with mentioning it.",

                "explanation": "By removing the distributor's right to reject new product additions, clause 5 now contradicts clause 1 stating  \"The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal's qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the \"Products\")\". If the principal can unilaterally add products the distributor doesn't want to distribute, the agreement to sell those specific products in section 1 becomes unenforceable, as the distributor would be forced to sell any product the Principal chooses to add.",

                "explanation": "By removing clause 11, the agreement is now silent on what happens to existing orders upon termination. The Distributor is left with no clear guidance to fulfill if they were entitled to receive orders from termination. This directly contradicts a reasonable interpretation of ongoing commercial relationship until it gets terminated because it is vague.",

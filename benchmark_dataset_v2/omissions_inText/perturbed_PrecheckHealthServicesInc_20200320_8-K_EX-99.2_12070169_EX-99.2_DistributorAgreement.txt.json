The Principal appoints the Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor, to sell Principal's qPCR infectious disease kits, Logix Smart COVID-19 PCR diagnostic test and Co-Dx Box™ instrument (the \"Products\"). The Products are described on Exhibit A to this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "By removing the reference to 'Exhibit A', the agreement no longer explicitly defines the Products. However, other clauses still refer to 'the Products', creating ambiguity. This creates uncertainty because without Exhibit A, there's no clear, agreed-upon list of products the distributor is authorized to sell, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "Removing the phrase \"based on the Products and Prices\" creates a contradiction. Later in the clause discounts are mentioned but there is no reference made to what the discounts are based on.

                "explanation": "By removing 'Payment to be made upon shipment,' the contract lacks a defined payment term upon termination. However, the distributor retains the right to sell Products, creating a contradiction in terms because it is uncertain when payments should be given upon termination if a Distributor sells products.",

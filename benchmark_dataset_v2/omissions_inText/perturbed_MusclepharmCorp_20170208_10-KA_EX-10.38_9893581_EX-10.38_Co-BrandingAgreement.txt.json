                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Distribution Channels\" means the distribution of the Licensed Products through GNC retail and online chains worldwide during the First Contract Year and, thereafter, through MusclePharm's other worldwide distribution channels, as mutually determined by MusclePharm and the AS Parties.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Distribution Channels\" means the distribution of the Licensed Products through various retail outlets worldwide. Specific channels will be determined at MusclePharm's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a collaborative agreement on distribution channels post-first year. The modified text removes the requirement for mutual agreement and grants MusclePharm sole discretion, creating uncertainty and potential conflict if other clauses still reference a collaborative process.",

The AS Parties shall be entitled to approve the Marketing Plan, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires MusclePharm to provide a detailed marketing plan subject to AS Parties' approval. The modified text weakens this requirement by only mandating a 'general marketing overview' and diminishing the AS Parties' approval power to mere 'feedback,' creating a contradiction regarding marketing plan control if other sections presume joint approval.",

                "original_text": "To this end, MusclePharm will use the approval form attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\" to obtain required approvals under this Agreement (including, ingredients contained in the Licensed Products). Prior to any use of any of the Endorser IP, MusclePharm shall submit to the AS Parties for the AS Parties' prior written approval all artwork, photos, images, writings, advertising campaigns, slogans, claims made and other Name and Appearance Rights associated with the Endorser IP, samples of materials and design of the Licensed Products on which the Endorser IP are to appear and of all advertising, press and promotional literature which MusclePharm intends to use in the marketing or merchandising of the Licensed Products using the submission form in Exhibit \"E\" attached hereto. The AS Parties shall respond to any such approval request within ten (10) business days. To the extent that the AS Parties shall fail to respond within such ten (10 day) period, the submissions shall be deemed disapproved. Should MusclePharm desire to submit the same request for approval, the AS Parties shall respond within five (5) days detailing the reason for disapproval. Should the AS Parties fail to respond in this last Five (5) business day period, submission shall be deemed approved.",

                "explanation": "The original text establishes a structured approval process requiring AS Parties' written approval for all marketing and design materials, with specific deadlines. The modified text replaces this with a vague 'reasonable efforts' obligation and removes the strict approval requirement, granting MusclePharm ultimate control. If other clauses still refer to a formal approval process, this creates an internal contradiction.",

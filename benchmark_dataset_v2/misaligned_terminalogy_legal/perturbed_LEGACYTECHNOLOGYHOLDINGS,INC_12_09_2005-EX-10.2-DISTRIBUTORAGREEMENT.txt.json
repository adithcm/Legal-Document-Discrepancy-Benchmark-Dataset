                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "12. Independent Contractor Status. The parties acknowledge that ENVISION is an independent contractor and shall not be deemed to be an employee, agent, or joint venturer of SIERRA for any purpose, including federal tax purposes.",
                "changed_text": "12. Independent Contractor Status. The parties acknowledge that ENVISION is a contractor and shall be deemed to be an agent of SIERRA for the purpose of sales within the Territory.",
                "explanation": "By stating that ENVISION is 'a contractor' and 'an agent of SIERRA' for sales, the contract introduces contradiction. The original clause explicitly defines ENVISION as an 'independent contractor' to avoid employer-employee relationship implications. Now the contract recognizes them as an agent, which implies a level of control and responsibility that legally contradicts the definition of 'independent contractor'. This could potentially violate labor laws and create ambiguity regarding ENVISION's responsibilities.",

                "changed_text": "13. Warranty. SIERRA warrants that the Product shall be free from major defects.",
                "explanation": "The original wording regarding warranty specifies 'defects in material and workmanship for the reasonable shelf life of the Product', which provides a relatively clear benchmark. The change reduces this to 'free from major defects', which is vague. 'Major defects' lacks a concrete legal definition, thereby increasing the ambiguity about warranty responsibilities under product liability laws. A normal shelf life may be a year or two but a major defect may only be apparent at the time of use, creating uncertainty as to what falls under acceptable standards",

                "original_text": "4. Prices and Terms. The price for the Product as set forth in Section 9 herein, sold by SIERRA to ENVISION, shall be subject to change due to changes in manufacturing costs and so as to maximize profits; any changes in price for the Product shall not be applicable to previously accepted orders and shall be made with at least ninety (90) days advance notice in writing and in good faith by conference of the parties.",
                "changed_text": "4. Prices and Terms. The price for the Product as set forth in Section 9 herein, sold by SIERRA to ENVISION, shall be subject to change at any time and for any reason at Sierra's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original wording provided some protection to ENVISION by requiring 90-day notice and good faith negotiation for price changes. The modified version allows SIERRA to change prices 'at any time and for any reason at Sierra's sole discretion'. This eliminates the 'good faith' requirement. This contradicts basic principles of contract law that require fair dealing, and potentially renders the pricing agreement unenforceable under principles of unconscionability, by removing obligation for good faith negotiations.",

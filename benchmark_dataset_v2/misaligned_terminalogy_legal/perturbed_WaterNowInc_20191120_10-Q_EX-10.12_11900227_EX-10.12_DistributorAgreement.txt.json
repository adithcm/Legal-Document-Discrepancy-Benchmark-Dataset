                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Net Revenue\" means the gross revenue derived from the sale of the Hydrocarbons resulting from the Products, less (i) the share of gross revenue due to the Customers under the agreements between the Customers and the Distributor or any Affiliate of the Distributor, which is generally 50%, but may be greater or less than 50%, and (ii) ordinary and customary costs, expenses and fees that are deducted from the gross revenue.",
                "changed_text": "\"Net Revenue\" means the gross revenue derived from the sale of the Hydrocarbons resulting from the Products, without any deductions whatsoever. All expenses, costs, and fees, including shares due to customers, are to be considered separate from the calculation of Net Revenue.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Revenue' allows for deductions of customer shares and customary costs. The modified definition removes these deductions, which is a direct contradiction. This creates uncertainty about how revenue will be shared and what constitutes net profit, conflicting with standard accounting practices and potentially tax laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), potential tax code violations depending on how revenue is reported.",
                "location": "Article I. DEFINITIONS"

                "original_text": "\"Territory\" shall mean the geographic territories described on Exhibit B attached hereto, as such Exhibit may be amended from time to time by the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "\"Territory\" shall mean the general areas where the Distributor operates, irrespective of the specific boundaries outlined in Exhibit B. Exhibit B serves as a general guideline but is not legally binding.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly ties the 'Territory' to Exhibit B, which presumably defines specific geographic boundaries. The changed definition introduces ambiguity by stating Exhibit B is not legally binding, directly contradicting the initial definition. This creates uncertainty regarding the Distributor's exclusive rights and potential breach of contract claims, as the area of exclusivity is no longer clearly defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles related to definiteness and enforceability of territorial restrictions.",
                "location": "Article I. DEFINITIONS"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Hydraspin hereby grants to Distributor an exclusive non-transferable and royalty-free right and license to use Hydraspin's Marks in connection with the advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution and sale of the Products in the Territory in accordance with Hydraspin's standards and instructions. Distributor shall acquire no right, title or interest in or to the Marks, other than the above license, and Distributor shall not use any Mark as part of Distributor's corporate or trade name or permit any third person or party to do so without the prior written consent of Hydraspin.",
                "changed_text": "Hydraspin hereby grants to Distributor a general right to use Hydraspin's Marks, with no specific limitations on exclusivity or transferability, unless otherwise notified. Distributor shall eventually acquire the right, title or interest in or to the Marks as the business expands.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a very specific, limited license. The modified text contradicts several key aspects: it removes the 'exclusive' designation, implying a non-exclusive license; removes the 'non-transferable' restriction, and suggests the Distributor may eventually own the Marks. This creates ambiguity about the scope of the license and undermines Hydraspin's intellectual property rights and creates contradictions to intellectual property laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law, contract law principles related to license agreements.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means, in the case of nanomaterials and coated nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 54 kilograms or less, and, in the case of dispersions of nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 60 kilograms or less.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means, in the case of nanomaterials and coated nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 54 kilograms or less, and, in the case of dispersions of nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of any amount deemed reasonable by the seller.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the fixed quantity for dispersions with a subjective \"any amount deemed reasonable by the seller,\" this alteration introduces ambiguity. This contradicts the initial clarity of \"Research Quantities\" and could lead to disputes over what constitutes an acceptable quantity, undermining the contract's enforceability.",

Title to the Products, and the risk of loss or damage to the Products, each will pass to ALFA AESAR upon shipment from NTC's dock in compliance with United States D.O.T. requirements and all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 NTC shall ship Products at its discretion and will arrange delivery of the Products to ALFA AESAR using a carrier of its choosing. Title to the Products, and the risk of loss or damage to the Products, will pass to ALFA AESAR when the products arrive at ALFA AESAR's facilities, regardless of any transportation-related issues.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the title and risk of loss only pass upon arrival at ALFA AESAR's facilities, the contract contradicts standard shipping terms like FOB/FCA. This creates a legal contradiction because generally, FOB/FCA dictates that the buyer assumes responsibility once the goods are shipped, conflicting with this new provision.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Confidential Information\" is relatively standard, encompassing trade secrets, technical data, and other proprietary information. The modified definition significantly narrows this scope by excluding \"any data or knowledge that may incidentally be acquired during the business relationship.\" This creates a legal contradiction because it allows a party to argue that information obtained through direct business dealings is not confidential, even if it directly relates to trade secrets or proprietary processes, thus undermining the protection of confidential data.",

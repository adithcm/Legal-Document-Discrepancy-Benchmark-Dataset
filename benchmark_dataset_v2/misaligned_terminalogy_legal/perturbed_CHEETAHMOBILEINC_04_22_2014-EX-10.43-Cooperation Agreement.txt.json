                "original_text": "1.1.4 Force Majeure: means any event which is not reasonably controllable, foreseeable or avoidable even if foreseeable by the parties, which makes it impossible for either party to perform the whole or part of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Such event includes without limitation governmental actions, earthquakes, typhoon, flood, fire or any other natural disaster, wars or any other similar event. In respect of the special nature of the internet, Force Majeure also includes the following events which influence the normal operation of the internet: 1) hacker attacks; 2) material influence of the technical adjustments of the telecommunications department except for losses of one party resulting from its own mismanagement; 3) temporary suspension caused by governmental control, except for the governmental control on one party resulting from its own misconduct; 4) virus attacks.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.4 Force Majeure: means any event which the parties deem beyond their immediate control. Such events include, but are not limited to, inclement weather, minor technical glitches, or staffing shortages. In respect of the special nature of the internet, Force Majeure may also include website downtime or minor fluctuations in internet traffic.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Force Majeure aligns with standard legal interpretations, requiring events to be unforeseeable and uncontrollable. The modified definition broadens the scope to include events merely 'deemed beyond their immediate control,' encompassing events like 'inclement weather' or 'staffing shortages,' which are generally considered manageable business risks. This creates ambiguity and contradicts established legal precedents on what constitutes Force Majeure.",

                "original_text": "1.1.7 Actual revenues: means the revenues payable by Party B to Party A based on the amount of search traffic generated by Party A's website for Party B, less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges. The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party B based on its statistical data.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.7 Actual revenues: means the revenues Party B, at its sole discretion, decides to allocate to Party A. The amount of revenue to be paid to Party A will be based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, search traffic, market conditions, and Party B's internal budgeting decisions. The methodology for calculating revenues is confidential and will not be disclosed to Party A.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'actual revenues' to objectively measurable search traffic and deducts clearly defined costs. The modified definition makes revenue determination entirely discretionary by Party B, based on undisclosed criteria. This creates a contradiction because 'revenues' are typically understood as having some basis in measurable performance, not arbitrary allocation. It will give Party B unchecked power.",

                "original_text": "7.1 Any and all information acquired by the parties and their employees due to the execution or performance of this Agreement, including without limitation the scientific, business or internal information relating to technology, finance, marketing or management shall be the confidential information of the parties and their proprietary properties.",
                "changed_text": "7.1 Confidential information is limited to only documented intellectual property of either party. Any other information, including but not limited to business strategies, customer lists, or marketing data, shall not be considered confidential.",
                "explanation": "The original clause broadly defines confidential information. The modified clause drastically narrows this scope to only 'documented intellectual property.' This contradicts the conventional understanding of 'confidential information,' which often includes a broader range of proprietary business data. This change reduces enforceability and creates uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "1.26 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means: (a) with respect to the efforts to be expended, or considerations to be undertaken, by a Party or its Affiliate with respect to any objective, activity or decision to be undertaken hereunder, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective, activity or decision as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective, activity or decision under similar circumstances; and (b) with respect to Development and Commercialization of any Licensed Product for any indication by a Party, efforts and resources consistent with those efforts and resources commonly used by a similarly situated biotechnology company with respect to a product owned by it or to which it has similar rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account (i) the patent and other proprietary position of the Licensed Product and (ii) the anticipated profitability of the Licensed Product.",
                "changed_text": "1.26 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means: (a) with respect to the efforts to be expended, or considerations to be undertaken, by a Party or its Affiliate with respect to any objective, activity or decision to be undertaken hereunder, minimal efforts to accomplish such objective, activity or decision as such Party deems fit; and (b) with respect to Development and Commercialization of any Licensed Product for any indication by a Party, nominal efforts and resources deemed appropriate by the company's internal assessment, disregarding the product's market potential or patent position.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' aligns with standard legal interpretations, requiring good faith and consideration of market factors. The modified definition introduces a contradiction by suggesting 'minimal efforts' and disregarding 'market potential,' which conflicts with the usual understanding of this term in contract law, potentially leading to disputes over the level of effort required.",

If either Party receives a notice from a Third Party indicating that the Commercialization of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory infringes a Third Party Patent, it will promptly notify the other Party. The Parties will thereafter discuss a response in good faith. If the Parties agree in good faith that it is reasonable to enter into a license with such Third Party to avoid infringement of such Third Party patent(s)by the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory (each such license, a \"Required Third Party License\"), then CytoDyn shall have the right to negotiate the terms of such Required Third Party License and the amounts payable under such Required Third Party License shall be deducted from the royalties payable to CytoDyn.",

If either Party receives a notice from a Third Party indicating that the Commercialization of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory infringes a Third Party Patent, it will promptly notify the other Party. The Parties will thereafter discuss a response in good faith. Regardless of whether the Parties agree that entering into a license with such Third Party is necessary to avoid infringement of such Third Party patent(s)by the sale, offer for sale or use of a Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory (each such license, a \"Required Third Party License\"), then CytoDyn maintains sole discretion to negotiate the terms of such Required Third Party License and the amounts payable under such Required Third Party License shall be absorbed solely by Vyera without offset from royalties payable to CytoDyn.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original agreement on Required Third Party Licenses. Initially, it stipulated a good faith agreement between parties to determine the necessity of a third-party license. The revision gives CytoDyn unilateral authority to decide, and the payment terms shift entirely to Vyera, irrespective of mutual consent. This alters fundamental risk allocation and contradicts typical interpretations of shared responsibility in licensing agreements.",

Each Party agrees that, during the Term and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, a Party (the \"Receiving Party\") receiving Confidential Information of the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") shall: (a) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information using efforts it deems appropriate, regardless of the value or sensitivity of its own or the Disclosing Party's confidential information; (b) may disclose such Confidential Information to its subcontractors; and (c) may use such Confidential Information for any purpose it deems fit, irrespective of what is permitted by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification severely weakens the confidentiality obligations. Changing the protection standard to 'efforts it deems appropriate' removes the benchmark of equivalent care. Permitting disclosure to subcontractors and allowing information use for any purpose directly contradicts the original intent of protecting confidential information, rendering the clause practically unenforceable and deviating from established confidentiality norms in contract law.",

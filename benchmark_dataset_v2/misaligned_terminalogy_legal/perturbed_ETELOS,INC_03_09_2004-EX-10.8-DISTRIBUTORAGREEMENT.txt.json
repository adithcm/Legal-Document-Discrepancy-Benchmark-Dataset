                "original_text": "1.1 \"Products\" means the Tripath semiconductor products identified by Tripath in writing from time to time.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Products\" means any item sold by Distributor, regardless of origin or manufacturer.",
                "explanation": "The original contract defined 'Products' clearly as Tripath's semiconductors. The modified version broadens this to include any item sold by the distributor, creating conflict and uncertainty. This contradicts the initial intent of the agreement, making it unclear which products are subject to the agreement's terms and conditions.",

                "changed_text": "10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding any defects, manufacturing or otherwise, including but not limited to merchantability, title, and fitness for a particular purpose. All OEM products are sold 'as is.'",
                "explanation": "The original contract provides a one-year warranty for OEM products against defects. The modified version disclaims all warranties, including those implied by law such as merchantability. This creates a direct conflict, rendering the warranty provision unenforceable and contradictory to standard commercial practices.",

Any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement will be referred to and resolved by the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") in accordance with the ICC Arbitration Rules. The venue for such arbitration will be Santa Clara County, California, USA.",
                "changed_text": "21.7 Dispute Resolution. Any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement may, at either party's sole discretion, be resolved through binding arbitration, mediation, litigation, interpretive dance-off, or any other method the parties deem appropriate. The location of dispute resolution will be determined by a coin flip conducted in international waters.",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates arbitration through the ICC in Santa Clara County. The modified version introduces multiple, vague, and potentially unenforceable dispute resolution methods, contradicting the clarity and enforceability of the original arbitration clause. The 'coin flip' clause introduces randomness and uncertainty, rendering the dispute resolution process legally dubious.",

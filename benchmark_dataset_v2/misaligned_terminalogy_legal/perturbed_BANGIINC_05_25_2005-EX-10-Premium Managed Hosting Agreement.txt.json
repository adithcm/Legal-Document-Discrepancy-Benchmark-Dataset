                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Includes a 99 percent server uptime guarantee.",
                "changed_text": "Includes a 99 percent server uptime suggestion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'guarantee' to 'suggestion' significantly weakens the commitment. A guarantee implies a legal obligation to provide the stated uptime, while a suggestion does not. This creates uncertainty as to whether AstroNutrition.com can legally claim damages if the uptime falls below 99%.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract principles under Canadian law, specifically regarding enforceable promises.",

                "changed_text": "Management of site source code and possible integration of contributed software updates and bug fixes into zencart is included.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'integration' to 'possible integration', the contract introduces ambiguity about the service provider's obligations. 'Integration' is a defined task, which shifts to an option. This contradicts the intended scope of services, making enforcement uncertain should software updates not be integrated.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles related to clear and unambiguous terms for service agreements.",

                "changed_text": "This includes occasional off-site backups of the website itself and the database.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'regular' with 'occasional' alters the frequency of backups, undermining the commitment to data protection. Regular backups imply a consistent schedule. Occasional backups are vague and do not guarantee sufficient protection against data loss, contradicting reasonable expectations for managed hosting services.",
                "contradicted_law": "Data protection principles under Canadian privacy law (PIPEDA), and breach of contract related to expected service levels.",

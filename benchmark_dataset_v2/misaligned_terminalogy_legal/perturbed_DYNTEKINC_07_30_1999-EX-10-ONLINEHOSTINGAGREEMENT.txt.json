                "original_text": "Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to fifteen (15%) percent per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate to be determined at Tadeo's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification gives Tadeo the arbitrary power to set interest rates on late payments, which contradicts the established concept of a fixed or determinable interest rate under contract and commercial law. It creates uncertainty and potential for abuse, making enforcement of this clause problematic as it lacks a definite standard.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Tadeo and Diplomat are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between Tadeo and Diplomat. Neither Tadeo nor Diplomat shall have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent. When Tadeo's employees act under the terms of this Agreement, they shall be deemed at all times to be under the supervision and responsibility of Tadeo and no person employed by Tadeo and acting under the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to be acting as agent or employee of Diplomat or any customer of Diplomat for any purpose whatsoever.",
                "changed_text": "Tadeo and Diplomat are considered collaborators. While this agreement aims to avoid a formal partnership, Diplomat retains the right to direct specific tasks performed by Tadeo's personnel to ensure quality and alignment with Diplomat's objectives. Tadeo remains responsible for its employees, but Diplomat's directives will be followed.",
                "explanation": "By introducing the concept of 'direction' by Diplomat over Tadeo's personnel, the modification blurs the lines between an independent contractor relationship and an employer-employee relationship. This is a legal contradiction because independent contractors typically operate without direct supervision, whereas employees are subject to the control of their employer. The phrase 'Diplomat's directives will be followed' further solidifies this contradiction.",

                "original_text": "All materials, including but not limited to any computer software (in object code and source code form), data or information developed or provided by Tadeo, or its suppliers under this Agreement, and any know-how, methodologies, equipment, or processes used by Tadeo to provide the Services to Diplomat, including, without limitation, all copy-rights, trademarks, - 6 - patents, trade secrets, and any other proprietary rights inherent therein and appurtenant thereto (collectively, \"Host Materials\") shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Tadeo or its suppliers. To the extent, if any, that ownership of the Hose Materials does not automatically vest in Tadeo by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, Diplomat hereby transfers and assigns to Tadeo all rights, title and interest which Diplomat may have in and to the Host Materials. Diplomat acknowledges and agrees that Tadeo is in the business of designing and hosting Web sites, and that Tadeo shall have the right to provide to third parties services which are the same or similar to the Tadeo Services, and to use or otherwise exploit any Host Materials in providing such services.",
                "changed_text": "All materials, including any computer software, data, or information developed by Tadeo for Diplomat under this Agreement, are initially considered 'Joint Creations.' While Tadeo retains possession, Diplomat has a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use these materials. The specific ownership of copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets related to the Joint Creations will be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the contributions of both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the standard concept of 'sole and exclusive property' and introduces ambiguity regarding intellectual property ownership. By labeling the materials as 'Joint Creations' and stating that ownership will be determined on a case-by-case basis, it creates conflict with the initial statement that all materials shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Tadeo or its suppliers. Furthermore, it contradicts the clear assignment of rights to Tadeo outlined in the original language.",

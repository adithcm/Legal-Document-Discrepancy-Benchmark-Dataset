                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to fifteen (15%) percent per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate to be determined by Tadeo's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed interest rate for late payments. The modified text makes the interest rate discretionary, contradicting standard contract law principles which require clear and definite terms, especially regarding financial obligations. This uncertainty could render the interest clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring definiteness of terms, potentially violating state usury laws if applied unreasonably.",
                "location": "Section 2"

            {

                "original_text": "Tadeo will maintain accurate books, records and accounts of all transactions relating to the Services performed by it pursuant to this Agreement. Diplomat may, at its own expense, examine and copy those books and records as provided in this Section 4. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that allows Diplomat to separate these matters from those relating to Tadeo's other operations. Such books, records and accounts will reflect such information as would normally be examined by an independent accountant in performing an audit pursuant to United States generally accepted auditing standards for the purpose of certifying financial statements, and to permit verification thereof by governmental agencies.",
                "changed_text": "Tadeo will maintain records it deems appropriate, reflecting its internal accounting practices. Diplomat may request to examine these records at Tadeo's convenience. The level of detail and accounting standards used will be at Tadeo's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly reduces the obligation of Tadeo to maintain records according to GAAP standards, removing the basis for financial accuracy. Allowing Tadeo to determine the 'level of detail' undermines Diplomat's ability to audit or verify the financial information, contradicting the original intent and potentially violating accounting standards if used to conceal relevant information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.",

                "original_text": "All materials, including but not limited to any computer software (in object code and source code form), data or information developed or provided by Tadeo, or its suppliers under this Agreement, and any know-how, methodologies, equipment, or processes used by Tadeo to provide the Services to Diplomat, including, without limitation, all copy-rights, trademarks,\npatents, trade secrets, and any other proprietary rights inherent therein and appurtenant thereto (collectively, \"Host Materials\") shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Tadeo or its suppliers.",
                "changed_text": "All tangible items provided by Tadeo or its suppliers will be owned by Tadeo. Copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets will be jointly owned by both parties.",
                "explanation": "By stating that 'intangible' properties (copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets) will be jointly owned, this creates a contradiction. The original text clearly states the 'Host Materials' belong exclusively to Tadeo. Changing the 'ownership' definition introduces uncertainty and potential disputes over intellectual property rights and usage, which could be challenged under copyright or patent law depending on the jurisdiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Copyright Act, Patent Act, Trade Secret laws (depending on jurisdiction)",

                "original_text": "\"Care Management Services\" means the business of providing utilization review (which includes, but is not limited to, pre-admission certification, prior authorization, prospective length of stay approvals, second opinions, concurrent review and discharge planning), catastrophic medical case management, disease management and demand management (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) services to benefits payors and health providers, in all cases in accordance with the terms of the applicable Client Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"Care Management Services\" shall generally refer to administrative healthcare support. Specific services may include certain utilization reviews as deemed necessary by HPS, or catastrophic medical situations.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a detailed definition of “Care Management Services.” The modified text offers a vague, non-specific description, contradicting the initial definition and creating uncertainty about the actual services SHPS is obligated to provide. This is further exacerbated by granting HPS discretion over which specific utilization reviews are included, differing from generally accepted definitions under Florida healthcare regulations. Because services are not listed explicitly, it would be difficult to bring legal action due to lack of specificity.",

In the event that either party materially or repeatedly defaults in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder and does not substantially cure such default within thirty days after being given written notice specifying the default, or, with respect to those defaults which cannot reasonably be cured within thirty days, if the defaulting party fails to proceed promptly after being given such notice to commence curing the default and thereafter to reasonably proceed to cure the same, then the party not in default 2 may, by giving written notice to the defaulting party, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. In the event that either party is not performing to the satisfaction of the other, the agreement may be terminated with or without cause. It is at the discretion of the terminating party.",
                "explanation": "The original 'Termination for Cause' clause requires a 'material' or 'repeated' default that is not cured within a specific timeframe. The modified clause allows termination 'with or without cause' if one party is 'not performing to the satisfaction of the other', making the standards for termination entirely subjective. This misaligns with Florida contract law principles that emphasize the importance of objective standards for termination, and materially alters the defined rights and obligations. This could result in unpredictable enforcement.",

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either of the parties a joint venturer or partner of the other.",
                "changed_text": "4.6 RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES. SHPS shall operate as an independent contractor. However, HPS retains the right to direct SHPS's operational strategies to ensure market relevance.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes SHPS as an 'independent contractor'. The modification states HPS retains control of 'operational strategies', potentially contradicting the definition of an independent contractor. Under Florida law, a key factor in determining independent contractor status is the degree of control the principal has over the work. If HPS dictates SHPS's 'operational strategies', it blurs the line between independent contractor and employee, which can have significant legal ramifications for taxation, liability, and benefits. This change can make the nature of SHPS's employment uncertain.",

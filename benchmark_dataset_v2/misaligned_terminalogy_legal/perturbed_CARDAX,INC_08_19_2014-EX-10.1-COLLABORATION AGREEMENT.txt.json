                "original_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means a Party's reasonable efforts and diligence, consistent with professional business standards generally practiced in the health and nutrition industry, applied in accordance with the Party's commercially reasonable business, legal, medical and scientific judgment, including the efforts and resources the Party would use for a product owned by it or to which it has rights, which is of similar market potential at a similar stage in its product life, taking into account the competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position of the compound, the Applicable Laws, the profitability of the applicable products, and other relevant factors including, without limitation, technical, legal, scientific or medical factors.",
                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means a Party's minimal effort and diligence, consistent with basic business standards, applied solely in accordance with the Party's financial judgment, including the minimal resources the Party would use for a low-priority product. The competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position of the compound, the Applicable Laws, and other factors are explicitly excluded.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' includes consideration of several factors like marketplace competitiveness and applicable laws. The modified definition drastically reduces the effort required and excludes key factors that are typically considered, conflicting with the standard legal interpretation of this term and creating uncertainty about the level of effort each party is obligated to provide, and how a court would view that obligation.",

In the event that either Party believes it may be necessary to conduct a recall, field correction, market withdrawal, stock recovery, or other similar action with respect to any Product which was sold under this Agreement (a \"Recall\"), CARDAX and CAPSUGEL shall promptly consult with each other in good faith as to how best to proceed, it being understood and agreed that the final decision as to any Recall of any Product sold by Marketer(s) shall be made jointly; provided, however, that neither Party shall be prohibited hereunder from taking any action that it is required to take by Applicable Law or taking Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate the loss from any Recall or seizure or to protect the public.",
                "changed_text": "6.6 Recall. In the event that either Party subjectively determines a 'potential inconvenience' exists with respect to any Product, the determining Party alone decides on the 'suggested course correction'. Neither Party is obligated to adhere to Applicable Law or use any effort to mitigate loss or protect the public.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a good faith consultation and joint decision on product recalls, with explicit consideration for Applicable Law and Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate loss. The modified text allows a single party to unilaterally decide on recalls based on a subjective 'potential inconvenience', removing the obligation to comply with Applicable Law and protect the public. This directly contradicts established product liability and consumer protection laws, under which a company needs to act in good faith and take responsibility for safety.",

                "original_text": "8.4 Limitation of Damages.  IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. Except in the event of (i) a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct and/or (ii) a Party's breach of its confidentiality obligation, the total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 Limitation of Damages.  Neither Party shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising under or relating to this agreement, regardless of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of confidentiality. Liability shall be capped at $100, regardless of revenues received under this Agreement or applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The original clause limits damages but carves out exceptions for gross negligence, willful misconduct, and breach of confidentiality. It also states that the limitation is 'to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.' The modified clause eliminates these exceptions and imposes a flat $100 liability cap, irrespective of fault or the revenue generated under the agreement. This contradicts fundamental principles of tort law, under which parties can be held liable for damages resulting from their negligence or intentional misconduct, and may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly if it shields a party from liability for egregious behavior.",

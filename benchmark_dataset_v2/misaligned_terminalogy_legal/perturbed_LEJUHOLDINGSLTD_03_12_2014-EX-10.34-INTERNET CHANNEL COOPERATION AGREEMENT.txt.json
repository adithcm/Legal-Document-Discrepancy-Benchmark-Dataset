                "original_text": "Business Secrets mean any technical, financial, commercial or any other information owned and treated as business secrets by one Party and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates, which have the following attributes:\n\n  (i) It is unknown to the public;\n\n  (ii) It may generate economic benefit for its owner;\n\n  (iii) It is practical; and\n\n  (iv) It is treated as business secrets with appropriate protection measures by its owner.",
                "changed_text": "Business Secrets mean any technical, financial, commercial or any other information that one Party considers confidential. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of Business Secrets shall include but not be limited to information that:\n\n  (i) May or may not be known to the public;\n\n  (ii) May or may not generate economic benefit for its owner;\n\n  (iii) May or may not be practical; and\n\n  (iv) May or may not be treated as confidential with or without any protection measures by its owner.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Business Secrets' aligns with the common understanding and legal interpretation of trade secrets, requiring specific attributes like economic benefit and protection measures. The modified definition broadens the scope significantly, allowing a party to designate virtually any information as a 'Business Secret' regardless of its actual confidentiality, economic value, or protective measures. This contradicts established legal standards for trade secret protection, creating uncertainty about which information is truly protected and enforceable under confidentiality obligations.",

                "original_text": "Force Majeure means the occurrence of any acts of God or man-made disasters or accidents during the term of this Agreement which is unforeseeable or, if foreseeable, unavoidable, or uncontrollable and make it impossible for one Party to perform this Agreement in a whole, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, fires, wars, strikes, riots, hacker attacks, technical breakdown of telecommunication departments, and legal restrictions.",
                "changed_text": "Force Majeure means any event that a Party claims prevents it from fully performing its obligations under this Agreement. These events might include, but are not limited to, natural events, labor disputes, or changes in the market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Force Majeure' includes specific, extraordinary events that are generally accepted as grounds for excused performance under contract law. The modified definition is overly broad and subjective, allowing a party to invoke 'Force Majeure' based on vaguely defined events like 'changes in the market conditions.' This creates a significant legal contradiction because it deviates from the traditional and legally recognized understanding of Force Majeure, potentially excusing a party's performance for reasons that would not typically qualify under applicable law. This introduces significant uncertainty in the contract's enforceability.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party A undertakes to promote the key word (including any of the key words relating to real properties, building material products and home furnishing) involved in the Cooperation Channel. Party A warrants that such key word will be promoted on the open search platform of Baidu and preferentially displayed at the left side of the search result pages, the exact display position of which is subject to separate agreement between the Parties. The search results will link to the real estate and home furnishing channel under cooperation of the Parties. The key words will be provided to Party B to Party A, and the information included in any of the key words and their search results will be in compliance with laws and regulations, as well as business rules of Party A, including without limitation user's experience.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Party A may choose to promote keywords related to the Cooperation Channel at its discretion. Party A makes no guarantees regarding the placement or visibility of such keywords, and may alter or remove them without notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear obligation for Party A to promote keywords on Baidu's search platform with preferential display. This obligation is a critical aspect of the agreement, ensuring visibility for the Cooperation Channel. The modified text transforms this obligation into a discretionary option for Party A, removing any guarantee of promotion or visibility. This directly contradicts the original intent and creates legal uncertainty because it allows Party A to effectively negate a key benefit promised to Party B. This could be considered a breach of contract under PRC law, but the discretionary language makes it more difficult to enforce.",

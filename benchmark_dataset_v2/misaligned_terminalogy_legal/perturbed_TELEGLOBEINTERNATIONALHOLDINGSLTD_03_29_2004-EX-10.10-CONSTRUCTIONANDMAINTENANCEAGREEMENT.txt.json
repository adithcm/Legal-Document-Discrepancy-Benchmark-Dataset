                "original_text": "Affiliate: A company is the Affiliate of another if either company owns directly or indirectly less than 50% but no less than 10% of its equity.",
                "changed_text": "Affiliate: A company may be considered an Affiliate of another if there are any existing business relationships.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a clear threshold for affiliation based on equity ownership. The modified definition introduces ambiguity, as 'any existing business relationship' is vague and does not align with standard legal interpretations of affiliation, which often require a degree of control or ownership.",

                "explanation": "The original definition ties allocated capacity directly to financial investment. The modified definition removes this link, making allocation discretionary and potentially conflicting with principles of equity and fairness expected in business agreements.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, the Ready For Service Date (hereinafter referred to as the \"RFS Date\") is an estimate and not a guarantee of service availability.",
                "explanation": "The original definition sets a specific, agreed-upon date for the commencement of commercial service. The modified definition introduces uncertainty by making service placement 'potential' and the date a mere 'estimate,' which contradicts the intent of a firm commitment.",

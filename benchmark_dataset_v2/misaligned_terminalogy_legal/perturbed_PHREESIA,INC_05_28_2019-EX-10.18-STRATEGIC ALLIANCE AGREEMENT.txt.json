                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. Allscripts' Affiliates may exercise Allscripts' rights and fulfill its related obligations under this Agreement, provided that Allscripts shall be responsible for any breach of such obligations by its Affiliates to the same extent as if Allscripts was the breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the direct power to influence the decisions of a Person. Allscripts' Affiliates may exercise Allscripts' rights and fulfill its related obligations under this Agreement, provided that Allscripts shall only be responsible for a portion of such obligations by its Affiliates to the same extent.",
                "explanation": "The term \"control\" is typically defined legally and in business contexts as the power to direct management and policies, not simply to \"influence decisions.\" By changing this, the definition becomes vague and could lead to disputes about what constitutes control, especially since 'influence' is subjective. Additionally, Allscripts' responsibility is lessened from \"any breach of such obligations by its Affiliates to the same extent\" to \"only a portion of such obligations to the same extent.\"",

                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means information of a Disclosing Party, whether public or non-public, [***].",
                "explanation": "Legally, confidential information refers to non-public data that provides a competitive advantage. By changing the definition to include 'whether public or non-public' information, this significantly broadens the scope and includes information that is already available, contradicting the conventional definition of confidential information and potentially hindering the contract's enforceability regarding trade secrets or proprietary data.",

                "changed_text": "\"Law\" means only any federal statute or regulation.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the definition of \"Law\" to only federal statutes or regulations, the clause ignores a substantial body of state and local laws and regulations, as well as common law precedents, treaties, and other legal requirements. This narrowed definition could significantly impact the contract's interpretation and enforcement, especially where state or local laws are applicable, creating uncertainty and potential legal challenges.",

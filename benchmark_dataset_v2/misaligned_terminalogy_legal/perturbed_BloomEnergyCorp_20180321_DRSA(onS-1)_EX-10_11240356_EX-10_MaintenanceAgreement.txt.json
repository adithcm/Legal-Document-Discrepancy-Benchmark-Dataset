                "changed_text": "\"Prudent Electrical Practices\" means those suggestions, methods, equipment, specifications, and standards of safety and performance, as the same may change from time to time, that are preferred by the Operator.",
                "explanation": "The original definition adheres to industry standards and legal requirements, while the modified definition makes 'Prudent Electrical Practices' subjective and controlled solely by the Operator. This introduces ambiguity and conflicts with standard grid operation protocols, potentially violating regulations by allowing the operator's preference to override established safety and performance standards. The original definition is based on standards in United States while the changed is only based on operator preferences.",

It shall include failure or interruption of performance due to: an act of God, civil or military authority, war, civil disturbances, terrorist activities, fire, explosions, the elements, the gas supplier's failure to comply with gas delivery, quality or pressure requirements, the external power delivery system (a/k/a the grid) being out of the required specifications or total failure (a/k/a brownout or blackout), PJM or other electric grid curtailment, or failure of equipment not utilized by or under the control of the Party claiming the Force Majeure Event (or any Affiliate or subcontractor of such Party). Force Majeure Event does not include the lack of economic resources of a Party or Operator's failure to design and construct the Bloom Systems and the BOF so as to meet the respective warranties hereunder.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes specific, unforeseen events beyond a party's control, consistent with legal interpretations of force majeure. The modified definition broadens the scope to include foreseeable events like 'lack of available personnel' or 'economic downturns,' which are typically not considered force majeure under contract law.

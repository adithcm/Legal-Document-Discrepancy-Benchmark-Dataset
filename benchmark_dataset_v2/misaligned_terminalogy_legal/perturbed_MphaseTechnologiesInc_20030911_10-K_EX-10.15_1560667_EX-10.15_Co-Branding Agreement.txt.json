                "original_text": "mPhase agrees to abide by the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of          this Agreement specifying the dimensions, requirements and          specifications, and the review process related to use of the Lucent          Co-Branding Logo. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be          updated from time to time and agrees to abide by those updates as well          as the guidelines provided herein.",
                "changed_text": "mPhase agrees to generally follow the guidelines appearing on Schedule B of this Agreement offering suggestions for dimensions, requirements and specifications related to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo. mPhase is not required to follow these guidelines strictly. mPhase understands that these guidelines may be updated from time to time and while Lucent will notify mPhase of changes, mPhase has no obligation to follow any changed guidelines.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the mandatory nature of the guidelines in Schedule B. Originally, mPhase 'agrees to abide by' the guidelines. The modification changes this to 'generally follow' and explicitly states that mPhase is 'not required to follow these guidelines strictly' or any future updates. This creates ambiguity and contradicts the initial intent of the agreement, potentially leading to disputes over compliance and brand representation.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in Lucent's opinion, may adversely affect the general impression of the Lucent brand, Lucent may upon written notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specified 'sole judgment of Lucent' regarding adverse effects on 'Lucent's rights to the mark'. The modified text changes this to 'Lucent's opinion' regarding the 'general impression of the Lucent brand'. This lowers the threshold for termination and replaces a legally defensible standard (affecting 'rights to the mark') with a more subjective one ('general impression'). This introduces ambiguity and makes the termination clause potentially unenforceable as it relies on a vague criterion.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that \"mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current quality of their Goods.\" This imposes a definite standard of quality, which is the current level. However, the modified version replaces the concrete standard with the ambiguous \"mPhase will attempt to maintain a reasonable quality of its Goods associated with the Lucent Co-Branding Logo.\" It replaces 'agrees to maintain' with 'will attempt to maintain' and replace the 'current quality' with the phrase 'reasonable quality', making it very subjective and creating legal uncertainty.",

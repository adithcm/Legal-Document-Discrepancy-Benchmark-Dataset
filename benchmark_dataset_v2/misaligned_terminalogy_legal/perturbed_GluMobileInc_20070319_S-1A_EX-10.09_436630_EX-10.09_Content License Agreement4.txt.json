                "changed_text": "TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will continue in full force and effect until March 31, 2008, unless earlier terminated at the discretion of Fox.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'unless earlier terminated at the discretion of Fox' introduces a contradiction. While contracts can have termination clauses, giving Fox unfettered discretion to terminate contradicts the 'full force and effect until March 31, 2008' clause. This creates uncertainty and could be viewed as an unenforceable clause under contract law.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'necessarily' to 'ambiguously' increases the chance of misinterpretation of modifications and stating it is under 'revision' creates uncertainty if the contract is binding or not.",

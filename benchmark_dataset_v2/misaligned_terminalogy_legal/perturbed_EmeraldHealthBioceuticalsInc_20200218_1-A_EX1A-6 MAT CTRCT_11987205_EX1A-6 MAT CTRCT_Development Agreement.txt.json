                "original_text": "The Services Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive two-year terms thereafter unless written notice is given by either party to the other, indicating that party's intention not to renew the Services Term of this Agreement, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial Services Term or any renewed Services Term.",
                "changed_text": "The Services Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive two-year terms thereafter unless a suggestion is given by either party to the other, indicating that party's intention not to renew the Services Term of this Agreement, at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the initial Services Term or any renewed Services Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires 'written notice' for non-renewal, a legally recognized standard. The modified text changes this to a 'suggestion,' which lacks legal weight and creates ambiguity. Furthermore, the required notice period was changed from 90 days to 30 days.",

                "changed_text": "Confidential Information: may include proprietary information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how, including, but not limited to, some of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, general research, product plans, certain products, a few services, several suppliers, limited customer lists and potential customers, prices if deemed, markets unless public, inventions already patented, outdated technology, basic formulas, broad specifications, rough designs, sketches, marketing strategies, some licenses, portions of finances, approximate budgets and general business information.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is broad and inclusive. The modified definition introduces uncertainty by using vague qualifiers like 'may include,' 'some,' 'certain,' 'a few,' 'several,' 'limited,' 'potential,' 'if deemed,' 'unless public,' 'already patented,' 'outdated,' 'basic,' 'broad,' 'rough,' 'sketches,' 'some,' 'portions,' 'approximate,' and 'general.'

The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting such mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).",
                "changed_text": "The parties may consider attempting to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement through informal discussions somewhere convenient. Any disputes remaining unresolved after such consideration might potentially be addressed through non-binding arbitration in a location to be mutually determined, possibly following guidelines similar to those of a recognized organization.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates mediation and binding arbitration in Phoenix, Arizona, under AAA rules, providing a clear dispute resolution process. The modified clause replaces these with vague and non-committal language like 'may consider attempting,' 'informal discussions,' 'somewhere convenient,' 'might potentially be addressed,' 'non-binding arbitration,' 'location to be mutually determined,' and 'possibly following guidelines.' This eliminates the mandatory nature of mediation and arbitration, removes the specific location and rules, and makes the entire dispute resolution process uncertain and unenforceable.",

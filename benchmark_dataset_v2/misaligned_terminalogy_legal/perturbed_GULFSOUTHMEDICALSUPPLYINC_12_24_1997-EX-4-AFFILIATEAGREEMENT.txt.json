                "changed_text": "The undersigned understands and agrees that as to GSMS he is considered a 'related party' under internal company policy, and the undersigned anticipates that he will be such a 'related party' at the time of the Merger.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'affiliate' to 'related party' creates a misaligned terminology. While 'affiliate' has a specific legal definition under SEC rules, 'related party' is vague and undefined in this context. This introduces uncertainty regarding the applicability of securities regulations to the undersigned.",

                "original_text": "PSS has informed the undersigned that any distribution by the    undersigned of PSS Common Stock has not been registered under the 1933 Act    and that shares of PSS Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger can only    be sold by the undersigned (1) following registration under the 1933 Act, or    (2) in conformity with the volume and other requirements of Rule 145(d)    promulgated by the SEC as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, or    (3) to the extent some other exemption from registration under the 1933 Act    might be available.",
                "changed_text": "PSS has informed the undersigned that any distribution by the undersigned of PSS Common Stock may or may not be registered under the 1933 Act, and that shares of PSS Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger can be sold by the undersigned at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts securities law by implying that registration is optional and sales can occur without regard to registration requirements or available exemptions. This introduces ambiguity and directly conflicts with the mandatory registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 unless an exemption exists.",

If PSS's counsel concludes that such proposed sale or transfer complies with the requirements of Rule 145(d), PSS shall cause such counsel to provide such opinions as may be necessary to PSS's Transfer Agent so that the undersigned may complete the proposed sale or transfer.",

                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the obligations related to Rule 145(d). The original clause requires the affiliate to provide documentation and relies on PSS's counsel to ensure compliance. The altered clause removes the affiliate's responsibility and absolves PSS from ensuring compliance with Rule 145(d).",

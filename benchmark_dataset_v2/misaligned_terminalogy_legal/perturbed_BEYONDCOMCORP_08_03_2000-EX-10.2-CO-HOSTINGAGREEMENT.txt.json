Those portions of the NAI Internet Site or any future Internet locations developed by NAI which are accessible by members of the general public are referred to herein as the \"Originating Locations.\" NAI permits the maintenance of \"hot links\" from the Originating Locations to other Internet locations, whereby the end user can transfer from the NAI Internet Sites to the Co-Host Site by clicking the pointing device on highlighted text or images. \"Originating Locations\" does not include the McAffee Mall (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\") or web servers within a firewall or accessable only by passwords or other similarly restricted URLs (the \"Restricted Sites\"); provided, however, that the term Restricted Sites shall not include sites accessable only through online services (such as AOL) and other portals generally accessable to the public.",

                "explanation": "The term \"Originating Locations\" which was defined in the original contract has been renamed to \"Public Locations\" and its definition has been altered to create conflict and ambiguity. Originally, \"Originating Locations\" excluded McAfee Mall and restricted sites. The altered definition states \"Public Locations\" shall only include McAfee Mall and restricted URLs, thereby contradicting the intent of the parties.",

During the Term (as defined in Section 6 (a) below), NAI shall      provide the following marketing considerations to Co-Host:\n\n  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-Host shall be permitted to maintain on the           Online Service Page (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\") of the           Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit \"B\" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit \"B\" or as the           parties may mutually agree upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to Internet locations specified by the Co-Host (the           \"Destination\") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods           (hereinafter defined)) may be sold. The web pages at the Destination           shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this           Agreement, including without limitation, Section 2 hereof.           \"Competitor's Goods\" as used herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not contain any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods; provided           that the Destination will link to the Co-Host Site (which will sell           Competitor's Goods).",

                "explanation": "By replacing \"Originating Locations\" with \"Public Locations\" in Section 1(a), we are introducing an inconsistency with the previous definition in the Recitals. The rights granted to Co-Host are now tied to a differently (and contradictorily) defined term. This impacts the scope of the Co-Hosting Rights and introduces ambiguity regarding where the hot link to the Co-Host can be maintained.",

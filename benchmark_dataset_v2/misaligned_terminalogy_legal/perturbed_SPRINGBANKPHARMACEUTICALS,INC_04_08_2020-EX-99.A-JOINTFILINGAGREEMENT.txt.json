                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with loosely interpreted guidance under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the permissive filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states an agreement 'in accordance with Rule 13d-1(k),' implying a mandatory compliance. Modifying it to 'loosely interpreted guidance' and 'permissive filing' directly contradicts the mandatory nature of SEC rules and introduces ambiguity about whether compliance is actually required. This undermines the enforceability of the agreement under securities law.",

                "changed_text": "Each party to the agreement may, at their discretion, authorize another party to file on its behalf any amendments to such statement, contingent upon prior written consent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a significant deviation from standard practice for joint filings. By adding the condition 'at their discretion' and 'contingent upon prior written consent', the original 'expressly authorizes' is weakened. This weakens the agreement and creates doubt whether the authorization is actually binding without explicit approval for each amendment, potentially conflicting with regulations mandating clear delegation of filing responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "Each party to this agreement agrees that this joint filing agreement may be signed in counterparts.",
                "changed_text": "Each party to this agreement acknowledges the possibility of signing separate signature pages, but the validity thereof is subject to unanimous consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for signing in counterparts without conditions, while the changed version introduces a condition of 'unanimous consent' for the validity of such signatures. This creates a potential conflict as standard legal practice accepts counterpart signatures as fully valid. The added condition introduces uncertainty and potential grounds to challenge the agreement's validity based on signature authenticity, deviating from established legal norms.",

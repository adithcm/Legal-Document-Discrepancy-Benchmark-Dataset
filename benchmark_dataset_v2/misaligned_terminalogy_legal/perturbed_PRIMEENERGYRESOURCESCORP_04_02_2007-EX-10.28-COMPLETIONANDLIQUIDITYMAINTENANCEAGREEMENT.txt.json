For purposes ofthis Agreement, Project Completion shall consist oftwo components and be defined as: A) each Project Field in the Development Project having all planned in-field and flow pipelines, caissons, platforms and production facilities for all the wells in such Project Field, for which Guaranty has loaned funds, installed and operationalsuch that the production from all such wells can be transported to a readily available sales point for naturalgas.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, Project Completion shall consist of two components and be defined as: A) each Project Field in the Development Project having some of the in-field and flow pipelines, caissons, platforms and production facilities for some of the wells in such Project Area, for which Guaranty may have loaned funds, partially installed and potentially operational such that some production from some wells could possibly be transported to any potential sales point for some substance.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Project Field' and 'Project Completion' are redefined vaguely. The original agreement intended that all planned infrastructure be complete and operational for all wells to be considered a Project Completion. By changing this definition, the ambiguity affects the obligations of Prime Energy under the agreement, specifically in regards to funding requirements.",

                "changed_text": "Prime will, during the term of the Credit Agreement, attempt to maintain some liquidity, potentially including some revolver availability under any credit agreement, and/or some cash which may or may not be restricted, of approximately $25,000,000.",
                "explanation": "The requirement for maintaining $25,000,000 in liquidity is weakened by using vague terms such as 'attempt to maintain some liquidity,' 'some revolver availability,' 'some cash which may or may not be restricted' and 'approximately.' This introduces uncertainty about the actual liquidity Prime is required to maintain.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in force until all possible components of whatever anyone considers Project Completion could be satisfied.",
                "explanation": "The original contract says the contract will remain in force until 'each component of Project Completion is satisfied'. The new contract language replaces 'each' with 'all possible' and replaces the definition of what would qualify as Project Completion. This creates confusion as to what specifically would constitute the triggering event for the end of the agreement, making the enforcement of Prime's obligations unclear.",

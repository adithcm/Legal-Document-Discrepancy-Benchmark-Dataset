                "original_text": "1.9 Commercially Reasonable Efforts means, with respect to the efforts to be used by a Party under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Products, those efforts and resources normally used by a major pharmaceutical or a sufficiently financed biotechnology company for a product owned by it, or to which it has rights, which is of similar market potential at comparable stages of development, taking into account the competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position of the product, the performance of other products that are of similar market potential and the likely timing of other product's entry into the market, the regulatory structure involved, the profitability of the applicable product, relevant Third Party intellectual property necessary to manufacture or Commercialize the Licensed Product and other relevant factors commonly considered in similar circumstances, including technical, legal, scientific or medical factors.",
                "changed_text": "1.9 Commercially Reasonable Efforts means, with respect to the efforts to be used by a Party under this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Products, those efforts and resources deemed adequate at the sole discretion of the Party for a product owned by it, or to which it has rights, regardless of market potential or stage of development. The Party's internal assessment shall be the sole determinant of adequate effort.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' includes objective benchmarks and considerations, aligning with the common legal understanding of the term. The modified definition makes the term entirely subjective and discretionary, negating any obligation to act reasonably from a commercial standpoint. This creates a legal contradiction and uncertainty in enforcement, because the term is now reliant on the company's sole discretion.",

For clarity, Commercialization does not include any Development activities, whether conducted before or after Regulatory Approval. \"Commercialize\" and \"Commercializing\" have correlative meanings.",
                "changed_text": "1.10 Commercialization means preliminary discussions regarding potential market entry. This is limited to informal talks and does not include any concrete steps toward promotion, marketing, sale, or distribution. 'Commercialize' and 'Commercializing' refer solely to these preliminary discussions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition included concrete steps for introducing and selling a pharmaceutical product, consistent with standard business and legal understanding. The modified definition severely restricts the meaning of 'Commercialization,' excluding all substantive activities. This contradicts the common and legally understood meaning of the term, creating confusion and rendering clauses dependent on it potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes a broad range of intellectual property rights, including both registered and unregistered rights like trade secrets. The modified definition limits 'Intellectual Property Rights' to only registered rights. This contradicts the established legal understanding that intellectual property includes unregistered rights, potentially impacting patent rights or the use of trademarks.",

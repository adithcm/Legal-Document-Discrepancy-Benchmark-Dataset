                "explanation": "The definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' is being changed from an objective standard ('that level of efforts and resources') to a subjective one ('that level of efforts and resources the Party deems fit').

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Control' is changed from 'possession by a Party of the ability' to 'influence by a Party of the ability'. This introduces a weaker standard that creates uncertainty regarding the extent of control required, which can lead to disputes over obligations related to intellectual property rights and data access.

                "explanation": "The non-compete covenant has been modified by adding a subjective disagreement clause in the sentence, 'if they disagree with Zogenix'. This introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original intent of a strict non-compete agreement. It is unclear when disagreement counts to overrule the non-compete.

                "original_text": "WHEREAS, NeuroBo wishes that Dong-A manufacture and supply to NeuroBo the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and their matching placebo for the purpose of research and development of the Licensed Products, including the use in phase III clinical trials to be conducted by NeuroBo for the purpose of obtaining the NDA in the Territory, pursuant to the License Agreement;",
                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, NeuroBo desires that Dong-A manufacture and supply to NeuroBo the requested quantity of the Licensed Products and their matching placebo for the purpose of research and development of the Licensed Products, including use in phase III clinical trials conducted by NeuroBo for NDA application in the Territory, as per the License Agreement;",
                "explanation": "The change from 'entire requirement' to 'requested quantity' introduces ambiguity, contradicting the implicit understanding of a comprehensive supply agreement. This could lead to disputes over whether Dong-A is obligated to meet all of NeuroBo's demands or just the explicitly ordered amounts. Also, using NDA application is non-standard as opposed to the original wording of NDA in the territory.",

                "original_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A shall (i) supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already manufactured by Dong-A as of the Effective Date in compliance with the KGMP, and (ii) manufacture in compliance with the KGMP and in conformity with the specifications separately agreed upon between the Parties and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the \"Product Specifications\") and supply to NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo shall purchase from Dong-A the entire requirement of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development of the Licensed Products under the License Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "2.1 Subject to the provisions hereof, Dong-A will (i) furnish NeuroBo the Licensed Products and their matching placebo already produced by Dong-A as of the Effective Date under the KGMP guidelines, and (ii) produce according to the KGMP guidelines and conforming to the specs agreed upon between the Parties in Exhibit A (the \"Product Specifications\") and furnish NeuroBo the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, and NeuroBo will procure from Dong-A the required Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for research and development under the License Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'supply' to 'furnish' and 'purchase' to 'procure' subtly weakens the contractual obligation. The change from 'shall' to 'will' makes the obligation less binding. Also, the change from 'entire requirement' to 'required' further creates uncertainty about quantity commitments, making the agreement less enforceable. Also, the term 'in compliance with' was replaced with 'under' and 'according to' which has less legal weight.",

For each order, NeuroBo shall be obligated to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 NeuroBo should aim to give Dong-A an indication for Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo around [***] days before the desired delivery date. For each indication, NeuroBo should try to give an estimate of Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall submit an order' to 'should aim to give an indication' and 'shall be obligated to order' to 'should try to give an estimate' makes the ordering process discretionary rather than mandatory. This weakens the enforceability of the ordering terms, creating a misalignment with standard contract law practices that require clear obligations. Also, the original text uses standard legal terminology, whereas the modified text uses language with different meanings.",

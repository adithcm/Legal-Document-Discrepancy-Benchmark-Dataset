                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Know-How\" specifically includes \"trade secrets, and other confidential and proprietary information.\" This change redefines it to include \"generally known information, public knowledge, common knowledge\" which directly contradicts the legal understanding of trade secrets and confidential information. The addition of those terms to the list makes the enforcement of the Know-How license uncertain. Trade secrets are defined under state and federal law as information that is kept secret and provides a competitive advantage. Including publicly available information negates the protected status of trade secrets.",

                "explanation": "The change from a \"perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license\" to a \"temporary, exclusive, royalty-based license\" introduces legal contradiction. Copyright licenses have well-defined characteristics under copyright law. 'Perpetual' means forever, and 'temporary' means of a limited duration, creating uncertainty about the duration of the license. 'Non-exclusive' allows the licensor to grant similar licenses to others, while 'exclusive' prevents it, contradicting the fundamental nature of the original license. 'Royalty-free' means no payment is required, whereas 'royalty-based' mandates payment. The modification will create uncertainty in the understanding of the contract.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the standard legal understanding of indemnification. 'Indemnify, defend, and hold harmless' is a standard clause that creates a clear obligation. By changing 'agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless' to 'agrees to maybe indemnify, but not defend or hold harmless' makes the obligation optional and uncertain. The exclusion of costs, liabilities, claims, and expenses severely limits the scope of indemnification. Furthermore, indemnifying for 'reasonable action' or 'ordinary negligence' contradicts legal norms, as indemnification typically covers wrongful acts, not reasonable or accidental ones.",

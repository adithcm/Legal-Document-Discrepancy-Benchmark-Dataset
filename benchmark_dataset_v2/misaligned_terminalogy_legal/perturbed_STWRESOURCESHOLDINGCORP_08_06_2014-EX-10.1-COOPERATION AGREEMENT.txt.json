                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, the City of Fort Stockton, Texas (\"COFS\") claims ownership of the surface and groundwater rights to several areas of the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation; and",
                "explanation": "Changing \"owns\" to \"claims ownership\" introduces ambiguity regarding the actual legal standing of COFS's rights. In Texas, groundwater rights are subject to the Rule of Capture and regulatory limitations. This change conflicts with the presumption of clear ownership, creating uncertainty about COFS's authority to lease those rights.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "COFS hereby grants, leases and lets unto STW the right to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\").",
                "changed_text": "COFS hereby grants, licenses and allows STW the privilege to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\").",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'leases' with 'licenses' and 'lets unto' with 'allows the privilege' significantly weakens STW's rights. A lease grants a property interest, whereas a license is a mere permission that can be revoked. This contradicts the implied intent of a long-term cooperation agreement to secure water rights, making the agreement's enforceability questionable.",

                "original_text": "The Post-Well Study shall provide information on the feasibility of developing a water well field in that location that would produce water from the CRA for: (a) the availability of a minimum 1,200 gallons per minute (\"GPM\") per day CRA water production for STW, its successors or assignees, to sell to communities and users within a 500-mile radius outside of COFS (the \"Permitted Sale Water\") during the Term, with the further requirement that STW would be responsible for the pipelines and pumping facilities required to transport the Permitted Sale Water to the intended end-users; and that all such water obtained from the Existing CRA Well contains acceptable levels of Total Dissolved Solids (\"TDS\") to meet municipal use standards.",
                "changed_text": "The Post-Well Study shall provide non-binding estimates on the potential of developing a water well field in that location, potentially allowing water production from the CRA. This includes (a) a hypothetical estimate of 1,200 gallons per minute (\"GPM\") per day CRA water production for STW, its successors or assignees, to consider selling to communities and users within a 500-mile radius outside of COFS (the \"Possible Sale Water\") during the Term, with a suggestion that STW may be responsible for the pipelines and pumping facilities to transport this water; and a qualitative assessment of water quality from the Existing CRA Well, regardless of Total Dissolved Solids (\"TDS\") levels.",
                "explanation": "Changing the mandatory feasibility study into non-binding estimates, replacing \"Permitted Sale Water\" with \"Possible Sale Water,\" implying rather than requiring STW to build pipelines, and disregarding TDS levels introduces multiple points of legal contradiction. Water rights and sales are heavily regulated, and this change weakens the legal commitment to produce and sell water meeting specific standards, undermining the core purpose of the agreement.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Terpene Product\" means terpene from citrus with a minimum d-limonene content of 94%, with the specifications set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"Terpene Product\" means any liquid derived from citrus, regardless of d-limonene content or the specifications in Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a minimum d-limonene content and adherence to Exhibit A. The modified definition broadens the term to include any citrus-derived liquid, conflicting with the original, stricter definition and potentially encompassing substances not intended to be covered by the agreement. This creates uncertainty regarding the product's composition and quality, impacting the contract's enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "Transportation may be arranged by either Flotek or FCC at their convenience. The applicability of Exhibit B's terms to sales of Terpene Product shall be at the seller's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly mandates that Flotek arranges transportation and binds all sales to Exhibit B. The modification introduces ambiguity by making transportation arrangement optional and Exhibit B's application discretionary, which could cause disputes over delivery responsibilities and the governing terms of sale. This impacts the clarity and enforceability of these provisions.",

                "changed_text": "FCC will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Flotek, its Affiliates, and their respective officers and employees from all claims, actions, losses, damages and expenses resulting from any injury to persons, damage to property or action by any regulatory agency, arising out of or in any way associated with the operation of the Facility or any other facility of FCC, including, without limitation, injuries to FCC's employees involved in these operations ONLY IN CASES WHERE FCC IS SOLELY NEGLIGENT.",
                "explanation": "The original indemnity clause specifically states it applies REGARDLESS of the negligence of the indemnified parties (Flotek, etc.). The modification restricts this to ONLY cases where FCC is SOLELY negligent, directly contradicting the original intent and significantly limiting the scope of indemnification. This creates uncertainty about liability allocation, impacting the contract's risk distribution and enforceability.",

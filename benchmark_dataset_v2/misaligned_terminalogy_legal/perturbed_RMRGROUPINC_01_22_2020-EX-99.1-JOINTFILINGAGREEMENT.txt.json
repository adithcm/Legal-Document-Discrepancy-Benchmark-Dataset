                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be' to 'may be' and adding that filings are at the discretion of the party, the agreement now contradicts the mandatory filing requirements under Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This introduces uncertainty as to whether all parties are obligated to jointly file, which is required under the rule for certain ownership thresholds and agreements.",

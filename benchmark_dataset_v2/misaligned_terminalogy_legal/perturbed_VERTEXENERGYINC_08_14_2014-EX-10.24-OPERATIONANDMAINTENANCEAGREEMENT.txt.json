                "original_text": "2.2 Independent Contractor. The Parties expressly understand and agree that Operator is acting and shall perform and execute the provisions of this Agreement as an independent contractor unrelated to Owner or any Owner Affiliate, and the work performed by Operator hereunder shall be subject to Owner's general right of inspection and approval. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a relationship, expressed or implied, of employer-employee or principal-agent between Owner and Operator or between Owner and any individual employed or provided to work hereunder by Operator.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 Independent Contractor. The Parties expressly understand and agree that Operator is acting and shall perform and execute the provisions of this Agreement as an outsourced service provider unrelated to Owner or any Owner Affiliate, and the work performed by Operator hereunder shall be subject to Owner's direct management and control. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a relationship, expressed or implied, of employer-employee or principal-agent between Owner and Operator or between Owner and any individual employed or provided to work hereunder by Operator.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies that the Operator is an \"independent contractor\", but this has been changed to \"outsourced service provider\" and \"direct management and control\", which directly contradicts the legal understanding of what an independent contractor is. It creates confusion as to whether the operator truly has independence as the terms are defined differently under labor and tax laws.",

                "changed_text": "4.1.7 Environmental Laws. Operator shall adhere, in the performance of its duties and responsibilities hereunder, to its interpretation of applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits.",
                "explanation": "The original text says that the Operator shall comply with all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, but it has been changed to adhere to 'its interpretation' of these laws and permits, which is a misaligned term. Environmental laws are compulsory and must be followed according to their statutory meaning. The Operator's interpretation may vary from the legal meaning, and this contradiction creates uncertainty over whether the Rail Facility will truly be compliant.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies the governing law as the laws of Delaware, but this was changed to the 'principles of equity and fairness' with consideration to Louisiana business practices. Contract law is based on statutory and case law, not vague principles of equity. This contradiction makes the enforcement of the contract unpredictable and contradicts standard legal practices.",

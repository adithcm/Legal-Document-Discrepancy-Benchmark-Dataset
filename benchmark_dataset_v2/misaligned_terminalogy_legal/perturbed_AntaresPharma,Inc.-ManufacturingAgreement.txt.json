                "changed_text": "\"cGMP\" means generally accepted manufacturing suggestions and guidelines that both parties agree to follow, with best efforts made towards adhering to the \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations\" of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (21CFR§4; 21CFR§210/211 and 21CFR§820) and in European Community Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices. These are not strict requirements but rather benchmarks for quality control.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly ties cGMP to specific, legally defined standards. The modified version weakens this by changing 'means' to a suggestion and adding the phrase, 'These are not strict requirements but rather benchmarks for quality control.' This contradicts the force of law behind cGMP regulations.",

                "original_text": "\"Recall\" means any action (i) by AMAG to recover title to or possession of quantities of the Products, sample Products and/or Trainers sold or shipped to third parties (including, without limitation, the voluntary withdrawal of Products, sample Products and/or Trainers) from the market); or (ii) by any Regulatory Authorities to detain or destroy any of the Products and/or the sample Products. Recall shall also include any action by either Party to refrain from selling or shipping quantities of the Products, sample Products and/or Trainers to third parties which would have been subject to a Recall if sold or shipped",
                "changed_text": "\"Recall\" means an optional action by AMAG, based on market conditions, to possibly recover Products, sample Products and/or Trainers. Recalls are not mandatory unless AMAG determines it is beneficial for public relations.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with the standard regulatory understanding of a recall as a safety-driven action. The modified version makes it optional and ties it to 'public relations,' directly contradicting the mandatory nature of recalls when safety issues are identified.",

AMAG, its agent or its permitted subcontractor shall conduct all such testing in accordance with the procedures and using the analytical testing methodologies set forth in the Specifications, the Quality Agreement and Applicable Laws",

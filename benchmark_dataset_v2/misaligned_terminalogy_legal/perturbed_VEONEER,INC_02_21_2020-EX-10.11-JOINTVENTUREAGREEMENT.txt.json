                "changed_text": "This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the principles of international business conduct.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'laws of Japan' with 'principles of international business conduct' introduces ambiguity. While international principles exist, they are not as concrete or legally binding as a specific nation's laws. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as it's unclear which specific 'principles' would apply and how they would be interpreted by a court.",

                "original_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement with respect to the indemnification or reimbursement, as applicable, of all Directors and Officers (except those individuals resigning pursuant to Section 6.2.6 of the VNBJ SPA and Section 6.2.6 of the VNBZ SPA) with respect to any Liabilities arising prior to the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing, as applicable.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Article 1.1, Article 1.2 and Article 1.3 above, the Nissin Parties may, at their discretion, consider requests from VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the JV Agreement regarding potential discretionary payments to select Directors and Officers regarding certain issues which may have occurred before the VNBJ Closing or the VNBZ Closing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates compliance with indemnification and reimbursement obligations for Directors and Officers. The changed text makes compliance discretionary and replaces defined terms ('indemnification or reimbursement', 'Liabilities') with vague language ('potential discretionary payments', 'certain issues'), significantly weakening the protection for D&Os and contradicting the original intent to ensure their protection before closing. The term 'discretionary payments' is vague and does not have an accepted legal definition, whereas 'indemnification' has an accepted legal definition and is used in most states.",

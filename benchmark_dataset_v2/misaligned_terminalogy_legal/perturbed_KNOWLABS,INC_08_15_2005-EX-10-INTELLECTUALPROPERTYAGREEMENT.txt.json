                "explanation": "The term 'employment' is changed to 'association,' which is more ambiguous and could be interpreted to include periods beyond formal employment, making the scope of 'Work Product' ownership unclear. Replacing 'foreseeable' with 'conceivable' broadens the scope to any business imaginable, not just reasonably anticipated ones. Furthermore, 'work' is changed to 'tasks', and 'premises' is changed to 'main premises'. These changes make the definition of 'Work Product' overly broad and ambiguous, contradicting standard interpretations related to intellectual property ownership derived from employment.",

Turpin does hereby\n      assign and transfer to the Company,  effective  upon  creation,  all right,\n      title, and interest that Turpin may have in and to the Work Product and all\n      Intellectual Property Rights therein and does hereby assign all of Turpin's\n      future right,  title,  and interest that Turpin may have in and to each of\n      the Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights therein, effective at the\n      time each is created.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that assignment of the work is done upon creation. This text is now altered to be 'after intellectual property has been filed' and 'during the intellectual property review time'. This contradicts the initial automatic assignment clause, creating uncertainty about when intellectual property rights effectively transfer.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates that Turpin 'shall' assist, implying a mandatory obligation. The modified text changes this to 'may, based on his availability' indicating a discretionary action, making the contractual obligation unenforceable. Also, it modifies the sentence: 'without additional compensation, to enable the Company or its nominees to apply for, acquire' to 'without additional compensation if the employee finds it valuable enough, to enable the Company or its nominees to apply for, acquire' creating further ambiguity.",

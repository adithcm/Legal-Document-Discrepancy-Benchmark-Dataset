                "explanation": "By changing 'duly authorized to conduct its business and own its property' to 'authorized to conduct some business and own some property' and 'all licenses' to 'some licenses,' the contract introduces ambiguity about the scope of the bank's authorization and compliance. Federal regulations for banks require full authorization and comprehensive licensing for all aspects of their operations, not just 'some'.",

                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a direct contradiction to established FDIC insurance requirements.  The statement 'may be insured by an insurer or not' defies the mandatory insurance coverage stipulated by the FDIC for deposit accounts in banks.  The removal of 'qualified' before 'thrift lender' and 'within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. §l467a(m)' after, the meaning becomes undefined.",

Deleting \"except that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading)\" means now the Agreement can be canceled even if there is an imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading which are expected.",

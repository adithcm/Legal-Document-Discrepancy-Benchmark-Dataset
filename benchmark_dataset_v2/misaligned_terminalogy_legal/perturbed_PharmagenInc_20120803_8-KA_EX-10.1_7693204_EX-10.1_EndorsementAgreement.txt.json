                "explanation": "Changing 'multivitamin' to 'similar dietary supplement' broadens the scope in a way that is undefined and contradictory under generally accepted understanding of 'multivitamin'. A multivitamin has a clear and precise definition, whereas 'similar dietary supplement' is extremely vague, creating potential for disputes about what constitutes a violation of the exclusivity clause.",

                "changed_text": "HDS agrees to provide and maintain at its own expense, the following insurance coverages: A.

The Celebrity shall be covered under coverages A, B and C. HDS will endeavor to provide Celebrity's agent, CSE, with evidence of insurance.",
                "explanation": "Changing the insurance types to vague descriptions like 'Standard Business Liability' and removing the specific 'per occurrence and aggregate' limits contradicts standard insurance definitions. Also, replacing a defined timeframe of 30 days' notice with an undefined 'endeavor' introduces uncertainty and weakens Celebrity's protection.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractors in all respects' to 'may operate with some degree of independence' fundamentally alters the defined relationship between the parties. The term 'independent contractor' has legal significance, particularly regarding liability and tax obligations. The modified term 'may operate with some degree of independence' lacks this defined legal standing and implies a level of control that could blur the line with employer-employee relationships, particularly when combined with the modifier on the obligate term. This creates legal uncertainty.",

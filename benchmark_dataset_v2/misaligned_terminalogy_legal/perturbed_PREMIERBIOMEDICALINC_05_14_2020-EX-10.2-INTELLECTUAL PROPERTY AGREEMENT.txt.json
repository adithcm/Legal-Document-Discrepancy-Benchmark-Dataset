                "original_text": "Applications. Defines as all applications of the United States and foreign countries, including Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that claim priority to the Applications listed in Appendix A, including any non-provisional applications, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof; and all applications including those applications filed in the United States or applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on subject matter directly related to the Applications in Appendix A whether or not priority to said applications was claimed.",
                "changed_text": "Applications. Defined as a list of United States patent filings, including those claiming priority to applications in Appendix A, continuations and divisions thereof. Foreign filings or applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty are specifically excluded from this definition, even if related to the Applications in Appendix A.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts established patent law and common practice. The original definition broadly included all related patent applications, as is standard. The altered definition now excludes foreign patent applications and PCT applications, even if they claim priority to the listed applications, which is inconsistent with international patent treaties and could severely limit the scope of licensed intellectual property.",

Licensed Product that is sold, leased or put into use by the THI or any Related Companies in the preceding calendar quarter; and\nb. any service performed by THI or any of its Related Companies that directly or indirectly uses Licensed Product.",

Licensed Product that is sold, leased or put into use by the THI or any Related Companies in the preceding calendar quarter; and\nb. any service performed by THI or any of its Related Companies that directly or indirectly uses Licensed Product.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Fair Market Value' was replaced with 'Suggested Retail Price'. Fair Market Value has a specific meaning rooted in actual transactions between willing parties. Suggested Retail Price is an arbitrary number determined by the seller that does not necessarily reflect the actual value of the product, and can be inflated, reducing royalty payments and therefore creating a contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "\"Fair Market Value\" means, with respect to any Licensed Product sold, leased or put into use, an arbitrary price determined by THI's Chief Executive Officer. This price may or may not reflect the actual selling price or any market conditions and shall be determined at the sole discretion of the THI CEO.",
                "explanation": "This change completely negates the standard legal and financial definition of \"Fair Market Value,\" which is based on objective market conditions and \"arm's length\" transactions. Instead, the definition is changed to an arbitrary value set by the THI CEO. This directly contradicts the accepted meaning of the term and introduces ambiguity and uncertainty in the contract, making the royalty calculation completely subjective.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Developer is undertaking the services set forth in this Agreement as an independent contractor, working at Developer's own hours and using Developer's own equipment and at Developer's own chosen place of work, with discretion concerning the revision of Services and Deliverables within Client's general direction. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to constitute the Parties as partners, employees, agents or joint ventures of each other.",
                "changed_text": "Developer is undertaking the services set forth in this Agreement as a contractor, working with some flexibility in hours but primarily adhering to Client's schedules, potentially using Developer's own equipment but possibly using Client-provided resources, and working at a location determined by project needs, with limited discretion concerning the revision of Services and Deliverables beyond Client's explicit instructions. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to constitute the Parties as partners, employees, agents or joint ventures of each other.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'independent contractor' to 'contractor' and altering the description of the working relationship, we introduce ambiguity. The original clause clearly defines an independent contractor relationship, which has specific legal implications under employment and tax laws. The modified text blurs the lines, suggesting a relationship that could be construed as employee-like depending on the level of control exerted by the client. This contradicts the intended independent contractor status.",

                "original_text": "Client shall provide Developer assistance to complete the Services, and produce the Deliverables, as reasonably requested, including but not limited to providing the necessary information or documentation required from Developer for the development of the Subject Program.",
                "changed_text": "Client may provide Developer assistance to complete the Services, and produce the Deliverables, as deemed necessary, including only information or documentation readily available. Client’s assistance is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "By changing “shall provide” to “may provide” and limiting the assistance to readily available information, this contradicts the original intent and creates uncertainty. The original text implies a duty on the client to assist the developer. The modified text suggests the client has discretion and may not provide the level of assistance needed, which can create legal problems if the lack of assistance prevents the developer from fulfilling the contract.",

                "changed_text": "Confidential Information may become shared property based on the level of collaboration, and Derivatives thereof, whether created by Client or Developer, may be subject to shared ownership depending on contributions.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that Confidential Information and its Derivatives remain the property of the Disclosing Party. The modified text introduces the possibility of shared ownership, contradicting the definition of 'Confidential Information' as understood legally and eroding its protection. This creates a significant conflict regarding intellectual property rights and trade secret protection.",

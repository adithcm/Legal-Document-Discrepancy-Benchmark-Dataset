                "original_text": "ENDORSEMENT shall include only the right to use the name, any nickname, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, portrait, likeness, and/or endorsement of Nantz.",
                "changed_text": "ENDORSEMENT shall mean the discretionary use of Nantz's name, nickname, initials, autograph, facsimile signature, photograph, portrait, and likeness, subject to Ashworth's final approval, for marketing purposes.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'ENDORSEMENT' is precise and encompasses specific elements. The modified definition introduces discretion and requires Ashworth's approval, conflicting with standard endorsement agreements where the endorser typically retains control over their image and likeness. This contradicts typical endorsement agreement structures.",

                "explanation": "This statement now creates ambiguity by designating Nantz as a “part-time consultant” while simultaneously being a “full-time employee for convenience”. This contradicts established labor laws that distinguish between employees and consultants based on factors like control, benefits, and integration into the company. This misalignment causes confusion about his true employment status and applicable legal protections.",

                "changed_text": "ARBITRATION Unless otherwise agreed, the Company may elect to pursue arbitration or litigation at its sole discretion. If arbitration is chosen, the rules of an arbitrator selected by the Company will apply.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration under AAA rules unless all parties agree otherwise. The changed text allows the Company to unilaterally decide between arbitration and litigation and to select the arbitrator, which can contradict the principles of fair and neutral arbitration and may render the arbitration clause unenforceable.",

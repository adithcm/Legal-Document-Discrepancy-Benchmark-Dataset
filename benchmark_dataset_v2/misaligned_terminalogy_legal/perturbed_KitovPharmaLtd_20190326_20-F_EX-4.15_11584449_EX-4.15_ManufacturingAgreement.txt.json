                "original_text": "1.17 \"Force Majeure\" shall mean an event beyond a Party's reasonable control which prevents such Party from performing its obligations hereunder, such events may include, but not be limited to, Acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster), war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities, any extraordinary military operation which requires a large military reserve mobilization, nationalization, governmental activities relating to emergency situations, blockage, embargo, strikes or lockouts.",
                "changed_text": "1.17 \"Force Majeure\" shall mean an event that a Party deems to be beyond its control. Such events may include, but are not limited to, minor inconveniences, Acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster), war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities, any extraordinary military operation which requires a large military reserve mobilization, nationalization, governmental activities relating to emergency situations, blockage, embargo, strikes or lockouts.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Force Majeure aligns with standard legal interpretations. By changing \"beyond a Party's reasonable control\" to \"a Party deems to be beyond its control,\" the definition becomes subjective and allows a party to potentially claim Force Majeure for trivial reasons, conflicting with established legal precedent regarding the threshold for invoking such clauses. Adding \"minor inconveniences\" drastically broadens the scope of force majeure to include trivial events.",

                "changed_text": "1.35 \"Specifications\" shall mean guidelines or recommendations for the Product. Specifications are subject to change or alteration at the sole discretion of Dexcel, without notice or regard to the relevant Health Authorities.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Specifications' to established, regulated standards (Marketing Authorization, Health Authorities). The modified definition makes 'Specifications' arbitrary and subject to Dexcel's unilateral change, disregarding regulatory oversight. This conflicts with pharmaceutical regulations that mandate adherence to approved specifications to ensure product safety and efficacy.",

                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the obligation of Dexcel to comply with Product Specifications, Marketing Authorization, cGMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) and Quality Agreement. By stating Dexcel will \"attempt\" to supply and describing adherence as \"aspirational\", the change introduces ambiguity and undermines the regulatory requirement for pharmaceutical manufacturing, potentially violating standards set by the FDA and EMA.",

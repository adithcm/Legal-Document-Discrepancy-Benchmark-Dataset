                "original_text": "\"Intellectual Property\" means the rights associated with or arising out of any of the following in any jurisdiction throughout the world: (i) all patents and patent applications, together with all reissuances, divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, revisions, renewals, extensions, and reexaminations thereof, and any identified invention disclosures (\"Patents\"); (ii) trade secret rights and corresponding rights in confidential information and other non-public information (whether or not patentable), including ideas, formulas, compositions, inventor's notes, discoveries and improvements, know how, manufacturing and production processes and techniques, design manuals, testing information (including testing protocols and results), research and development information, prototypes, inventions, invention disclosures, unpatented blueprints, drawings, specifications, designs, plans, proposals and technical data, business and marketing plans, market surveys, market know-how and customer lists and information, including all tangible embodiments of the foregoing and unregistered copyrights (\"Know-How\"); (iii) all registered or unregistered copyrights, copyrightable works, rights in databases, data collections, \"moral\" rights, mask works, copyright registrations, applications and extensions therefor and corresponding rights in works of authorship (\"Copyrights\"); (iv) all trademarks, service marks, logos, trade dress and trade names indicating the source of goods or services, and other indicia of commercial source or origin (whether registered, common law, statutory or otherwise), all registrations and applications to register the foregoing anywhere in the world and all goodwill associated therewith (\"Trademarks\"); (v) all computer software and code, including assemblers, applets, compilers, source code, object code, development tools, design tools, utilities, library files, user interfaces and data, and all documentation and manuals related to such computer software and code in any form or format, however fixed (\"Software\"); (vi) all internet electronic addresses, uniform resource locators and alphanumeric designations associated therewith and all registrations for any of the foregoing (\"Domain Names\"); and (vii) any similar, corresponding or equivalent rights to any of the foregoing anywhere in the world.",
                "changed_text": "\"Intellectual Property\" means what the Parties consider intellectual property to be, as determined at their sole discretion. This may include, but is not limited to: (i) patents and patent applications, but only those the Parties mutually agree upon; (ii) trade secrets, if they are explicitly documented as such; (iii) copyrights, but only those formally registered with the US Copyright Office; (iv) trademarks that are actively used and defended by the owner; (v) software, only if it's open source; (vi) Domain Names, only if both Parties acknowledge them; and (vii) other rights as the Parties may periodically decide.\"",
                "explanation": "This significantly narrows and alters the definition of 'Intellectual Property' compared to its broad legal definition, creating potential conflicts. The original definition includes a wide range of items and automatic rights, while the revised definition requires mutual agreement, documentation, or formal registration, contradicting standard IP law.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"covenants not to sue\" with \"considers, but does not guarantee, not to sue\" and removing the extension of the covenant to assignees weakens the legal protection against infringement lawsuits. It introduces uncertainty regarding the enforceability of the covenant, deviating from standard contract law principles of definite obligations. It also removes the guarantee that the obligation would extend to Third Parties.",

                "original_text": "Any Study Drug provided by Adaptimmune will be used solely for the applicable Study and solely in accordance with the Protocol or workscope for the relevant Study. MD Anderson will not use such Study Drug outside of the scope of the Study. MD Anderson will not transfer or provide unsupervised access to the Study Drug to any third party for any purpose, without the prior written consent of Adaptimmune.",
                "changed_text": "Any Study Drug provided by Adaptimmune will be used at the discretion of MD Anderson's research team. MD Anderson may use such Study Drug outside of the initially defined scope, contingent upon internal review. MD Anderson may transfer or provide access to the Study Drug to affiliated researchers and collaborating institutions without needing explicit consent from Adaptimmune.",
                "explanation": "The altered language gives MD Anderson broad discretion over the Study Drug's use, contradicting the initial intent of controlled usage and potentially violating federal regulations governing experimental drug distribution and use. This introduces a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "Each Party will retain all right, title and interest in and to its own Background IP and no license to use such Background IP is granted to the other party except for MD Anderson's use of Study Drug in a Study as set forth in Section 3.2 above and in the Protocol and each Party's use of the other Party's Proprietary Material as set forth in Section 3.3 above. \"Background IP\" means all intellectual property (including rights in Confidential Information) of a Party that: (a) was generated by such Party before the Effective Date; (b) is generated by such Party outside the scope or after expiration of this Agreement or any Study under this Agreement; and in each such case; (c) is owned by such Party, either partially or wholly, or is licensed to, or otherwise controlled by such Party, and which is not an Invention under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will retain all right, title and interest in and to its own Background IP; however, access to background intellectual property can be obtained through collaborative agreement, bypassing standard licensing procedures, unless explicitly restricted by the owning party's internal policies. \"Background IP\" loosely refers to general knowledge and expertise, including intellectual property of a Party that: (a) was part of the public domain before the Effective Date; (b) is generally known in the field of study; and (c) is understood to be controlled by such Party.",
                "explanation": "The modification redefines \"Background IP\" to include items in the public domain and alters the licensing terms. It suggests that access to IP can be granted informally which contradicts established IP law, creating ambiguity and potential unenforceability.",

                "changed_text": "While publication of research results is generally favored, Adaptimmune retains the exclusive right to determine the final content and timing of all publications related to the Study; MD Anderson may only publish with Adaptimmune's explicit permission.",
                "explanation": "This change gives Adaptimmune complete control over publications, effectively negating MD Anderson's academic freedom and contradicting the standard practices that allow researchers to disseminate findings. This creates a legal contradiction with principles of academic freedom and the implied rights of research institutions.",

                "original_text": "it will notify the Sponsor promptly in writing of the full particulars of any material change, whether actual, anticipated or threatened, in any material fact stated or referred to in the Prospectus or which would result in an omission from the Prospectus to state a material fact necessary to make any statement contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it is made",
                "changed_text": "it will notify the Sponsor when the Issuer deems it reasonably necessary regarding changes or omissions to a material fact stated or referred to in the Prospectus or which would result in an omission from the Prospectus to state a material fact necessary to make any statement contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it is made",
                "explanation": "The original text requires prompt notification of any material change. The modified text changes the language to notify the sponsor only when the issuer deems it reasonably necessary. This contradicts the definition of 'material change' and 'misrepresentation' under the Securities Act (British Columbia), which mandates immediate disclosure regardless of the issuer's subjective assessment.",

                "changed_text": "The Issuer shall indemnify the Indemnified Parties from loss, except when it arises from misrepresentation that the Indemnified party should have been aware of. This applies to any statement or omission in the Prospectus, or otherwise made or omitted by the Issuer in connection with the Offering.",
                "explanation": "By adding 'except when it arises from misrepresentation that the Indemnified party should have been aware of', the modified text weakens the indemnification clause. This alteration allows the Issuer to avoid indemnification if the Indemnified Parties (Sponsor) should have known about the misrepresentation, directly conflicting with the intention of full indemnity against misstatements in the Prospectus and creating uncertainty about the sponsor's liability under Securities Law.",

                "explanation": "The term 'investigation' was replaced by a 'basic review,' introducing ambiguity. The term investigation implies a more thorough analysis under securities law, while 'basic review' is less demanding. This diminishes the sponsor's obligation to conduct thorough due diligence, potentially resulting in liability.",

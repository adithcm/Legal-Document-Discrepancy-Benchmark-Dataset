                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Continued Service provided by Netzee will be the operation, maintenance, and support of the computer systems, software and interfaces included in the System.",
                "changed_text": "The Continued Service provided by Netzee will be the operation and general upkeep of the computer systems, software and interfaces included in the System.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'maintenance, and support' with 'and general upkeep' introduces ambiguity. 'Maintenance' and 'support' have reasonably well-understood meanings in the context of software and systems, implying specific duties. 'General upkeep' is far broader and less defined, which could lead to disputes about the scope of Netzee's obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding clarity and definiteness of terms; potentially relevant state laws regarding software maintenance agreements if they exist.",
                "location": "Paragraph 2"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (1) standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, and for such purpose Netzee will use commercially reasonable efforts to make and include (without limitation) as such modifications changes and upgrades necessary to comply with generally applicable industry and regulatory requirements of which it is notified",
                "changed_text": "General service provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (1) basic upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally, and for such purpose Netzee will use reasonable efforts to make and include (without limitation) as such modifications changes and upgrades necessary to comply with standard industry practices of which it is notified",
                "explanation": "Changing 'standard maintenance upgrades and modifications' to 'basic upgrades and modifications' and 'generally applicable industry and regulatory requirements' to 'standard industry practices' significantly weakens Netzee's obligations. 'Maintenance' has a clearer technical connotation than 'general service'. Requiring compliance with 'regulatory requirements' is a stronger commitment than adhering to 'standard industry practices'. This undermines the Bank's expectation of legally compliant maintenance.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law regarding reasonable expectations and implied warranties; potentially specific state regulations related to software service agreements or banking technology.",
                "location": "Paragraph 5"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "availability of basic Services with at least 99% uptime between 4:00 a.m Monday and 7:00 p.m. Friday and between 8:00 a.m. Saturday and 2:00 p.m. Saturday Eastern Time, exclusive of outages caused by off-peak prescheduled maintenance or causes beyond Netzee's reasonable control (including third-party equipment or communications).",
                "changed_text": "availability of Services with reasonable uptime during standard business hours, exclusive of outages caused by maintenance or force majeure.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the specific uptime guarantee (99% with defined hours) with 'reasonable uptime during standard business hours' introduces significant uncertainty. The original clause provided a measurable metric; the modified clause is vague and subjective. Removing the explicit mention of 'third-party equipment or communications' makes the 'force majeure' exclusion less defined and potentially more difficult for Bankers Bank to challenge.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and definiteness, especially concerning performance metrics and liability limitations.",

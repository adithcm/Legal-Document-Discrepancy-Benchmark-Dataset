                "explanation": "The definition of 'Capacity' now includes 'volunteer', which contradicts the expected professional capacity of an executive. The definition of 'Confidential Information' now includes 'public knowledge' which is contradictory to its normal and legal understanding. These changes weaken the enforceability of clauses related to capacity and confidentiality, creating uncertainty under UK contract law.",

                "explanation": "By replacing 'Confidential Information' with 'Sensitive Information' in section 15, while 'Sensitive Information' is undefined, a legal contradiction and ambiguity in interpretation is created.

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall disclose' to 'may disclose' and 'all Intellectual Property Rights' to 'some Intellectual Property Rights' significantly weakens the Company's claim to intellectual property created by the Executive. This introduces a contradiction as the original intention was for full ownership, while the modification suggests partial or optional transfer, conflicting with IP law principles concerning assignment of rights.",

                "original_text": "MEMBERSHIP. The person(s) named as the Insured(s) or the Annuitant(s) is a benefit member of the Society. Rights and privileges of membership are set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Society. These rights and privileges are separate from the ownership of this contract.",
                "changed_text": "MEMBERSHIP. The person(s) named as the Insured(s) or the Annuitant(s) is a member of the Society. The extent of membership benefits will be determined at the sole discretion of the Society's board. These rights and privileges are merely additional perks and do not affect the core function of the contract.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the benefits will be determined at the 'sole discretion of the Society's board,' it introduces ambiguity and contradicts the typical understanding of membership rights, potentially conflicting with state laws that regulate fraternal benefit societies and require defined member rights. The phrase 'merely additional perks' diminishes the value of membership, creating a legal uncertainty.",

                "original_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "DIVIDENDS. Each year, we may determine a surplus. The allocation of surplus, considered a bonus, is subject to board approval. No bonus is guaranteed, and historical performance does not dictate future bonus allocations. It is highly improbable that any bonus will be credited.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'divisible surplus' to 'surplus' and 'dividend' to 'bonus' obfuscates the meaning. 'Divisible surplus' and 'dividend' have specific financial and legal meanings in insurance, while 'surplus' and 'bonus' are vague. This creates uncertainty about the policyholder's entitlement to a share of the company's profits, potentially conflicting with state insurance regulations regarding fair allocation of surplus.",

The ASSIGNMENT section is amended to include the following: You may attempt to transfer ownership of this contract; however, such transfer is not guaranteed and is contingent upon our approval, which we may deny at our sole discretion. Society membership rights and privileges are non-transferable and are automatically revoked upon attempted contract transfer.",
                "explanation": "The original text states 'You may transfer ownership...in accordance with our bylaws.' The modified text adds 'however, such transfer is not guaranteed and is contingent upon our approval, which we may deny at our sole discretion,' directly contradicting the initial allowance and adding an unrestricted right of denial. Also, threatening revocation of membership upon attempted transfer is a further contradiction, creating ambiguity and potential for arbitrary denial of assignment, conflicting with contract law principles of assignability and potentially violating state laws governing insurance contract assignments.",

                "explanation": "The definition of \"Affiliate\" is changed from 30% to 5%. This creates a legal contradiction because in other parts of the contract, \"Control\" is defined as 30% or more of the issued share capital.

This contradicts the original definition, which specifically excludes primarily business purposes.

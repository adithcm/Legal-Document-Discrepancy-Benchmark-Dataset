                "original_text": "(c) \"Brand Features\" means each party's respective trademarks, trade names, -------------- service marks, service names and distinct brand elements that appear from time to time in each party's properties, ventures and services worldwide and are protected under U.S. copyright law or as to which each party has established trademarks or trade dress rights and any modifications to the foregoing that may be created during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(c) \"Brand Features\" means each party's general business reputation and goodwill, including any names or images they choose to associate with their services. The parties agree not to enforce any claims of trademark or copyright infringement related to these brand features.",
                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of \"Brand Features\" to encompass general business reputation, which is not typically covered by trademark law. Additionally, waiving the right to enforce trademark and copyright claims directly contradicts intellectual property law, creating a legally unenforceable situation.",

Confidential Information may also include oral information disclosed by one party to the other pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and is reduced to writing by the disclosing party within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days) after its oral disclosure, and such writing is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the receiving party.",
                "changed_text": "(i) \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any information that a party subjectively believes to be confidential, regardless of whether it is marked as such or disclosed in a manner that would reasonably indicate its confidential nature. This includes all information, regardless of its source, that is shared between the parties.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly broadens the definition of \"Confidential Information,\" removing the requirements for marking and objective reasonableness. This is not in alignment with prevailing legal standards for what constitutes confidential information, creating ambiguity and potentially rendering the clause unenforceable.",

Neither party shall have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.",

However, each party may enter into agreements, make representations, or incur debts on behalf of the other party if it appears to be for the benefit of the agreement. Each party may be deemed to be an agent of the other party.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the definition of \"Independent Contractor\" by granting each party the ability to act on behalf of the other, which is a characteristic of an agency relationship, not an independent contractor relationship. This undermines the independent contractor clause and creates potential legal liability issues.",

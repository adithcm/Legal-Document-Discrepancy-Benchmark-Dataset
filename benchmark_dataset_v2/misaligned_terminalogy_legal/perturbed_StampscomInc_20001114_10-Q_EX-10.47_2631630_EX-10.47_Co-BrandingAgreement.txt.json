                "original_text": "The following terms are defined for the purposes of this Agreement as follows:\n\n     (c) \"Brand Features\" means each party's respective trademarks, trade names, service marks, service names and distinct brand elements that appear from time to time in each party's properties, ventures and services worldwide and are protected under U.S. copyright law or as to which each party has established trademarks or trade dress rights and any modifications to the foregoing that may be created during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The following terms are defined for the purposes of this Agreement as follows:\n\n     (c) \"Brand Features\" means each party's logos, color schemes, and marketing slogans that appear from time to time in each party's advertising campaigns and are used by the parties. The parties do not hold any responsibility to protect Brand Features under U.S. copyright law or as to which each party has established trademarks or trade dress rights and any modifications to the foregoing that may be created during the term of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Brand Features' includes legally protected trademarks and trade dress. The modified definition removes this legal protection, and also removes protection under U.S. copyright law, contradicting standard intellectual property law. It introduces uncertainty as to whether the brand features are legally protected.",

Neither party shall, for any purpose, be deemed to be an agent of the other party and the relationship between the parties shall only be that of independent contractors.

                "explanation": "The original language clearly defines the relationship as one of 'independent contractors' where neither party can bind the other. The modified language gives 'each party' the express right to bind the other, which directly contradicts the established definition of an independent contractor and creates uncertainty around liability and obligations.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces ambiguity and contradicts contract law principles. In the original text, both parties had the option to determine commercial agreements with a timeline, after which the contract would automatically renew. In the changed text, the company has the sole discretion, giving it the power to abuse and create uncertainty around what would be deemed 'reasonable'. ",

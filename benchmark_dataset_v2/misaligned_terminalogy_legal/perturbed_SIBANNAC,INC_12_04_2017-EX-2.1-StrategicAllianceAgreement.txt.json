                "original_text": "Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales lead finder for COMPANY. In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY.",
                "changed_text": "Bravatek agrees to serve as a project facilitator for COMPANY. In this capacity, Bravatek will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY.",
                "explanation": "Replacing \"non-exclusive project sales lead finder\" with \"project facilitator\" and \"best efforts\" with \"commercially reasonable efforts\" introduces ambiguity. \"Project facilitator\" lacks a clear legal definition, unlike the original term which implies specific sales-related duties. \"Commercially reasonable efforts\" is a weaker standard than \"best efforts\", potentially lessening Bravatek's obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law regarding the clarity and enforceability of contractual obligations. The vagueness of \"project facilitator\" may render this clause unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any clients introduced by Bravatek and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek may receive a commission, which shall be determined by COMPANY. The commission, if any, will be determined based on COMPANY's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"lead-finder fee\" to \"commission\" is less specific and the original text range from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee is changed to the commission to be determined by the COMPANY's sole discretion. The new text makes compensation completely discretionary, contradicting the original intent of a defined payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring consideration and definite terms. Making the commission entirely discretionary may render the compensation clause unenforceable due to lack of mutuality.",

                "explanation": "Replacing \"indemnify\" with \"consider providing assistance\" and restricting coverage to \"gross negligence\" significantly weakens COMPANY's obligations. Indemnification is a legally defined duty to protect against loss. This change makes it discretionary and raises the threshold for liability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding indemnification clauses. The altered language transforms a mandatory indemnification into a discretionary act, potentially unenforceable as an indemnification clause.",

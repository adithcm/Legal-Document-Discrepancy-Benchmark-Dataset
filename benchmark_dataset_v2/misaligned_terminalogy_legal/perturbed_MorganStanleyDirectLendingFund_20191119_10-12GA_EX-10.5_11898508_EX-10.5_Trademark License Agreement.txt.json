                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non- transferable, and (subject to Section 1.2 hereof) non-sublicensable license for the use of the Brand solely for the Permitted Activity.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, transferable, and (subject to Section 1.2 hereof) non-sublicensable license for the use of the Brand solely for the Permitted Activity.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'non-transferable' to 'transferable' creates a contradiction. The original clause restricts the licensee from transferring the license. This change allows it, conflicting with the intended restriction and standard trademark licensing practices, introducing uncertainty regarding the rights of the licensee to sublicense or assign the brand use.",

Licensee agrees not to do anything inconsistent with such ownership, including (i) filing to register any trademark or service mark containing the Brand or (ii) directly or indirectly challenging, contesting or otherwise",
                "changed_text": "Licensee acknowledges and agrees that, as between the parties, Licensor is presumed to be the owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Brand. Licensee agrees not to do anything inconsistent with such ownership, including (i) filing to register any trademark or service mark containing the Brand or (ii) directly or indirectly challenging, contesting or otherwise",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'is the sole owner' with 'presumed to be the owner' weakens the assertion of ownership. This creates uncertainty about the Licensor's actual ownership and introduces the possibility of challenging their rights, which is inconsistent with standard trademark protection and license agreements. This contradicts the intended effect of establishing clear ownership, a key element of trademark law.",

                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for five years, unless termination occurs pursuant to Sections 4.2 through 4.4.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'in perpetuity' to 'for five years' creates a contradiction. The original clause states the agreement lasts indefinitely. This change imposes a fixed term, conflicting with the initial intention of perpetual duration. This introduces uncertainty about the long-term rights and obligations of the parties, changing the very nature of the agreement from a perpetual to a term-limited one.",

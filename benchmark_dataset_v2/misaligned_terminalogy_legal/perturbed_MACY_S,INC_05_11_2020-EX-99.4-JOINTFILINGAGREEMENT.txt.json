                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with guidelines established for expediency, the undersigned hereby consent to a collaborative filing alongside all Entities Involved (as determined at the discretion of the lead filer) concerning a statement equivalent to Schedule 13D (including revisions and alternative statements) concerning the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this understanding may be referenced in associated filings.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'Rule 13d-1(k)(1)' with 'guidelines established for expediency' to obscure the legal basis. Changed 'Reporting Persons' to 'Entities Involved' and defined it as 'determined at the discretion of the lead filer,' which contradicts the defined term under SEC rules where reporting persons are specifically defined. The term 'statement equivalent to Schedule 13D' introduces ambiguity regarding whether the filing complies with SEC requirements. These changes obscure the clear legal requirements for joint filings under the Securities Exchange Act.",

                "changed_text": "Each signatory affirms an obligation to contribute to adjustments as needed and provide data pertinent to their involvement; however, no signatory assumes liability for either the promptness or precision of overall submissions nor for information provided by co-signatories.",
                "explanation": "Replaced 'responsible for the timely filing of any amendments' with 'obligation to contribute to adjustments as needed', weakening the binding nature of the agreement regarding timely filings. Changed 'completeness and accuracy of the information' to 'data pertinent to their involvement', which is vague and does not guarantee accuracy. The added clause 'no signatory assumes liability for either the promptness or precision of overall submissions nor for information provided by co-signatories' directly contradicts the original clause that holds each party responsible for the accuracy of their information, potentially violating securities law regarding accurate disclosure.",

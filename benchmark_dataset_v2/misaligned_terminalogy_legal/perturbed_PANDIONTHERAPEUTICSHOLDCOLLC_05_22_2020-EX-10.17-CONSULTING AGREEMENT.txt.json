            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Consultant shall perform all services under this Agreement as an \"independent contractor\" and not as an employee or agent of the Company. The Consultant is not authorized to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of, or in the name of, the Company or to bind the Company in any manner.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant shall perform all services under this Agreement as an \"independent contractor.\" The Consultant is authorized to assume or create obligations or responsibilities on behalf of the Company, subject to prior approval by the CFO.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the definition of an independent contractor, who generally does not have the authority to bind the company. Granting the consultant authority to create obligations blurs the line between independent contractor and agent/employee, potentially leading to misclassification under labor laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common Law Definition of Independent Contractor; IRS Guidelines for Independent Contractor vs. Employee",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For purposes of this Section 4, \"Cause\" shall exist in the event of (i) a good faith finding by the Board of Directors of the Company (A) of repeated and willful failure of the Consultant after written notice to perform his reasonable Services for the Company, or (B) that the Consultant has engaged in dishonesty, gross negligence or misconduct; or (ii) the conviction of the Consultant of, or the entry of a pleading of guilty or nolo contendere by the Consultant to, any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Section 4, \"Cause\" shall exist if the Board of Directors determines that the Consultant's performance is deemed unsatisfactory, with no requirement for prior written notice or evidence of willful failure. The decision of the Board shall be final and not subject to appeal.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for 'written notice,' 'repeated and willful failure,' and an objective 'good faith finding,' the definition of 'Cause' becomes arbitrary and allows for termination based on subjective dissatisfaction. This contradicts principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts and could be seen as an unenforceable clause.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Consultant shall be solely responsible for all state and federal income taxes, unemployment insurance and social security taxes in connection with this Agreement and for maintaining adequate workers' compensation insurance coverage.",
                "changed_text": "While the intent is for the Consultant to be responsible for all state and federal income taxes, unemployment insurance and social security taxes, the Company reserves the right to cover some of the taxes related to the consultant's work. The consultant is not responsible for maintaining worker's compensation insurance coverage.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly establishes the Consultant's responsibility for taxes, consistent with independent contractor status. Altering it to suggest the company might cover some taxes and omitting the requirement of worker's compensation coverage creates ambiguity and implies an employer-employee relationship, contradicting the 'independent contractor' classification and potentially violating tax laws.",

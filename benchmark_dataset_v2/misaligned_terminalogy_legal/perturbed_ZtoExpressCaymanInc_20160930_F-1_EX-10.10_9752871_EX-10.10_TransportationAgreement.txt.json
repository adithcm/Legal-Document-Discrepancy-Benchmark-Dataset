            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party B shall have valid and legal licenses for national road transportation. In the event of loss caused to Party A by delivery delay due to vehicles detention for the lack of license, Party B shall compensate for any loss to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall only maintain operational permits, not necessarily licenses for national road transportation. In the event of loss caused to Party A by delivery delay due to vehicles detention for lacking certain documentation, Party B will negotiate compensation.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'licenses' with 'operational permits' and introducing 'negotiate compensation' instead of 'compensate', the text creates ambiguity regarding the required legal compliance. In China, specific licenses are mandatory for road transportation; weakening this requirement introduces a contradiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Road Transportation Regulations of the People's Republic of China",
                "location": "5(d)"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Party B shall ensure the vehicles are in good conditions, the compartments are properly sealed without leakage and the vehicles are equipped with fire-fighting equipment. In the event of parcel damage resulting from leakage or fire, Party B shall indemnify at the standard rate of RMB200 per parcel, and indemnify the actual price for high-end insured parcel (or indemnify by the value of the parcel provided by arbitration department determined by Party A).",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall ensure the vehicles are in reasonable condition, the compartments are adequately sealed, and vehicles may contain optional fire prevention tools. In the event of parcel damage that may stem from any event, Party B might provide a nominal reimbursement that shall be decided by Party B, for high-end parcels, reimbursement will be discussed in line with common practices.",
                "explanation": "The change replaces specific obligations with vague terms ('reasonable condition,' 'adequately sealed,' 'optional fire prevention tools'). Moreover, the defined compensation is replaced with an undefined 'nominal reimbursement,' and the method of arbitration is obscured which weakens the enforceability of the clause. The original text is clear about the liability, while the new text reduces the liability for 'Party B'.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any dispute arising out of the execution of this Agreement, which cannot be negotiated and settled by both Parties, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the People's Court where this Agreement is signed.",
                "changed_text": "Any dispute relating to this Agreement's performance that fails informal resolution might be addressed via a mediator mutually agreeable to both parties. Formal legal proceedings are discouraged.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'People's Court' jurisdiction with mediation, the changed text contradicts standard dispute resolution procedures in China, which typically involve court jurisdiction. This creates a contradiction by steering disputes away from the legally established judicial system, making enforcement more complex and uncertain. It is misaligned because the text introduces a non-legally binding mediation instead of standard court practices.",

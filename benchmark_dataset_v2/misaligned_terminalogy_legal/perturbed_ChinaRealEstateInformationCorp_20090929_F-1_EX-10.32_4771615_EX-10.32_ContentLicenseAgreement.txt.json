                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' hinges on 'control,' which is well-defined in corporate law, especially concerning ownership and voting rights. The modified definition replaces 'controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with' with 'has a business association with.' This phrase is vague and subjective, potentially leading to disputes over whether a particular entity qualifies as an affiliate. This vague relationship does not align with standard definitions of 'affiliate' under corporate law.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the 'Licensee shall monitor and censor all content.' The modified text introduces 'may, at its discretion' and 'endeavor to remove', weakening the obligation. Similarly, failure to comply was 'deemed a material breach' is now 'shall not be deemed a material breach'. This shift from a mandatory obligation to a discretionary one contradicts regulatory expectations around content control, especially concerning illegal or politically sensitive content in China, where the regulations are strict.",

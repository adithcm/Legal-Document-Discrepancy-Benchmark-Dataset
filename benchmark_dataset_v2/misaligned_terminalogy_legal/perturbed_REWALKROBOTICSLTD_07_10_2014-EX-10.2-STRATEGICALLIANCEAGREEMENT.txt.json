            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ARGO agreed to appoint YEC as the exclusive distributor of its products in the Territory specified therein, and YEC agreed to market and distribute Argo's products in a professional manner.",
                "changed_text": "ARGO agreed to appoint YEC as a distributor of its products in the Territory specified therein, and YEC agreed to market and distribute Argo's products as YEC sees fit.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'exclusive distributor' to 'a distributor' and 'in a professional manner' to 'as YEC sees fit' contradicts standard distribution agreements. An 'exclusive distributor' has specific legal implications regarding market exclusivity. Allowing YEC to distribute 'as it sees fit' removes any obligation to uphold industry standards or ARGO's brand reputation, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing which are often legally presumed, especially in distribution agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, potential violation of distribution agreement laws.",
                "location": "Section 3"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations provided for in this Agreement and fails to cure such default within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice from the other party of such default, unless a plan for remedying such default has been proposed by the defaulting party and accepted by the non- defaulting party within such period.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other party, which termination will be effective immediately upon such notice, if the other party doesn't meet targets in the view of the first party. Disagreements regarding target achievement shall not be subject to arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allowed termination only for 'material breaches' with a cure period. The modification allows termination based on 'not meeting targets in the view of the first party' with no cure period and no objective standard. Removing the cure period and objective standard for 'material breach' and replacing it with a subjective assessment of target achievement creates a contradiction. Many jurisdictions require a 'reasonable' standard for contract performance and good faith in termination.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding material breach, good faith, and reasonable standards of performance.",
                "location": "Section 5(a)"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All disputes arising pursuant to this Agreement shall be exclusively brought in the courts of competent jurisdiction residing in Tel Aviv, Israel.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising pursuant to this Agreement may be brought in any forum the claimant chooses.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies exclusive jurisdiction in Tel Aviv, Israel. The modified clause allows disputes to be brought in 'any forum', contradicting the concept of exclusive jurisdiction. Exclusive jurisdiction clauses are generally enforceable, so removing this and allowing any forum introduces legal uncertainty and potential forum shopping, violating the principle of contractual certainty and the agreed-upon dispute resolution process.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding forum selection clauses and exclusive jurisdiction.",

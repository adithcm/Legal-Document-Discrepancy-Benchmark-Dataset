                "original_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person or entity (including either Party), any other person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with that person or entity, or which that person or entity beneficially owns at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity interests therein (provided, however, that with respect to the Parties, no individual or entity as to which the ultimate parent entity of a Party does not directly or indirectly control the operations or management thereof (e.g., in the case of ACSI as of the date of this Agreement, Gear.com, Inc.) shall be deemed to be an Affiliate of such Party for purposes of this Agreement).",
                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person or entity (including either Party), any other person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with that person or entity, or which that person or entity beneficially owns at least ten percent (10%) of the equity interests therein (provided, however, that with respect to the Parties, any individual or entity can be deemed to be an Affiliate of such Party for purposes of this Agreement).",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' has been altered to require only 10% ownership for affiliation and any other entity, potentially contradicting standard legal and accounting definitions of 'affiliate' which generally require a higher threshold of control or ownership (typically 50% or more). This could lead to disputes regarding which entities are bound by the terms of the contract applicable to affiliates.",

                "explanation": "The original clause includes an implied understanding of what should reasonably be considered confidential. The modification removes the concept of implied confidentiality, meaning that even information that should reasonably be considered confidential is not protected unless explicitly designated as such. This conflicts with standard legal interpretations of confidentiality which consider the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with all applicable laws. The modification changes this to 'attempt to comply' and 'a selection of applicable Laws,' creating ambiguity and potentially absolving Company of full legal responsibility.

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the right to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image in connection with the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of ADAMS GOLF'S PRODUCT.",
                "changed_text": "A. CONSULTANT'S \"ENDORSEMENT\" means the privilege to use the CONSULTANT'S name, fame, nickname, autograph, voice, facsimile, signature, photograph, likeness, and image at ADAMS GOLF'S discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'endorsement' grants specific rights to Adams Golf. Modifying it to 'privilege' implies that Adams Golf has the discretion to allow or disallow the consultant's endorsement, contradicting the original intent of a guaranteed right as per standard endorsement agreements.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall exclusively play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play [* ****] clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may not endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT shall mostly play/use the MANDATORY PRODUCT. (It is expressly understood by the parties that CONSULTANT may play any clubs in the bag other than ADAMS GOLF clubs including, but not limited to, a putter by a manufacturer other than ADAMS GOLF but may endorse those clubs and/or putter.)",
                "explanation": "Changing 'exclusively play/use' to 'mostly play/use' and explicitly allowing the endorsement of competitor's clubs contradicts the exclusivity clause, creating uncertainty. An 'exclusive' requirement is unambiguous, whereas 'mostly' is open to interpretation and legal challenge. This also contradicts the prior definition of 'ENDORSEMENT' in section 2.",

                "changed_text": "In the event a disagreement arises under this Agreement, such disagreement may be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator selected by ADAMS GOLF.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a panel of three arbitrators, with a majority decision required. The modified text allows for a single arbitrator chosen by Adams Golf, which fundamentally alters the arbitration process and creates a clear imbalance of power. This contradicts standard arbitration practices that usually require impartiality and mutual agreement on the arbitrator(s).",

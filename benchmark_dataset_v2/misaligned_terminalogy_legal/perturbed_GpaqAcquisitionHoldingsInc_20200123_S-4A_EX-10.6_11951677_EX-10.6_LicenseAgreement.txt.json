For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means an equity or income interest of fifty percent (50%) or more, or the possession of the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Affiliate, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means an operational relationship.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' and 'control' has been altered to introduce ambiguity. Originally, 'control' required a 50% equity or the power to direct management. The modified definition replaces it with 'operational relationship,' which is vague and lacks a clear legal standard. The definition of 'Affiliate' has been changed to be 'related to' and 'associated with', which introduces a level of uncertainty in determining which entities fall under the affiliate definition, thereby contradicting established legal interpretations of corporate control and affiliation.",

Prior to any initial Exploitation of a PFHOF Work, the Village Media Company, at its own expense, must furnish to the Advisory Board and PFHOF a written notice (\"Notice\") which Notice will set forth the Village Media Company's proposal for Exploitation of a PFHOF Work (whether by itself or as incorporated into a HOFV Work), which proposal shall at a minimum specify the applicable PFHOF Work(s) to be Exploited by the Village Media Company, the nature and location of the proposed Exploitation and a pro forma specifying the economics and approximate time period related to such Exploitation. The Advisory Board shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the Notice, make a recommendation to PFHOF to either approve or reject such proposal as set forth in the Notice. PFHOF shall, within fourteen (14) days of its receipt of the recommendation of the Advisory Board, either approve or reject the proposal as set forth in the Notice.",

The Advisory Board shall make suggestions to PFHOF to possibly change such proposal as set forth in the Notice. PFHOF shall give recommendations that should be considered as set forth in the Notice.",
                "explanation": "The term **'approve'** has been replaced by 'suggest changes' and 'give recommendations'. This subtly shifts the legal power from PFHOF having absolute discretion to merely providing suggestions. This creates uncertainty and contradicts the original intent by weakening PFHOF's control over the Exploitation of PFHOF Works and could lead to disputes regarding whether PFHOF's suggestions are binding or merely advisory.",

FORCE MAJEURE In the event either Party is unable to comply fully with its obligations (other than payment obligations) under this Agreement due to an event beyond the control of the Party whose performance is affected, including any legal prohibition, court order, degree, regulation or requirement of any governmental entity having jurisdiction, strikes, catastrophe, drought, shortage of water or other action of the elements, temporary or permanent shutdown due to regulatory or other governmental actions, or Acts of God or any other matters beyond its control, such Party shall while so affected be relieved to the extent thus prevented from performing its obligations hereunder and such non-performance shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement; provided that, in such event, the non-performing Party takes all commercially reasonable measures to remove the disability and resume full performance hereunder at the earliest possible date.",

External Factors In the event either Party is unable to comply fully with its obligations (other than payment obligations) under this Agreement due to external matters to the Party whose performance is affected, including any suggestions of legal action, recommendations, changes in circumstance, minor incidents, or matters beyond its immediate control, such Party shall while so affected be relieved to the extent thus prevented from performing its obligations hereunder and such non-performance shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement; provided that, in such event, the non-performing Party attempts to mitigate the issue.",
                "explanation": "The definition of **'Force Majeure'** has been replaced by 'External Factors'. Force Majeure traditionally encompasses events like natural disasters, legal prohibitions, and other unforeseeable catastrophes. The modified clause broadens the scope to include vague terms like 'suggestions of legal action,' 'minor incidents,' and 'changes in circumstance'. This undermines the established legal understanding of Force Majeure as applying only to extraordinary events beyond a party's control. This creates ambiguity and could lead to parties invoking the clause for trivial reasons, making the contract unenforceable under traditional Force Majeure principles.",

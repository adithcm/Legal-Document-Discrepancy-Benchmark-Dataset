                "explanation": "The original text allows for potential extension of the contract period, while the modified text explicitly prohibits any extension. This creates a contradiction by eliminating the flexibility that was initially provided for, which is not allowed under general contract law that allows modifications by mutual agreement.",

Other products of the Company may be added to the list of Licensed Products during the Contract Period at the Company's sole discretion, regardless of any conflicting stipulations in this agreement. ",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that products can only be added via written amendment. The modified text contradicts this by stating the Company can add products at its sole discretion, overriding the amendment clause.

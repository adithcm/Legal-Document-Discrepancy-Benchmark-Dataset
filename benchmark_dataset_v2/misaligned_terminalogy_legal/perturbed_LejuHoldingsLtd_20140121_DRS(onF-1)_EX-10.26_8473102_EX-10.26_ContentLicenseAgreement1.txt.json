For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the Source: LEJU HOLDINGS LTD, DRS (on F-1), 1/21/2014 relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the possession, directly or indirectly or as trustee, personal representative or executor, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, as trustee, personal representative or executor, by contract, credit arrangement or otherwise.",

For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") with respect to the Source: LEJU HOLDINGS LTD, DRS (on F-1), 1/21/2014 relationship between or among two or more Persons, means the ability to suggest the direction of the affairs or management of a Person, whether through informal agreements or other arrangements.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" relied on the established legal concept of \"control\", which is typically defined as the power to direct management and policies. The modified definition replaces \"controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with\" with \"may influence the decisions of\". It also changes \"means the possession...of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management\" to \"means the ability to suggest the direction of the affairs or management.\" This weakens the definition, creating ambiguity and contradicting standard legal interpretations of affiliate relationships, particularly under PRC company law where control is a key factor.",

Licensee shall remove any offending Content, including, but not limited to, any illegal materials, pornographic, obscene or sexually explicit materials, materials of a violent nature, or politically sensitive materials, from such websites as soon as possible after it becomes aware of such offending Content but in no event later than the timeframe prescribed by the Governmental Authority after receipt of oral or written notice from Licensor or such Governmental Authority.",

Licensor may, at its convenience, monitor Content of the websites associated with Licensed Domain Names. Licensee shall consider removing any potentially inappropriate Content from such websites should it deem necessary. The timeframe for removal will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposed a clear obligation on the Licensee to 'monitor and censor' content and remove 'offending content' within a defined timeframe, aligning with PRC's strict internet content regulations. The modified version replaces 'shall monitor and censor' with 'shall endeavor to monitor', introduces discretion with 'may, at its convenience', and replaces 'shall remove' with 'shall consider removing'. The removal timeframe is changed to 'assessed on a case-by-case basis'. These changes weaken the obligation and contradict the legal requirement for prompt and effective content control under PRC law.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall generally refer to documents that are explicitly marked as 'Confidential'. Information shared verbally or in informal settings will not be considered Confidential Information unless otherwise agreed to in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Confidential Information\" was broad, covering a wide range of information regardless of whether it was explicitly marked as confidential. The modified version narrows this significantly, requiring explicit marking for documents to be considered confidential and excluding verbally shared information unless otherwise agreed in writing. This contradicts standard interpretations of confidentiality agreements under PRC contract law, which often protect a broader range of information based on the nature of the relationship and the sensitivity of the information exchanged, regardless of explicit markings.",

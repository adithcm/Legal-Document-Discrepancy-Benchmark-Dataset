                "original_text": "1.1. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion.",
                "changed_text": "1.1. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a general, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark at its discretion, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'personal' to 'general' broadens the scope of the license beyond the legally understood definition of a personal license. Also, substituting 'only to the extent permitted under this Agreement' with 'at its discretion' significantly alters the control the licensor has over the use of the Licensed Mark by the Licensee. These create uncertainty regarding the permissible use of the trademark, contradicting standard trademark licensing practices.",

                "original_text": "The Licensee shall not by any act or omission use the Licensed Mark in any manner that disparages or reflects adversely on Licensor or its business or reputation.",
                "changed_text": "The Licensee shall endeavor not to use the Licensed Mark in any manner that disparages or reflects adversely on Licensor or its business or reputation.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not' to 'shall endeavor not to' weakens the obligation on the Licensee. This creates ambiguity and makes it harder to enforce the clause, as 'endeavor' implies an attempt rather than a strict prohibition. This contradicts standard contract law where clear obligations are expected to be precisely defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law, specifically regarding the definiteness of obligations.",

The parties unconditionally and irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New York and waive any objection with respect thereto, for the purpose of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted at the parties' discretion. The parties agree to attempt resolution through arbitration, but are not required to follow New York laws.",
                "explanation": "By stating the agreement should be 'interpreted at the parties' discretion' and removing the governing law provision, the contract's enforceability becomes uncertain. This directly contradicts standard contract law which relies on established legal frameworks for interpretation and enforcement. Further, removing the jurisdiction clause introduces more uncertainty and potential unenforceability because there is no clear venue for resolving disputes.",

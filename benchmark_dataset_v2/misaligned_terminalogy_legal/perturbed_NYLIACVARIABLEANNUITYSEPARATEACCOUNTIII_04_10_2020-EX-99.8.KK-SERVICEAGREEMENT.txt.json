                "original_text": "FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided.",
                "changed_text": "FIIOC agrees to provide to Company information. The specifics of provided company information will be defined at the discretion of FIIOC.",
                "explanation": "The modified text replaces the detailed list of 'investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc.' with the vague term 'company information.' This creates a contradiction because the original agreement implies a certain standard of information to be provided, while the modified text gives FIIOC complete discretion, undermining the contract's enforceability concerning the information's nature and scope.",

                "original_text": "In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.",
                "changed_text": "In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC may pay Company a fee, as determined by FIIOC. The compensation will be determined by FIIOC's discretion. ",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the clear, formula-based compensation structure with a discretionary payment determined by FIIOC. This introduces a contradiction by making the compensation terms vague and unenforceable, as there is no objective standard for determining the fee. This shift contradicts basic contract law principles requiring consideration to be reasonably certain.",

                "changed_text": "FIIOC may terminate this Agreement for any reason they see fit to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original termination clause provides specific, justifiable reasons for immediate termination. The modified clause allows FIIOC to terminate the agreement for any reason whatsoever, thereby contradicting the principle of 'good faith' and fair dealing implied in contract law. This unlimited discretion creates uncertainty and potential for abuse, making the contract potentially unenforceable or subject to legal challenge.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of state contract law principles.",

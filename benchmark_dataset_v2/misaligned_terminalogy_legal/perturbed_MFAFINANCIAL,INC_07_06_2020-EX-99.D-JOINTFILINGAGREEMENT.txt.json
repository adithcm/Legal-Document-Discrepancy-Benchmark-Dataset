                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with internal policy, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the reference to Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with a vague 'internal policy' creates uncertainty. Rule 13d-1(k) provides a specific legal framework for joint filings, whereas 'internal policy' is undefined and could allow for interpretations that conflict with the SEC rule. This change makes it unclear which standard governs the joint filing agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows each counterpart to be considered an original, reflecting standard legal practice. The modified text restricts 'original' status to only the first signed copy, potentially invalidating other signed copies and creating disputes over which version controls. This contradicts standard contract law where all original counterparts have equal legal standing.",

                "original_text": "1.38 \"Control\" means, with respect to any item of Intellectual Property or material, the possession (whether by ownership or license, other than by a license granted pursuant to this Agreement) by a Party or its Affiliates of the ability to grant to the other Party access, ownership, a license or a sublicense as required herein to such item, without: (a) violating the terms of any agreement or other arrangement with any Third Party in existence as of the time such Party or its Affiliates would be required hereunder to grant the other Party such access, ownership, license or sublicense; (b) violating any Applicable Law, or (c) incurring payment obligations by reason of providing access, ownership, a license or a sublicense to the other Party with respect thereto (unless such other Party agrees in writing to bear such payment obligations [***] to providing access, ownership, a license or a sublicense to such item by such other Party).",
                "changed_text": "1.38 \"Control\" means, with respect to any item of Intellectual Property or material, the possession (whether by ownership or license, other than by a license granted pursuant to this Agreement) by a Party or its Affiliates of the ability to grant to the other Party access, ownership, a license or a sublicense as required herein to such item, regardless of: (a) the terms of any agreement or other arrangement with any Third Party in existence; (b) Applicable Law, or (c) payment obligations incurred. It is at the sole discretion of the controlling party to grant access, ownership, a license or a sublicense to the other Party.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Control\" aligns with standard legal interpretations, ensuring that a party can only grant rights if they don't violate existing agreements, applicable laws, or incur undue payment obligations. The modified definition removes these constraints and introduces ambiguity by stating it is up to the controlling party's discretion. This contradicts established legal principles and could lead to disputes over intellectual property rights.",

Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party, as of the Effective Date, as follows: 11.1.3 this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party and constitutes a legal and valid obligation binding upon such Party and enforceable against it in accordance with its terms;",

Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party, as of the Effective Date, as follows: 11.1.3 this Agreement has been executed and delivered on behalf of such Party, however, its validity and enforceability are not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a standard representation that the agreement is legally binding. The modified version introduces uncertainty by stating that validity and enforceability are not guaranteed. This contradicts the purpose of a legal contract, which is to create a binding obligation. This creates an internal contradiction, undermining the foundation of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Delaware law as the governing law, providing legal certainty. The modified version makes the governing law dependent on a random choice at the time of a dispute, introducing significant uncertainty and contradicting the principle of having a pre-defined legal framework for the contract. This change introduces a perturbation that undermines the predictability and enforceability of the contract, as the applicable law is unknown until a dispute arises.",

                "original_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or oversee any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or proprietor of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than fifteen (15%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and extensive augmentations thereof, which may include irregular, critical transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller obtains influence after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $100,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the casual association, directly or indirectly, of the capacity to advise or gently sway the management and policies of a Person, whether through loose acquaintances of voting recommendations, by informal agreement or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'own, manage, operate or control' were replaced with 'own, manage, operate or oversee', weakening the scope of prohibited activities. The definition of 'control' was changed to 'casual association', dramatically reducing the threshold for what constitutes control. The clause restricting investment in competing entities was changed from 5% to 15%. The type of transaction that is allowed to take place by the seller, was changed from routine to 'irregular, critical'. The financial protection that allows the seller to acquire another business was changed from $25,000,000 to $100,000,000.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law on non-compete agreements requires them to be reasonable in scope and not overly broad. The changes introduce ambiguity and potentially render the non-compete agreement unenforceable due to vagueness and overbreadth.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) suggest, invite, enlist or loosely encourage any employee of the Combined Business to rethink their employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) extend an offer of prospective employment to any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) extending invitations for prospective employment to previously contracted individuals of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was amicably concluded by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least two weeks prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) engaging with employees of the Combined Business via a common solicitation through a digital channel that does not distinguish recipients or prior affiliates of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall explicitly enable any Seller to immediately onboard any such employees without restriction during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "explanation": "Changed 'induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade' to 'suggest, invite, enlist or loosely encourage', weakening the restrictions on employee solicitation. Changed 'solicit the employment' to 'extend an offer of prospective employment,' narrowly defining the restricted activity. The waiting period for hiring former employees was reduced from six months to two weeks and changed 'terminated by Buyer' to 'amicably concluded'. The restriction on hiring employees contacted through general solicitations was removed, now allowing immediate hiring.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law on non-solicitation agreements requires reasonable restrictions to protect legitimate business interests. These modifications significantly weaken the restrictions, potentially making the agreement unenforceable as it no longer adequately protects the Buyer's interests.",

                "original_text": "5. Injunctive Relief; Attorneys Fees. Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement. If any action or proceeding shall be commenced to enforce this Agreement or any right arising in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party the reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by such prevailing party in connection with such action or proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "5. Remedial Actions; Cost Allocation. Each Seller acknowledges that in the unlikely event of a tangible violation of this Agreement that materially affects Buyer, the harm to Buyer is difficult to calculate precisely, suggesting that financial reparations may sometimes be conditionally insufficient. Subsequently, both parties assent that Buyer shall have access, congruent with financial redress arising from infractions, to claim provisional remedies (inclusive of precise enforcement) directed at the Sellers for infringement of this Agreement, contingent on Buyer securing a financial assurance. Should a formal legal process be undertaken to validate adherence to this Agreement or to assert a specific entitlement connected to it, the expenses for attorneys will be evenly split between all participating entities, except where a deliberate fraudulent act is conclusively established.",
                "explanation": "Changed 'Injunctive Relief' to 'Remedial Actions' to broaden the scope of possible remedies beyond just injunctive relief, however, now 'monetary damages shall be inadequate' has been changed to 'financial reparations may sometimes be conditionally insufficient' creating uncertainty. Requirement to post a bond for injunctive relief, previously waived, is now present (even though it is made as Buyer securing a financial assurance). The change from 'reasonable attorneys' fees' to 'expenses for attorneys will be evenly split' contradicts the typical 'prevailing party' standard for fee recovery.",
                "contradicted_law": "Under Pennsylvania law, parties are generally free to contract regarding remedies for breach, but waivers must be clear and unambiguous. The change from 'inestimable' damages to 'difficult to calculate precisely' weakens the assertion of irreparable harm required for injunctive relief. The requirement to now secure a financial assurance introduces an obstacle to obtaining injunctive relief. The equal splitting of attorney's fees contradicts the general principle that the prevailing party is entitled to recover fees.",

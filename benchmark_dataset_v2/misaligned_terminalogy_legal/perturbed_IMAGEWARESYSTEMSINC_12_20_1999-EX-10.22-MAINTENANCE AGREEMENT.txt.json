                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base agreement. Error includes malfunctions and defects.",
                "changed_text": "ERROR means any instance where the Program does not function as the Customer subjectively expects. Error may include cosmetic issues and desired feature enhancements, at XIMAGE's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'ERROR' is tied to the 'program specifications,' creating an objective standard. The modified definition introduces a subjective element ('Customer subjectively expects') and broadens the scope significantly (including cosmetic issues/feature enhancements at XIMAGE's discretion), contradicting standard software maintenance agreements where errors are tied to documented specifications, creating uncertainty on what constitutes a valid error and when maintenance services are triggered.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "XIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof \"Software Maintenance Services\" which shall include remedial maintenance service (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error, malfunction or defect (collectively in \"Error\") in the Software so that the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set forth in the related documentation. Correction of Errors is subject to MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or neglect of the products by MORPHO.",
                "changed_text": "XIMAGE may, at its sole discretion, provide Software Maintenance Services to MORPHO. The provision of such services is dependent on resource availability and XIMAGE's assessment of the severity of any reported issue. XIMAGE is not obligated to correct any Error, regardless of its impact on the Software's functionality or conformance to specifications.",
                "explanation": "This change transforms a defined obligation ('XIMAGE will provide') into a discretionary action ('XIMAGE may, at its sole discretion'). It also removes the requirement for the software to operate according to specifications. This introduces a significant contradiction because the original text implies a guarantee of service to fix significant errors, while the modified text provides no such guarantee, creating uncertainty regarding XIMAGE's responsibilities. Further, this perturbation contradicts the initial definition that XIMAGE will provide software maintenance services. This would create an issue to enforce.",

                "original_text": "XIMAGE will maintain a 24 hour a day reporting facility to accept calls from MORPHO. XIMAGE agrees to respond to any telephone call made, within 30 minutes.",
                "changed_text": "XIMAGE will attempt to maintain a reporting facility to accept calls from MORPHO during regular business hours. XIMAGE will endeavor to acknowledge telephone calls within a reasonable timeframe, subject to staff availability.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes a clear and specific obligation for XIMAGE to maintain a 24/7 reporting facility and respond within 30 minutes. The modified text weakens this obligation by using vague and subjective language ('attempt to maintain,' 'regular business hours,' 'endeavor to acknowledge,' 'reasonable timeframe,' 'subject to staff availability'). This creates a contradiction because the original text sets a defined standard of service, while the modified text allows XIMAGE significant leeway to avoid meeting that standard, creating uncertainty about the level of support MORPHO can expect.",

Subject to Emdeon's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, Emdeon is hereby authorized and licensed to use the Content by making such Content available to third parties verbatim or as source material via the Software. Such license is a non-exclusive, non-transferrable and worldwide license and shall include the right to use, reproduce, copy and publish the Content solely in connection with the Software.

                "explanation": "The original contract states that the license is 'non-transferrable' and 'Emdeon may not change the substance of the Content to any extent whatsoever without WebMD's written approval of the change.' By removing 'non-' from the word 'non-transferrable' and removing 'may not change the substance of the Content to any extent whatsoever without WebMD's written approval of the change', it now states the license is 'transferrable' and 'Emdeon may change the substance of the Content without WebMD's approval of the change.' These changes contradict the nature of a non-exclusive license, which typically restricts transferability and modification of licensed content without the licensor's consent. This creates uncertainty in enforcement, as the rights and limitations surrounding the licensed content are now ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "The original contract disclaims all warranties related to the content provided. The modified version contradicts this by now stating that WebMD *makes* representations and provides warranties, including those of merchantability and fitness. This directly opposes the standard disclaimers permissible under contract law, creating a conflict. If the disclaimer is removed, it creates the implication that WebMD is liable for what it is providing. It creates uncertainty because the agreement is intended to be a content licensing agreement without guarantee. The inclusion of 'WebMD EXPRESSLY PROVIDES WARRANTIES' implies that Emdeon and other 3rd parties can hold WebMD liable for outcomes or damages.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly defines the relationship as 'independent contractor,' which carries specific legal implications regarding liability and authority. The modified version changes this to 'agent,' thereby creating an agency relationship. This fundamental shift contradicts the intent of the original clause and alters the legal responsibilities and rights of both parties. An agent has the authority to act on behalf of the principal, which is a direct contradiction of the original agreement that states WebMD has no authority to make any representation on behalf of Emdeon.",

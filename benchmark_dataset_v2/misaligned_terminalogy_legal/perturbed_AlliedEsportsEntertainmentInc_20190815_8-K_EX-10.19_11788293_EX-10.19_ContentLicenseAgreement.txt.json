                "original_text": "The parties desire to work cooperatively, but independently, to use commercially reasonable efforts to engage in the marketing and promotional activities described in Exhibit A, including, but not limited to Zynga promoting the WPT brand in a WPT-branded Zynga Poker Tournament Mode, and WPT promoting the Zynga brand in WPT Tournaments and WPT Invitational Tournaments.",

                "explanation": "The phrase 'commercially reasonable efforts' has been removed. This shifts the commitment from a standard legally defined and understood to a potentially lower, undefined standard. This creates uncertainty as to what level of effort is required, contradicting the original intent and potentially leading to unenforceability of this clause under contract law.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Annual Minimum Guarantee' has been replaced with 'Annual Recommended Payment.' This undermines the obligatory nature of the payment. A 'guarantee' has a specific legal meaning, implying a firm commitment. 'Recommended Payment' suggests it is optional, directly contradicting the purpose of a minimum guarantee and creating a legal contradiction. This introduces ambiguity about the financial obligations, potentially making this section unenforceable as written.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that each party 'carry liability insurance sufficient to cover the risks' in the agreement. This has been changed to only requiring parties to 'attempt to obtain liability insurance.' This creates ambiguity and potentially voids the original clause. The original clause created clear obligations while the modified text is vague and may only require the parties to inquire about liability insurance.",

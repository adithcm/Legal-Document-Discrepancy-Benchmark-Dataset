                "original_text": "Party B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to charge Service Fee from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "Party B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to charge Service Fee from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee will approximately correlate to the profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee based on market conditions, without the required consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "explanation": "The original text tied the service fee directly to profits, which is a clear and enforceable metric. Changing 'equal to the amount of profits gained' to 'approximately correlate to profits' introduces ambiguity. Additionally, changing 'at its own discretion' to 'based on market conditions' shifts the decision-making rationale. This creates uncertainty in how the service fee is calculated, deviating from a clear contractual obligation to a more subjective assessment, making the contract more difficult to enforce. Under PRC contract law, clarity and definiteness of terms are crucial for enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "Party A and Party B agree and confirm that the term of cooperation under this Agreement shall commence from the execution date hereof and end at a mutually agreed upon future date, subject to renegotiation every five years (\"Term of Cooperation\").",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies the end date clearly linked to Party B's operation term. Modifying it to a 'mutually agreed upon future date' and adding 'subject to renegotiation every five years' introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes. The original term was objective, while the modified term is subjective and dependent on future agreement. This contradicts the spirit of a fixed-term contract by introducing a variable, making the contract duration uncertain and potentially unenforceable as a long-term commitment. This can violate basic principles of contract law requiring clarity in essential terms.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the People's Republic of China that are promulgated and are publicly available, provided that the general international business practices shall apply if the laws of the People's Republic of China that are promulgated and are publicly available do not involve any matter in relation to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted according to principles of fairness and mutual benefit, considering the intent of both parties. In cases of ambiguity, relevant customs and general business principles may be consulted, but not necessarily applied.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies that the laws of the PRC will govern the agreement, offering legal certainty. The modified text replaces this with vague principles of 'fairness' and 'mutual benefit,' which are subjective and open to interpretation. While 'customs and general business principles' are mentioned, their application is discretionary ('may be consulted, but not necessarily applied'), further undermining the governing law provision. This weakens the enforceability of the contract by creating uncertainty regarding the applicable legal framework. This change moves away from statutory law to subjective interpretation, potentially conflicting with Article 5 of the General Principles of Civil Law.",

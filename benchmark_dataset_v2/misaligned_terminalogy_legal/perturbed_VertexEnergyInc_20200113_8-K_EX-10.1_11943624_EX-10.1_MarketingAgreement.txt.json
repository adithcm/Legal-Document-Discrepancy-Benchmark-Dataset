                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Business Day\" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal Reserve Bank holiday. A Business Day shall open at 8:00a.m. and close at 5:00p.m. Houston, Texas, time.",
                "changed_text": "\"Business Day\" means any day the Parties deem appropriate, irrespective of weekends, holidays, or standard business hours. A Business Day shall open and close at times determined at the sole discretion of Bunker One.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition introduces uncertainty and contradicts standard legal definitions of a 'Business Day'. By allowing the parties to arbitrarily define a business day, it creates a conflict with established legal and financial norms, potentially affecting payment schedules and other time-sensitive obligations under the contract. This undermines the enforceability of clauses relying on a clear definition of 'Business Day'.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law, Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) related to business days for transactions.",
                "location": "Section 1. Definitions"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Inventory\" shall mean the Product purchased by Bunker One pursuant to this Agreement. \"Inventory Cost\" shall mean the amount paid by Bunker One to Vertex for the Inventory. \"Inventory Market Value\" shall mean the then current market value of Inventory as determined by Bunker One on a mark-to-market basis in a commercially reasonable manner.",
                "changed_text": "\"Inventory\" shall mean any material related to bunker fuel activities, regardless of its origin or purchase method. \"Inventory Cost\" shall mean an amount Bunker One deems appropriate for internal accounting purposes. \"Inventory Market Value\" shall mean a value determined by Bunker One based on undisclosed methods, not necessarily reflecting actual market conditions.",
                "explanation": "This change redefines key terms related to inventory valuation, contradicting standard accounting principles and potentially violating regulations related to fair market value. By giving Bunker One complete discretion in determining Inventory Cost and Inventory Market Value, it creates opportunities for manipulation and obscures the true financial performance of the joint venture. This uncertainty affects how profits and losses are calculated and distributed.",
                "contradicted_law": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), potential violations of tax laws related to valuation.",

                "original_text": "13.1. This Agreement shall be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.",
                "changed_text": "13.1. This Agreement shall be governed, interpreted, and construed in accordance with principles of fairness and equity, as determined solely by Bunker One, without regard to any specific jurisdiction's laws.",
                "explanation": "This alteration completely subverts the choice of law clause. By removing the reference to Alabama law and instead relying on subjective 'principles of fairness and equity' as determined by one party (Bunker One), the contract becomes highly ambiguous and unenforceable. This directly contradicts the purpose of a choice of law clause, which is to provide certainty regarding the legal framework governing the agreement. A court is unlikely to enforce a contract where one party has the sole discretion to determine the governing legal principles.",

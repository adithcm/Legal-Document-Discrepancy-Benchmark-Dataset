                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "AJR shall indemnify each XC Indemnified Party and hold each XC Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred by any XC Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, as a result of or based upon any of the following: (i) any breach by AJR of any of its agreements, covenants or obligations hereunder; or (ii) the use of any of the Licensed Materials in a manner that is not permitted hereby.",
                "changed_text": "AJR may, at its discretion, provide financial assistance to XC Indemnified Parties if they experience difficulties due to a breach by AJR of its agreements or the misuse of Licensed Materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states AJR 'shall indemnify,' which means a legal obligation to compensate for losses. The changed text introduces 'may, at its discretion,' making the indemnification optional and contradicting the legally binding nature of indemnification. This creates uncertainty in enforcement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - specifically relating to the enforceability of indemnification clauses.",

                "changed_text": "For purposes hereof, the term 'Losses' might include possible costs, but there is no guarantee.",
                "explanation": "The initial text defines 'Losses' to mean 'out-of-pocket costs and expenses' clearly. The modified text changes this to 'might include possible costs, but there is no guarantee'. This contradicts the original, defined meaning, introducing ambiguity and making the extent of liability unclear, impacting the enforceability of indemnification.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract Law - specifically relating to the definition of terms and enforceability.",
                "location": "Section 11(g)"

                "original_text": "XC and AJR shall not be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations hereunder which is principally the result of the occurrence of an Event of Force Majeure. In the event of any such delay or failure, XC or AJR, as applicable, shall immediately furnish written notice thereof and the reason therefor to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "XC and AJR might attempt to avoid liability to the other for any delay, that is not their fault. In case of delay, notifying the other party is suggested.",
                "explanation": "The original 'shall not be liable' establishes a clear exemption from liability under Force Majeure. The modified text replaces this with 'might attempt to avoid liability'. Additionally, 'shall immediately furnish written notice' is changed to 'notifying the other party is suggested', making it non-mandatory. This contradiction undermines the certainty provided by the Force Majeure clause and increases uncertainty.",

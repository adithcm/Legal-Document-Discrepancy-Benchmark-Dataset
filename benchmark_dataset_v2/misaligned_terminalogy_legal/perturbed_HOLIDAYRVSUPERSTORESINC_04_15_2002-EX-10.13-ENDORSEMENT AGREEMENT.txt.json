                "original_text": "AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\").",
                "changed_text": "AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive permission (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\").",
                "explanation": "Changing 'license' to 'permission' alters the legally recognized nature of the agreement. A 'license' has specific legal connotations regarding rights and responsibilities, particularly regarding trademarks. 'Permission' is a more general term and introduces ambiguity, potentially weakening AGI's protection of its trademarks under federal trademark law.",

                "original_text": "The Company agrees that its use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is restricted to the Approved Use, and the Company shall not use the Trademarks or the Good Sam name or logo for any other purpose. In connection with the Approved Use, the Company shall not use the Trademarks or the Good Sam name or logo in any manner that is detrimental to AGI, the Good Sam Club or any of their affiliates or any of their respective goodwill or business.",
                "changed_text": "The Company agrees that its use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is restricted to the General Use, and the Company shall not use the Trademarks or the Good Sam name or logo for any other purpose. In connection with the General Use, the Company shall use the Trademarks or the Good Sam name or logo in any manner that benefits AGI, the Good Sam Club or any of their affiliates or any of their respective goodwill or business.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'Approved Use' to 'General Use' and saying that the trademark should be used in a way that 'benefits', it creates contradiction. In addition, it opens up interpretation issues as it is hard to measure 'benefit'. The former statement was clear that the business should not be 'detrimental'.",

                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event of a insignificant breach by the other Party which remains uncured after thirty days written notice thereof.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'material breach' to 'insignificant breach' creates a contradiction because material breaches are serious violations that allow contract termination while minor breaches do not normally permit contract termination. This change allows termination for inconsequential reasons, conflicting with standard contract law principles regarding breach and remedies.",

                "original_text": "1.1. \"Affiliate\" means any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with Sonos or IAC, as the case may be, now or in the future (control shall be deemed to mean having a right to 50% of the entity's profits or ownership of at least 50% of the voting rights in the entity).",
                "changed_text": "1.1. \"Affiliate\" means any entity associated with Sonos or IAC, as the case may be, now or in the future (control shall be deemed to mean having a friendly relationship).",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies clear criteria for determining an 'Affiliate' based on control through profit rights or voting rights. The modified version replaces these objective criteria with subjective language such as 'associated with' and 'friendly relationship.' This creates ambiguity and contradicts the standard legal definition of 'control' in corporate law, making it difficult to enforce obligations related to affiliates.",

                "changed_text": "1.10. \"Defective Product\" means any Product that either party deems to be not of satisfactory quality.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides objective criteria for determining a 'Defective Product' based on non-compliance with specific documents like Specifications, Purchase Order, and Statement of Work. The modified version introduces a subjective standard of 'satisfactory quality' as deemed by either party. This lacks a clear legal benchmark and could lead to disputes, contradicting the principle of objective determination of defects in contract law.",

                "original_text": "4.8. Compliance with Laws and Regulations for Manufacturing; Fair Labor Practices. IAC shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to the manufacturing and/or production of the Products in jurisdictions in which IAC manufactures the Products, including labor and employment, environmental, safety, tax and other similar regulations. In addition, IAC currently complies and will continue to comply with any applicable regulations regarding foreign child labor laws and other abusive labor practices.",
                "changed_text": "4.8. Compliance with Laws and Regulations for Manufacturing; Fair Labor Practices. IAC shall endeavor to comply with most laws and regulations related to the manufacturing and/or production of the Products, aiming for general ethical standards. IAC will try its best to avoid child labor.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to labor practices. The modified version softens this obligation by stating that IAC will 'endeavor to comply with most laws' and 'aim for general ethical standards,' effectively turning a legal requirement into a discretionary guideline. This directly contradicts the legal expectation of full compliance and introduces uncertainty about the enforceability of these provisions, particularly regarding labor and environmental laws.",

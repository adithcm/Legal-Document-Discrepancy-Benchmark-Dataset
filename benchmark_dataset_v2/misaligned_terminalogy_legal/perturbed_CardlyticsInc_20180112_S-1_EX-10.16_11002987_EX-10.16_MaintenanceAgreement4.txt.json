                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "No-charge Maintenance Services shall be provided from the Delivery Date through the Warranty Period. The first paid (Initial) Maintenance Term shall commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "Complimentary Support shall be provided from the Delivery Date through the Warranty Period. The first billable (Initial) Assistance Period shall commence upon expiration of the Warranty Period and shall continue for twelve (12) months thereafter.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'Maintenance Services' with 'Complimentary Support' and 'Maintenance Term' with 'Assistance Period' introduces ambiguity. While the original terms have established meanings in the context of software agreements, the replacements are less defined, potentially leading to disputes about the scope and quality of service provided, as legal standards exist for 'Maintenance' but not necessarily for 'Assistance'.",

                "original_text": "Thereafter, the Maintenance Term shall automatically renew for successive period, 12 months, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless Bank of America terminates Maintenance Services pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Subsequently, the Support Period will renew at the discretion of Cardlytics, 12 months, based on perceived service quality unless Bank of America opts out of future support.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Maintenance Term shall automatically renew' to 'Support Period will renew at the discretion of Cardlytics' fundamentally alters the renewal terms. Automatic renewal is a standard contractual clause, whereas discretionary renewal introduces uncertainty and contradicts implied expectations of continued support, creating a condition that could be deemed unconscionable. 'Opts out' is an informal way of saying it, so it is less enforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law regarding implied terms and good faith.",
                "location": "Schedule A, Section C"

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Bank of America may terminate Maintenance Services for convenience at any time in accordance with the Section entitled \"Termination\" of the Agreement. If Bank of America terminates the Maintenance Services, Bank of America shall have the right to reinstate the Maintenance Services without paying any reinstatement fee.",
                "changed_text": "Bank of America can discontinue active assistance at any point in accordance with the Termination section. If Bank of America discontinues active assistance, re-engagement is subject to a service re-activation fee determined by Cardlytics.",
                "explanation": "Substituting 'terminate Maintenance Services for convenience' with 'discontinue active assistance' softens the termination right. Adding 'service re-activation fee determined by Cardlytics' contradicts the original clause allowing reinstatement without a fee. This creates a conflict that affects the economic balance of the agreement, as the fee imposition could be viewed as a penalty for exercising a termination right, potentially violating contract law principles.",

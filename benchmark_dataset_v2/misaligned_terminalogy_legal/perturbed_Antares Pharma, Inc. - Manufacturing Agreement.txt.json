                "original_text": "\"cGMP\" means current good manufacturing practice and standards as provided for (and as amended from time to time) in the \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations\" of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (21CFR§4; 21CFR§210/211 and 21CFR§820) and in European Community Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, any U.S., European, or other applicable laws, regulations or respective guidance documents now or subsequently established by a governmental or regulatory authority, and any arrangements, additions, or clarifications;",
                "changed_text": "\"cGMP\" means preferred manufacturing practice and suggested standards as provided for in the \"Recommended Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines\" of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and in International Guidelines concerning medical devices, any suggested U.S., European, or other laws, regulations or respective guidance documents now or subsequently established by any advisory authority, and any voluntary arrangements, suggestions, or clarifications;",
                "explanation": "By changing \"current good manufacturing practice and standards\" to \"preferred manufacturing practice and suggested standards,\" the contract now suggests these practices are optional rather than mandatory. This directly contradicts the legally enforced standards of the FDA under 21 CFR Part 210/211 and weakens the enforceability of quality controls.",

AMAG shall conduct release testing for Prefilled Syringes.",
                "changed_text": "AMAG shall endeavor to supply Prefilled Syringes to Antares or its Subcontractor. AMAG will consider using a Third Person to manufacture any aspect of the Drug and the Prefilled Syringes. AMAG may conduct release testing for Prefilled Syringes.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"shall supply\" with \"shall endeavor to supply\", and \"will have\" with \"will consider\", the contract makes AMAG's obligation to provide prefilled syringes non-compulsory. Similarly, changing \"shall conduct\" to \"may conduct\" makes the release testing voluntary. This could lead to disputes over AMAG's supply obligations and directly impacts Antares' ability to perform its manufacturing services as the manufacturer, violating the regulations and guidelines.",

                "original_text": "Antares shall permit the FDA and other Regulatory Authorities to conduct inspections of each Manufacturing Site as they may request, including pre-approval inspections, and shall cooperate with such Regulatory Authorities with respect to the inspections and any related matters, in each case which is related to the Device, Product or sample Product. Antares shall give AMAG notice within [***] of becoming aware of any such inspections, and keep AMAG reasonably informed about the results and conclusions of each regulatory inspection, including actions taken by Antares or its Subcontractor to remedy conditions cited in the inspections, to the extent such results and conclusions relate to the Device, Product or sample Product.",
                "changed_text": "Antares will consider permitting the FDA and other Advisory Institutions to visit Manufacturing Sites if reasonably convenient, excluding pre-approval inspections, and will aim to cooperate with such Advisory Institutions if practical with respect to general matters. Antares will attempt to notify AMAG if reasonably possible of any such visits, and provide some information about the summary of each advisory visit.",
                "explanation": "By changing \"shall permit\" to \"will consider permitting\", \"Regulatory Authorities\" to \"Advisory Institutions\", and removing the obligation for pre-approval inspections, the contract reduces Antares' obligation to allow regulatory inspections. The change from \"shall cooperate\" to \"will aim to cooperate\" further weakens compliance. The statement contradicts the FDA's legal right to inspect manufacturing facilities and compromises regulatory oversight.",

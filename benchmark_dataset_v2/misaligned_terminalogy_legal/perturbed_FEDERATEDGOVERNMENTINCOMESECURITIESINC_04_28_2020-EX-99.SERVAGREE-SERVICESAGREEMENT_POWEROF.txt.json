This creates uncertainty regarding the enforceability of obligations under equitable principles.",

                "explanation": "Changing the exception from \"gross negligence or willful misconduct\" to \"ordinary negligence\" significantly expands the scope of indemnification. This conflicts with standard interpretations of indemnification clauses, which typically exclude coverage for an indemnitee's own negligence. Ordinary negligence has a defined legal meaning, and indemnifying against it could be deemed against public policy in some jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the governing law clause to rely on the \"spirit\" of the law introduces significant uncertainty. Contracts are typically interpreted based on the letter of the law, not subjective interpretations. Adding \"selective reference to principles of conflicts of laws\" further undermines the predictability of the governing law, making it difficult to determine which state's laws will apply in a dispute. The original text is rooted in established principles for legal proceedings.",

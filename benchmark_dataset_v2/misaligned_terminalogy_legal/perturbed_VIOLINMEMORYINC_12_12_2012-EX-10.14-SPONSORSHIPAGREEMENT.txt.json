                "original_text": "(a) \"Affiliate\" means a person or entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, a Party. The term 'control' means the possession of the power to direct the management and policies of the person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "(a) \"Affiliate\" means any individual or organization connected in some way to a Party. The term 'control' means influence, regardless of legal ownership or formal agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' adheres to standard corporate law definitions, emphasizing control through ownership or contractual arrangements. The modified definition broadens the term to include any 'individual or organization connected in some way' and redefines 'control' as mere 'influence,' regardless of legal basis. This contradicts established legal interpretations of 'affiliate' and 'control,' creating ambiguity and potentially unenforceable terms.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration under specific rules and location. The modified clause gives Forty Niners SC unilateral control over dispute resolution, contradicting the concept of mutually agreed arbitration and potentially violating principles of fair contract law.",

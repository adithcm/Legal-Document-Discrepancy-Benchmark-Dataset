                "original_text": "\"Add-On Software Modules\" means those computer software programs that (a) provide additional functionality and may be integrated with the existing Hardware and other Software, (b) may be legally exported to the Territory without any export license and (c) WGT elects to include in Exhibit A at a mutually agreed discount percentage.",
                "changed_text": "\"Add-On Software Modules\" means those software components that may enhance functionality, and may or may not integrate with existing hardware or other software. Exportability and inclusion in Exhibit A are at the sole discretion of WGT and subject to future agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces specific criteria for add-on software modules with vague terms, creating uncertainty. Exportability is now discretionary, contradicting export regulations.",

Distributor will not represent or\n     hold itself out as an employee, agent or franchisee of WGT. Distributor\n     does not have any authority to, and will not, create or assume any license,\n     warranty or other obligation, express or implied, on behalf of WGT. This\n     Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as creating or evidencing\n     any association, joint venture or partnership between the parties or as\n     imposing any partnership or franchisor obligation or liability on either\n     party.",

Distributor has the authority to create obligations on behalf of WGT, but WGT has the right to refuse the action afterward. This Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as creating or evidencing any partnership.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'independent entity' and granting authority to create obligations contradicts the definition of an independent contractor, potentially blurring the line between contractor and agent under agency law. The line is blurred even more by introducing retroactive rights.",

WGT will permit Distributor and end-users purchasing\n     through resellers to return any defective Product in accordance with the\n     limited warranty contained in the applicable end-user license agreement or\n     limited hardware warranty, as applicable, provided that the Distributor and\n     end-user have compiled with the applicable warranty terms and conditions.\n     In order to receive the remedy provided for hereunder, Distributor shall\n     deliver to WGT a sample of the Product which Distributor finds to be\n     defective in workmanship or materials, or damaged in shipment prior to\n     Distributor assuming the risk of loss or damage , along with a written\n     explanation of the alleged defect within thirty (30) days from the later of\n     Distributor's initial receipt of such Product from WGT or from the delivery\n     of such Product to an end-user.",

                "original_text": "1.2 \"Adverse Event\" shall mean any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who is administered the Product, but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment for which the Product is used. An \"Adverse Event\" can include any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the Product, whether or not related to the Product. A pre-existing condition that worsened in severity after administration of the Product would be considered an \"Adverse Event\".",
                "changed_text": "1.2 \"Adverse Event\" shall mean any medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who is administered the Product. An \"Adverse Event\" only includes unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms, or diseases definitively caused by the use of the Product, as confirmed through rigorous scientific analysis. A pre-existing condition that worsens in severity after administration of the Product will not be considered an \"Adverse Event\" unless direct causation is proven.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a legal contradiction by narrowing the definition of \"Adverse Event.\" The original definition aligns with standard pharmacovigilance practices which include any temporally associated event, regardless of causality. The changed definition requires definitive proof of causation, conflicting with FDA and international guidelines for adverse event reporting. This impacts reporting obligations and potentially hides safety signals.",

In addition, Dova shall, and shall require all of its sales representatives to, comply in all respects with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",

In addition, Dova shall, and shall require all of its sales representatives to, mostly comply with Applicable Laws in connection with its promotion of the Product in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires compliance \"in all respects\" with Applicable Laws, a standard and legally enforceable obligation. The revised text weakens this obligation to \"generally comply\" and \"mostly comply,\" creating ambiguity. This contradicts the legal requirement for full compliance with laws like the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it unclear what level of non-compliance is acceptable and harder to enforce.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the legal standard of the representation from a factual statement of compliance (\"in all material respects\") to a subjective belief and aspirational statement (“believes it is largely in compliance” and “trying its best”). It weakens the enforceability of the warranty, because beliefs and best efforts are harder to prove than actual compliance. This introduces uncertainty regarding adherence to regulations like the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare compliance laws.",

Physicians are provided with a secure HIPPA compliant transport account(s), similar to e-mail with attachments, that enable them to share patient specific personal health information with other participating physicians.",

Physicians are provided with a transport account(s), that enable them to share patient information with other participating physicians.",
                "explanation": "By removing 'HIPAA compliant' and 'personal' relating to health information, the modified text contradicts HIPAA's strict requirements for handling protected health information (PHI). This creates uncertainty as to whether the platform adheres to federal health information privacy laws.",

NCB appoints NPC, and NPC agrees to serve, as NCB's sole agent (i) to provide authorization, processing and settlement services with respect to Visa and MasterCard transactions (\"Merchant Processing Services\") to merchants who desire to receive Merchant Processing Services from NCB or NPC (\"Merchants\") and (ii) to enter into contracts with merchants (\"Merchant Contracts\") for the provision of Merchant Processing Services as agent of NCB; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit NPC's right to provide, as agent for other members of Visa and MasterCard, Merchant Processing Services to merchants who desire to receive such services from NCB or others.",

NCB appoints NPC, and NPC agrees to serve, as NCB's ostensible agent (i) to provide authorization, processing and settlement services with respect to Visa and MasterCard transactions (\"Merchant Processing Services\") to merchants who desire to receive Merchant Processing Services from NCB or NPC (\"Merchants\") and (ii) to enter into contracts with merchants (\"Merchant Contracts\") for the provision of Merchant Processing Services as agent of NCB; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit NPC's right to provide, as agent for other members of Visa and MasterCard, Merchant Processing Services to merchants who desire to receive such services from NCB or others.",
                "explanation": "The term 'sole agent' has been changed to 'ostensible agent.' This introduces a contradiction because an ostensible agent may not have the full authority of a sole agent, creating uncertainty about the scope of NPC's powers and responsibilities under agency law.",

NPC, as agent of NCB, shall be responsible for establishing the terms and conditions of the Merchant Contracts, including all changes thereunder, subject to Section 1.7 below. Without in any way limiting the authority granted in Section 1.1, NCB hereby authorizes NPC to use NCB's name to the extent necessary or appropriate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to enter into and to renew Merchant Contracts, to modify Merchant Contracts to the extent necessary to assign them to NCB, to perform the Merchant Contracts and to take other necessary or appropriate actions with respect to the Merchant Contracts, all in accordance with requirements of Visa and MasterCard.

NPC, as agent of NCB, shall assist in establishing the terms and conditions of the Merchant Contracts, including all changes thereunder, subject to Section 1.7 below. Without in any way limiting the authority granted in Section 1.1, NCB hereby authorizes NPC to use NCB's name to the extent necessary or appropriate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to enter into and to renew Merchant Contracts, to modify Merchant Contracts to the extent necessary to assign them to NCB, to perform the Merchant Contracts and to take other necessary or appropriate actions with respect to the Merchant Contracts, all in accordance with requirements of Visa and MasterCard. As between NPC and NCB, NCB shall be primarily responsible for all credit, fraud and other risks associated with each Merchant Contract.",
                "explanation": "The term 'responsible' has been changed to 'assist' for the first instance. Also, it has been changed to 'primarily responsible' for the last instance. This introduces a contradiction because the agent is supposed to have all the credit, fraud, and other risks, but the changed text introduces uncertainty about the scope of NPC's powers and responsibilities under agency law.",

Each party agrees to hold in confidence and to instruct its employees and agents to hold in confidence all information and materials, in whatever form, reasonably designated as confidential by the party requesting confidentiality. NPC agrees to comply with all laws and regulations relating to confidentiality of customer lists and other information which are applicable to NCB and its agents or to NPC. NCB agrees to comply with all contractual obligations of NPC actually known to NCB and all laws and regulations applicable to NCB or NPC relating to confidentiality of customer lists and other information.",
                "changed_text": "In performing this Agreement, each party will have access to confidential information of the other. Each party agrees to attempt to hold in confidence and to vaguely instruct its employees and agents to hold in confidence all information and materials, in whatever form, loosely designated as confidential by the party requesting confidentiality. NPC agrees to consider complying with some laws and regulations relating to confidentiality of customer lists and other information which are applicable to NCB and its agents or to NPC. NCB agrees to potentially comply with all contractual obligations of NPC vaguely known to NCB and some laws and regulations applicable to NCB or NPC relating to confidentiality of customer lists and other information.",
                "explanation": "The change of words such as 'hold' to 'attempt to hold', 'instruct' to 'vaguely instruct', 'designated' to 'loosely designated', 'agrees to comply' to 'agrees to consider complying', 'actually known' to 'vaguely known', and 'all' to 'some', adds loopholes to the text regarding confidential information, thus making it a contradiction to the law regarding confidentiality and the contract in general. By saying that NPC will attempt to comply with some of the law, that also means that they have the option of not complying with them, which further adds contradiction.",

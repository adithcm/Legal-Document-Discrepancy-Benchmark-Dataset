                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.1      \"AB rated\" means, with respect to any Product (as defined in the          Dovonex(R) Agreement), a pharmaceutical product which is an AB-rated          equivalent to the Product, as defined in the 22nd edition of Approved          Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations issued by the          United States Department of Health and Human Services.",
                "changed_text": "1.1      \"AB rated\" may mean, with respect to any Product (as defined in the          Dovonex(R) Agreement), a pharmaceutical product which is considered by the parties as equivalent to the Product, regardless of any official rating or evaluation by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.",
                "explanation": "The original definition refers to a specific FDA rating (AB-rated) which has a clear legal and regulatory meaning. The modified definition replaces this with a subjective assessment by the parties, contradicting the established regulatory definition and creating uncertainty. It's no longer tied to a definite, regulatory benchmark.",

                "original_text": "1.9      \"Governmental or Regulatory Authority\" means any court, tribunal,          arbitrator, agency, commission, official or other instrumentality of          the United States or any relevant country, state, province, county,          city or other political subdivision.",
                "changed_text": "1.9      \"Governmental or Regulatory Authority\" means any organization that the Parties agree is a Governmental or Regulatory Authority.",
                "explanation": "The original definition provides a specific enumeration of what constitutes a Governmental or Regulatory Authority, referencing established legal entities. The modified definition replaces this with a subjective agreement between the parties. This removes the objective grounding in legal structures and allows for potentially arbitrary designations, conflicting with the intended scope and authority recognized under law. This can lead to conflicts in enforcing regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with all applicable Laws, a legally binding requirement. The modified text replaces 'Laws' with 'internal guidelines,' which are non-legally binding internal policies of the companies. This undermines the legal enforceability of compliance and creates a direct contradiction by replacing statutory requirements with voluntary internal rules.",

The identification number and password used by a Software User          is reusable and reassignable and may be used and transferred by Corio,          in accordance with the licenses granted below, between Customers as one          Customer discontinues the Corio Services and another Customer          subscribes.",

This broad definition allows any person to access the software on a Corio Server. The credentials used by a Software User are non-transferable, and tied to the original subscriber, and cannot be reused.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a 'named user' with assigned credentials, implying controlled access. The modified definition broadens this to 'any individual,' removing the 'named' aspect and contradicting the notion of controlled, credential-based access, which would be important for compliance in areas like data security and user accountability under laws like GDPR if personal data is involved.",

                "explanation": "The original definition ties updates to specific numeric identifier changes, providing a clear and objective criterion. The modified version makes update availability and communication discretionary, conflicting with standard software maintenance definitions that imply a reasonable level of consistency and notification.",

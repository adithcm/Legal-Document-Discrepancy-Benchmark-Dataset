                "original_text": "The Parties expressly understand and agree that Operator is acting and shall perform and execute the provisions of this Agreement as an independent contractor unrelated to Owner or any Owner Affiliate, and the work performed by Operator hereunder shall be subject to Owner's general right of inspection and approval. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a relationship, expressed or implied, of employer- employee or principal-agent between Owner and Operator or between Owner and any individual employed or provided to work hereunder by Operator.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties expressly understand and agree that Operator is acting and shall perform and execute the provisions of this Agreement as a general contractor related to Owner, and the work performed by Operator hereunder shall be subject to Owner's comprehensive right of control and direction. This Agreement is intended to create a relationship, expressed or implied, of employer- employee or principal-agent between Owner and Operator or between Owner and any individual employed or provided to work hereunder by Operator.",
                "explanation": "By changing “independent contractor” to “general contractor”, and establishing a comprehensive right of control, the contract now implies an employer-employee relationship, which is a direct contradiction. The addition of language stating that the agreement is intended to create a relationship of employer-employee strengthens this contradiction.",

                "changed_text": "Operator shall endeavor to comply with Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits to the best of its abilities.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict compliance with Environmental Laws and Permits. The modified text introduces ambiguity by requiring Operator to only “endeavor to comply” and qualify compliance with \"to the best of its abilities\". This undermines the mandatory nature of environmental regulations and shifts the responsibility from strict adherence to a subjective standard, this creates ambiguity which directly contradicts the intent and requirement of Environmental Laws, which require strict compliance.",

                "original_text": "If either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, other than the obligation to indemnify and to make payments then or thereafter due hereunder, upon such Party giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure in writing to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible after the occurrence of the cause relied on, then the obligations of the Party giving such notice, so far as they are affected by such Force Majeure, will be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no longer period, and such cause must as far as possible be remedied with all reasonable and diligent dispatch by the Party claiming such in order to put itself in a position to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "If either Party deems itself unable, wholly or in part, by any reason whatsoever to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, including the obligation to indemnify and to make payments then or thereafter due hereunder, upon such Party self-reporting its reasoning in writing to the other Party, then the obligations of the Party giving such notice will be suspended indefinitely. There is no requirement to remedy such cause.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines Force Majeure as an event outside a party's control that prevents them from fulfilling obligations. The modified clause allows any reason whatsoever to be claimed as cause and suspends obligations indefinitely, including financial ones, contradicting the standard legal understanding of Force Majeure as a temporary suspension due to extraordinary events. Moreover, the original force majeure clause states the inability “must as far as possible be remedied with all reasonable and diligent dispatch by the Party claiming such in order to put itself in a position to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.” The new clause does not require it.",

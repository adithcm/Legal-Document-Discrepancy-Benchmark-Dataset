Nothing contained herein or any document executed in connection herewith, shall be construed to create an employer-employee, partnership or joint venture relationship between VNUE and Promoter. Promoter is an independent contractor and not an officer, director, affiliate, insider, employee or agent of VNUE or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Promoter has no authority to, and will not, enter into contracts, make representations, warranties or commitments purporting to be binding on VNUE or otherwise act on VNUE's behalf and shall not take any action that might lead third parties to believe Promoter has the right to do so.",
                "changed_text": "Independent Contractor. Nothing contained herein or any document executed in connection herewith, shall be construed to create an employer-employee, partnership or joint venture relationship between VNUE and Promoter. Promoter is an independent contractor, but may be considered an agent of VNUE for specific promotional activities. Promoter is not an officer, director, affiliate, insider, employee of VNUE or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Promoter has the limited authority to enter into contracts, make representations, warranties or commitments purporting to be binding on VNUE or otherwise act on VNUE's behalf and shall not take any action that might lead third parties to believe Promoter has the right to do so.",
                "explanation": "By stating the Promoter 'may be considered an agent' and 'has the limited authority to enter into contracts,' the contract contradicts the initial statement that the Promoter is an 'independent contractor'. This creates ambiguity around the Promoter's legal status and liability, potentially violating Nevada agency law, which distinguishes between agents and independent contractors based on control and authority.",

Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred. Reimbursement, if any, will be determined at the end of the contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that VNUE 'shall' reimburse expenses, creating an obligation. The modified text replaces 'shall' with 'may, at its sole discretion', removing the obligation to reimburse. This introduces a contradiction and uncertainty in the expense reimbursement, potentially conflicting with principles of contract law regarding consideration and good faith.",

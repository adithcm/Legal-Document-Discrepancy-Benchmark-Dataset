As used in this Section 1.1, the word \"control\" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms \"controlled by\" or \"under the common control with\") shall mean the actual power, either directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, whether by the ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting share capital in such person, corporation, or other entity, or by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" of a Party means any person, corporation or other entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Party, as the case may be. As used in this Section 1.1, the word \"control\" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms \"controlled by\" or \"under the common control with\") shall mean the perceived power, either directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, to influence the direction of the management and policies of such entity, whether by suggestion or influence of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting share capital in such person, corporation, or other entity, or by contract or otherwise.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'control' is weakened by changing 'actual power to direct' to 'perceived power to influence,' and by changing 'direct or cause the direction of' to 'influence the direction of', conflicting with standard legal interpretations of control. This creates uncertainty about the level of influence required for affiliation under corporate law.",

                "explanation": "Removing the word 'maintaining' from the phrase 'obtaining and maintaining Marketing Approvals' reduces Ono's implicit due diligence responsibilities to sustain regulatory compliance.

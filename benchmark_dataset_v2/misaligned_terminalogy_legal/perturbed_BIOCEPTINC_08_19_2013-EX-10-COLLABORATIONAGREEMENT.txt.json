                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" shall mean any company or entity associated with a party hereto and shall include any company whose stock is partially owned by a party.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" specifies a control threshold (more than 50% ownership). The modified definition removes this threshold and introduces the vague term \"associated with,\" creating uncertainty. This contradicts standard corporate law definitions of affiliate, which typically involve significant control.",

(vii) the administrative False Claims Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(a)) (viii) the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. § 1320d et seq.), (ix) the exclusion laws (x) SSA § 1128 (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7) (xi) Medicare (Title XVIII of the Social Security Act), (xii) Medicaid (Title XIX of the Social Security Act); (xiii) the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act of 1988 (CLIA); and (xiv) data security, protection and privacy laws in the applicable jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "The original definition lists specific federal statutes and regulations, grounding the agreement in established legal frameworks. The modified definition replaces this with a subjective standard (\"rules and guidelines that the parties deem important\"), contradicting the legally binding nature of statutory law. This change eliminates any reference to federal statutes, such as HIPAA, the Stark Law, and the False Claims Act, thus misaligning the agreement with established legal requirements.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates that both parties possess and maintain all required licenses and certifications, specifying examples like CLIA certification. The modified version weakens this obligation to a noncommittal 'try to obtain' and removes mentions of CLIA certification and FDA registration, thus significantly weakening the legal requirements.

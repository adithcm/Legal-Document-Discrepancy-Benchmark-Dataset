                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Except of taxes associated with Kubient's income, Customer shall be responsible for paying all applicable sales, use or other taxes, duties, or tariffs applicable to its use of the Services.",
                "changed_text": "Except of taxes associated with Kubient's income, Customer may be responsible for paying taxes on the usage of service, based on Kubient's assessment.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be responsible' to 'may be responsible' and adding 'based on Kubient's assessment', we introduce uncertainty and contradict the standard legal expectation that tax liabilities are defined by law, not a service provider's discretion. This misaligns with established tax laws that dictate how sales and use taxes are applied.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party submits for all disputes to the jurisdiction of courts convenient to Kubient, unless otherwise negotiated.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the fixed jurisdiction of New York courts to a jurisdiction determined by Kubient's convenience, undermining the principle of mutual agreement and fairness in jurisdiction clauses. This contradicts standard legal practices that ensure both parties have a reasonable and predictable forum for resolving disputes.",

                "original_text": "Confidential Information' means any tangible and intangible non-public information in any form (including written information, oral statements and electronically stored data) which a party discloses (the 'Discloser') to the other party (the 'Recipient') including, without limitation, information relating to trade secrets, systems, know-how, products, processes (including manufacturing processes), inventions, computer software programs, marketing or sales techniques, financial condition, costs, business interests, initiatives, objectives, plans, strategies, customers, suppliers, lenders, underwriters, or employees, that is marked as confidential or identified at the time of disclosure as being confidential or is otherwise disclosed under circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that such information is confidential, excluding information that: (a) was in Recipient's possession before receipt from the Discloser pursuant this Agreement; (b) is in or enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party who was not known by Recipient to be legally or contractually restricted from disclosing such information; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to the Discloser's Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means any information a party chooses to treat as confidential, as determined by that party at their sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, business plans, customer lists, and product roadmaps. The following is excluded from Confidential Information: (a) Information already known to the recipient, (b) Information that becomes publicly available, and (c) Information obtained from a third party.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' relies on industry standards and reasonable expectations of confidentiality. The modified version gives a single party unilateral control over defining what constitutes confidential information, irrespective of industry norms or reasonableness. It removes the requirement for information to be 'non-public' at the time of disclosure and eliminates the necessity for information to be 'marked as confidential', thus conflicting with established legal understandings of trade secrets and confidential information protection. This introduces significant ambiguity and could lead to the unintended classification of publicly available data as confidential.",

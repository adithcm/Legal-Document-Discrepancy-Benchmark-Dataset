                "changed_text": "(j) \"Winning Bid Price\" means the price at which the Auction Platform awards Impressions to a bidding party which can be determined at Kubient's discretion, irrespective of any minimum price Customer has suggested.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard auction practices and the general understanding of how bid prices are determined. By stating that the winning bid price can be determined at Kubient's discretion, regardless of the minimum price agreed upon, the term 'Winning Bid Price' deviates from its common meaning and creates uncertainty in enforcement. This could allow Kubient to set prices arbitrarily, contrary to the expectations of the Customer. The customer may expect to be able to determine a lower bound for the bid, which it is not in this case.",

                "original_text": "12. Confidentiality. \"Confidential Information\" means any tangible and intangible non-public information in any form (including written information, oral statements and electronically stored data) which a party discloses (the \"Discloser\") to the other party (the \"Recipient\") including, without limitation, information relating to trade secrets, systems, know-how, products, processes (including manufacturing processes), inventions, computer software programs, marketing or sales techniques, financial condition, costs, business interests, initiatives, objectives, plans, strategies, customers, suppliers, lenders, underwriters, or employees, that is marked as confidential or identified at the time of disclosure as being confidential or is otherwise disclosed under circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that such information is confidential, excluding information that: (a) was in Recipient's possession before receipt from the Discloser pursuant this Agreement; (b) is in or enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party who was not known by Recipient to be legally or contractually restricted from disclosing such information; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to the Discloser's Confidential Information.",
                "changed_text": "12. Confidentiality. \"Confidential Information\" means any information a party chooses to keep private. This includes, but is not limited to, information relating to trade secrets, systems, know-how, products, processes (including manufacturing processes), inventions, computer software programs, marketing or sales techniques, financial condition, costs, business interests, initiatives, objectives, plans, strategies, customers, suppliers, lenders, underwriters, or employees. This definition applies regardless of whether the information is marked as confidential, identified as such at the time of disclosure, or could reasonably be considered confidential. There are no exclusions to this definition.",
                "explanation": "This modification broadens the definition of 'Confidential Information' and removes standard exceptions, conflicting with established legal norms regarding what constitutes confidential information. Under common law and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), information already in the public domain or independently developed is generally not considered confidential. By eliminating these exceptions and stating all information a party keeps private is confidential, the clause becomes overly broad and potentially unenforceable. It can lead to disputes about what information falls under confidentiality, regardless of its nature or prior availability.",

Each Party hereby irrevocably submits for all disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New York, New York.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws that Kubient deems appropriate. Each Party hereby submits for all disputes to the jurisdiction and venue of the court closest to Kubient's headquarters.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies Delaware law as governing and designates New York courts for jurisdiction. The modified clause replaces these with 'laws that Kubient deems appropriate' and the 'court closest to Kubient's headquarters,' creating significant legal uncertainty. This contradicts fundamental principles of contract law, which require clear governing law and jurisdiction clauses. The phrase 'laws that Kubient deems appropriate' is vague and unenforceable, while the jurisdictional clause could lead to unfair forum selection, violating basic principles of fairness and due process. The Delaware Law has rules that both entities can use for cases and there is no mention of how Kubient gets to decide which laws are implemented in this case. ",

                "original_text": "1.1  \"Customer\" means a person or entity that has acquired, or has indicated its      interest in acquiring from Licensee, or from a Redistributor if so      specified herein, a non-exclusive and nontransferable Sublicense to use one      (1) or more of the Licensed Products.",
                "changed_text": "1.1  \"Customer\" means a person or entity that expresses interest in the Licensed Products. The actual acquisition of a Sublicense does not define customer status.",
                "explanation": "The original definition requires actual acquisition or indication of acquiring a sublicense. The modified definition broadens the term 'Customer' to include anyone who simply expresses interest, regardless of whether they obtain a sublicense. This introduces a contradiction as it redefines a legally significant term (Customer) in a way that may not align with typical legal interpretations regarding software licensing and end-user agreements.",

                "changed_text": "1.4  \"Licensed Product\" means object code available to the licensee or any software the licensee deems falls under this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that the Licensed Product is tied to the software listed in EXHIBIT A. The altered definition introduces ambiguity, allowing the Licensee to include any software they decide falls under the agreement, regardless of whether it's listed in EXHIBIT A or provided by the Licensor. This is a legal contradiction of the original contract, which would be hard to enforce in court.",

                "changed_text": "1.10 \"Upgrade\" means any modification, adaptation or version update of a Licensed Product whether or not this enhancement or upgrade improves any part of the existing licensed software. Distribution of the upgrade is optional.",
                "explanation": "The original definition ties 'Upgrade' to enhancements offered by the Licensor to registered users. The changed definition expands 'Upgrade' to include any version update, regardless of whether it enhances the product or if the Licensor ever distributes the upgrade. The definition of an upgrade is legally significant as it affects licensing terms and support obligations. If an 'upgrade' does not enhance the original product, the original agreement does not apply.",

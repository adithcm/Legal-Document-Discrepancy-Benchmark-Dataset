                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Territory\" shall mean the geographical area under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Republic of India.",
                "changed_text": "\"Territory\" shall mean the general vicinity of the factory in Delhi.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines \"Territory\" as the entire Republic of India. The modified text narrows the definition to a specific location, which introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial intention of applying the agreement nationally. This can lead to legal disputes over the scope of the agreement.",

                "changed_text": "All costs, fees, and expenses for the JVC shall be paid by MIL and may or may not be reimbursed, subject to the sole discretion of MIL.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that all 'reasonable' costs will be reimbursed after ratification by the board. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating reimbursement is at 'sole discretion' of MIL, potentially contradicting the principle of fairness and mutual benefit expected in joint ventures. This is misaligned since in the original text, there is a requirement to pay that cost, and it is not dependent on the party's sole discretion.",

Provided, however, that in the event the termination of this Agreement is followed by a sale of all of the shares held by IMPCO in the JVC to MINDA/MIL, the JVC will have a right to continue to use the Technical Know How already received and absorbed on the condition that royalty payments under the TAA have been paid by the JVC to IMPCO or will be paid, as the case may be, for a minimum period of five (5) years, as provided in the TAA.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires royalties be paid in a termination where one party buys out another, but the modified text makes the royalty payments optional and the period undetermined which is a misaligned term.",

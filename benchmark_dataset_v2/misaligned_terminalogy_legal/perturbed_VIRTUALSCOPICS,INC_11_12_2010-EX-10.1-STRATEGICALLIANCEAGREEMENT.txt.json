                "original_text": "VS shall perform all Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor and not as an employee, partner or agent of PPD. As such, VS shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, payroll deductions and similar items associated with compensation for its services under this Agreement as may be required by applicable law. VS acknowledges that as an independent contractor it will not be entitled to insurance or other benefits made available to employees of PPD.",
                "changed_text": "VS shall perform all Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor and not as an employee, partner or agent of PPD. As such, PPD shall handle all tax obligations, payroll deductions, and similar items associated with compensation for its services under this Agreement as may be required by applicable law. VS acknowledges that as an independent contractor it will be entitled to insurance and other benefits made available to employees of PPD.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts the standard definition of an 'independent contractor' under US labor laws and IRS regulations. Independent contractors are responsible for their own taxes and are not typically entitled to employee benefits. By stating that PPD will handle taxes and VS is entitled to benefits, the contract blurs the line between an independent contractor and an employee, creating uncertainty about the worker's classification and potential legal challenges.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state where VirtualScopics, Inc. is headquartered, disregarding any established legal precedents.",
                "explanation": "This contradicts standard legal practice by replacing 'State of Delaware' with a reference to the company's headquarters state (New York), adding, 'disregarding any established legal precedents.' It's misaligned because it introduces ambiguity regarding the controlling law and invalidates conflict of laws principles, potentially leading to jurisdictional disputes and the application of inappropriate legal standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard contract law principles regarding choice of law and conflict of laws; established case law.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement, without cause, upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party, provided, however, that all outstanding Work Orders shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions hereof. Either party may terminate this Agreement, or a relevant Work Order, immediately, upon the occurrence of any of the following for cause events: (a) either party's material breach of the commitments set forth in Section 3; (b) either party commences a voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or an involuntary case or proceeding is commenced against a party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; (c) significant audit findings are identified by the other party, a Sponsor, or an applicable regulatory authority; or (d) significant operational deficiencies that are not resolved in accordance with the Steering Committee determinations following escalation.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement, without explanation, effective immediately, irrespective of any existing Work Orders. A party may terminate this Agreement, or a relevant Work Order, upon personal dissatisfaction, which is determined at their own discretion without needing external validation.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces 'ninety (90) days prior written notice' with immediate termination and replaces specific 'for cause' events with subjective 'personal dissatisfaction'. This directly contradicts established contract law principles that require reasonable notice for termination without cause and objective standards for termination for cause, introducing unenforceability.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles related to termination clauses and the requirement of good faith.",

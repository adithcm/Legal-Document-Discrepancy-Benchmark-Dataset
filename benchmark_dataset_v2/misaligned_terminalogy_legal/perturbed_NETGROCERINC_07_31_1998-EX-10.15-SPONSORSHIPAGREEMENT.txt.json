                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as any link to the NetGrocer Site, whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and text, served by Excite to a user as part of an HTML page, part of the Excite's Internet chat service or part of search results displayed in \"Excite Shopping Service powered by Jango\".",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, an \"Impression\" is defined as a potential opportunity for a user to view a link to the NetGrocer Site, regardless of whether the link is actually displayed or viewable, and regardless of its format or placement.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Impression' clearly states that it must be 'served by Excite to a user'. The modified definition changes it to a 'potential opportunity', creating a contradiction. This misalignment could allow Excite to claim impressions even if the links were not actually viewable by users, affecting NetGrocer's obligation to pay based on impressions and click-through rates, which are related to impressions.",

                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"Click-through\" occurs when a user activates the link to the NetGrocer Site (the address or addresses of which are provided by NetGrocer for such Impression) contained in an Impression and (i) the activation of the link to the NetGrocer Site is recorded by Excite's servers or (ii) in the case of \"Try These First\" links only, until Excite has the technical capability to count the activation of \"Try These First\" links to the NetGrocer Site, the user is referred to the NetGrocer Site through the activation of a \"Try These First' link and the referral is recorded by NetGrocer's servers.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, a \"Click-through\" occurs when a user potentially attempts to activate a link to the NetGrocer Site. This will be assumed upon any user action, such as any mouse movement, on the page where the link is located.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Click-through' requires actual activation and recording by servers. The modified version broadens it to any attempt or assumed attempt based on user behavior, which directly contradicts the original. This means Excite could claim click-throughs without actual clicks, affecting NetGrocer's payment obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original definition has specific conditions for information to be excluded from 'Confidential Information', such as lawful receipt from a third party without breach of obligation. The modified version loosens these conditions significantly, making it more vague and subjective. Using public search engines and thinking they knew are not lawful reasons to disclose information.",

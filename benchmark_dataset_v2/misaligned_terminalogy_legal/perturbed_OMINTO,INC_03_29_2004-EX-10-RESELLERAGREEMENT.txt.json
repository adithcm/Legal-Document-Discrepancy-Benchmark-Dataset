                "changed_text": "The laws of the country of Freedonia shall govern this Agreement, without reference to conflicts of law provisions.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to 'Freedonia' when no such country exists creates a conflict. Contracts are generally governed by the laws of a recognized jurisdiction. This renders the clause uncertain and potentially unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "Resellers are expected to actively market and promote MediaNet Group Technologies Software to their existing customer base and visitors to their web site. Promotion by newsletters and e-mail to customers is encouraged, but we do not encourage spam e-mail and hence specifically ask resellers not to promote MediaNet Group Technologies Software or Applications via unsolicited e-mail.",

Promotion by newsletters and e-mail to customers is required, including sending unsolicited spam e-mail, to promote MediaNet Group Technologies Software or Applications.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts established legal precedents and federal laws like the CAN-SPAM Act, which prohibits unsolicited commercial email. Mandating spam email creates a legal contradiction within the contract and exposes the reseller to legal risks.",

The Disclosing party holds no obligation to provide information about what is or is not confidential.",
                "explanation": "The change adds uncertainty regarding the definition and identification of confidential information. It creates a situation where the disclosing party can arbitrarily refuse to clarify what constitutes confidential information, leading to disputes and making the confidentiality clause less enforceable.",

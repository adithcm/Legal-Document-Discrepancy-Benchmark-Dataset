                "explanation": "Changing 'Gateway Page' to 'Entry Page' creates ambiguity. 'Gateway Page' has a generally understood meaning in web agreements, referring to an initial access point. 'Entry Page' is less specific and could be interpreted differently, leading to disputes about which page the terms apply to. This would contradict standard practices and introduce legal uncertainty. Additionally, this affects other sections where the term is used, creating a conflict.",

If Women.com proposes to create and make available Diet Promos after the Effective Date, it shall give eDiets written notice of its intention, describing the terms and conditions of participation in the Diet Promos. eDiets shall have fifteen (15) days from the giving of such notice to agree to participate in the applicable Diet Promo upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice of its agreement to Women.com.",

If Women.com proposes to create and make available Diet Promos after the Effective Date, it shall give eDiets written notice of its intention, describing the terms and conditions of participation in the Diet Promos. eDiets shall have fifteen (15) days from the giving of such notice to agree to participate in the applicable Diet Promo upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice of its agreement to Women.com.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'right of first refusal' with 'preferential consideration' significantly weakens eDiets' position. 'Right of first refusal' is a legally recognized term creating a clear obligation. 'Preferential consideration' is vague and subjective, allowing Women.com to potentially offer the opportunity to others even if eDiets expresses interest. This creates a legal contradiction by misrepresenting the strength of eDiets' entitlement, and contradicting standard contract definitions.",

                "explanation": "Changing \"reasonable evidence\" to \"alleges with some proof\" weakens the standard of proof required by the disclosing party. Legally, 'reasonable evidence' suggests a degree of objectivity and verifiability. 'Alleges with some proof' is more subjective and could be satisfied with minimal or unsubstantiated claims. This change contradicts the established legal understanding of proving exceptions to confidentiality, potentially undermining the confidentiality provisions of the contract, since, the receiving party can make a unsubstantiated claim about the information.",

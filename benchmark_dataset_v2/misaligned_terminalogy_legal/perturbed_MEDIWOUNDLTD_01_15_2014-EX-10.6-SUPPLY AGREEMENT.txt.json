                "original_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" means any firm, person or company which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a party to this Agreement and for the purpose of this definition the term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such firm, person or company whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise or the ownership either directly or indirectly of 20% (twenty percent) or more of the voting securities of such firm, person or company.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Affiliate\" means any firm, person or company which has a business relationship with a party to this Agreement and for the purpose of this definition the term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly of the power to influence the management and policies of such firm, person or company whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise or the ownership either directly or indirectly of 5% (five percent) or more of the voting securities of such firm, person or company.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Affiliate\" relies on a clear definition of 'control' involving the power to 'direct or cause the direction of the management and policies' and a minimum ownership threshold of 20%. By changing \"controls, is controlled by or is under common control\" to \"has a business relationship\" and changing the term 'direct or cause the direction' to influence, as well as reducing the ownership threshold to 5% introduces ambiguity and contradicts standard legal interpretations of 'affiliate' under corporate law. This creates uncertainty regarding which entities are bound by the Affiliate's obligations under the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates adherence to specific, well-defined standards like GACP and cGMP, which are legally recognized benchmarks for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Replacing 'GACP (Good Agricultural and Collection Practice) and cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) standards, ISO 22000 and all other applicable laws and regulations' with 'general industry practices and basic manufacturing guidelines, ISO 9001 and all other applicable local guidelines' introduces vague language. \"General industry practices\" and \"basic manufacturing guidelines\" lack the specificity of cGMP, creating a loophole. Furthermore, replacing ISO 22000 with ISO 9001 weakens the required standard as ISO 22000 is specific to food safety management while ISO 9001 is a more generic quality management system.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the substantive laws of New York, providing a clear and legally enforceable choice of law. By changing this to \"general principles of commercial law, with reference to the laws of New York only as a non-binding guide,\" the governing law becomes ambiguous. 'General principles of commercial law' is a vague term, and the reference to New York law as 'non-binding' undermines the enforceability of the contract under a specific legal framework. This introduces significant uncertainty about which laws apply and how disputes will be resolved.",

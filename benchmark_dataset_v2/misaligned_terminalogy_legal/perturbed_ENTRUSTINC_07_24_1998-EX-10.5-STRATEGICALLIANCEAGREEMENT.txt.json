                "changed_text": "\"Subsidiary\" shall mean: (i) a corporation, company or other entity, in which a ---------- Party now or hereafter, owns or controls, directly or indirectly, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares or securities (representing the right to vote for the election of directors or other managing authority), provided, however, that such corporation, company, or other entity shall be deemed to be a Subsidiary only so long as such ownership or control exists; or (ii) an entity which does not have outstanding shares or securities, as may be the case in a partnership, joint venture or unincorporated association, but in which a Party now or hereafter, owns or controls, directly or indirectly, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the ownership interest representing the right to make the decisions for such entity, provided, however, that such entity shall be deemed to be a Subsidiary only so long as such ownership or control exists.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Subsidiary' requires a 50% or more ownership or control. Changing this to 25% directly contradicts standard corporate law definitions and creates ambiguity regarding which entities are considered subsidiaries under the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'irrevocable' to 'revocable' fundamentally alters the nature of the license granted.

International comity is a doctrine of deference, not a defined body of law.

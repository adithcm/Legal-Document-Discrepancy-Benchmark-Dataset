                "explanation": "Changing 'Soil and Water Conservation Plan' to 'Soil and Water Management Plan' introduces ambiguity. While seemingly similar, 'conservation' has specific regulatory definitions related to environmental protection and resource management. 'Management' is broader and lacks the same legal weight, potentially leading to disputes about the required level of environmental stewardship.",

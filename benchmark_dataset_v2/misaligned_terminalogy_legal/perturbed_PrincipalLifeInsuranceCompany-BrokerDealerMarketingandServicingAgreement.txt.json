                "original_text": "Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to train and instruct its Registered\nRepresentatives not to make recommendations to an applicant to purchase an Annuity Contract in the\nabsence of reasonable grounds to believe that the purchase is suitable for such applicant, in accordance\nwith the suitability and disclosure requirements of the 1934 Act, FINRA Conduct Rule 2310, and any\nstate insurance law or regulation governing the offer and sale of Annuity Contracts, including any state\nlaw or regulation governing sales to the public in general (e.g. consumer protection laws or regulations,\nunfair trade practices, annuity disclosure regulations, etc.) or to senior citizens, as the same may be\namended or interpreted from time to time. Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to\ndetermine that each transaction is completed with a Registered Representative's report indicating\nsuitability, including any required and necessary customer information, and is subjected to a review\nprocess in compliance with FINRA Conduct Rule 3010, as the same may be amended or interpreted\nfrom time to time. Each application shall be approved by one of Broker Dealer's registered principals, in\naccordance with all applicable FINRA rules.",
                "changed_text": "Broker Dealer may, at its discretion, train and instruct its Registered\nRepresentatives to make recommendations to an applicant to purchase an Annuity Contract without necessarily establishing grounds that the purchase is suitable for such applicant. Broker Dealer will use commercially reasonable efforts to\ndetermine that each transaction is completed and subjected to a review process in compliance with FINRA Conduct Rule 3010. Each application should be reviewed, but is not required to be approved by one of Broker Dealer's registered principals.",
                "explanation": "The original text aligns with FINRA Rule 2310, mandating reasonable grounds for suitability in annuity recommendations. The modified text introduces discretion and removes the firm obligation that recommendations must be based on suitability, contradicting FINRA's requirement. Removing the requirement of the application to be approved by a registered principal makes it uncertain if FINRA rules will be followed.",

                "explanation": "The original clause strictly prohibits the use and disclosure of confidential information. The modified version allows for the use and disclosure if the Broker Dealer deems it beneficial, thereby contradicting the strict confidentiality required.

If the contract owner requests a change in the servicing agent or if we decide that a change would be in the best\ninterests of the contract owner, trail commissions will be paid to the new servicing agent or his/her broker dealer where appropriate.\nNo trail commissions are paid after termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The trail commission may be paid to the current servicing agent of record provided the Annuity Contract is still in effect.\nServicing agent means the broker dealer or Registered Representative initially assigned to the contract owner.\nIf the contract owner requests a change in the servicing agent or if we decide that a change would be in the best\ninterests of the contract owner, trail commissions may be paid to the new servicing agent or his/her broker dealer where appropriate.\nNo trail commissions are paid after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By replacing “is paid” with “may be paid,” this modification introduces uncertainty and conflicts with the expectation of a consistent commission structure. Also, the original definition specifies that the servicing agent is \"accepted by the contract owner\". Changing to 'initially assigned to the contract owner\" removes the agency component and creates an uncertainty about which agent will receive commissions.",

                "explanation": "The terms 'Person' and 'Entity' have specific meanings under securities laws and regulations, particularly regarding reporting obligations. Changing 'Person' to 'Entity' introduces ambiguity, as 'Entity' could be interpreted more broadly and may not trigger the same reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This ambiguity creates a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'Affiliate' with 'Subsidiary' and 'Branch' in different instances creates a contradiction. An 'Affiliate' has a broad definition in corporate law, while a 'Subsidiary' implies direct control and ownership. 'Branch' implies a separate legal identity. Using these terms interchangeably introduces uncertainty about the legal relationship between Merck Serono SA and Merck KGaA, which is crucial for determining liability and reporting obligations.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'Head of Treasury' to 'Treasury Manager' and 'Head of Capital Markets' to 'Capital Markets Agent' alters the implied authority and responsibility of these individuals. The term 'Head of' typically denotes a senior leadership position with decision-making power, while 'Manager' and 'Agent' suggest more limited roles. This discrepancy can affect the validity of the agreement, as it's unclear if the signatories have the authority to bind the company.",

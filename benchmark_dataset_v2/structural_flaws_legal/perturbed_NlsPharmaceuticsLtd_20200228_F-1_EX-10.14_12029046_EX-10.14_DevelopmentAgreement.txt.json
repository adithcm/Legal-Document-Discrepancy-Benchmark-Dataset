                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the Netherlands, excluding its rules of conflicts of law and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods dated 11 April 1980 (CISG), as amended from time to time. All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present Agreement, including disputes on its conclusion, binding effect, amendment and termination, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules and experienced in the pharmaceutical business. The place of Arbitration shall be in The Hague, Netherlands, or in a place otherwise mutually agreeable. The arbitration shall be conducted in English.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the Netherlands, excluding its rules of conflicts of law and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods dated 11 April 1980 (CISG), as amended from time to time. All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present Agreement, including disputes on its conclusion, binding effect, amendment and termination, shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with conditions agreed by both parties.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific mention of the ICC rules, the appointment of arbitrators, the location of arbitration (The Hague), and the arbitration language (English), the modified text introduces uncertainty about the arbitration process. This makes the clause less enforceable as it lacks the necessary specificity required for a binding arbitration agreement. The added 'conditions agreed by both parties' open the clause to various interpretations, contradicting the purpose of a clear arbitration agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "The Netherlands Arbitration Act requires clear and specific agreement on the method of arbitration.",

                "original_text": "Subject to a written advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days, all relevant records supporting the preparation of the Reports shall be made available during normal business hours for inspection at the expense of Licensor by Licensor or by a selected representative of Licensor for the sole purpose of verifying the Reports and the accuracy of the payments made or due to Licensor under this Agreement. Such inspector shall not request any other documents or information other than these related to this purpose as determined in its sole discretion and the Licensee shall have no obligation to provide the inspector or Licensor any documents or information not related thereto. In the event that any such inspection shows an underreporting and underpayment by the Licensee to Licensor under the terms of this Agreement in excess of one percent (1%) for any twelve-month (12-month) period, then Licensee shall pay the cost of the audit as well as any additional sum that would have been payable to Licensor had the Licensee reported correctly, plus an interest charge at a rate of ten percent (10%) per year. Such interest shall be calculated from the date the correct payment was due to Licensor up to the date when such payment is actually made by the Licensee. For underpayment not in excess of one percent (1%) for any twelve-month (12-month) period, the Licensee shall pay the difference within thirty (30) days without having to pay for the inspection cost but with interest charge calculated as per the provisions of this Article.",
                "changed_text": "Subject to a written advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days, records supporting the preparation of the Reports may be made available. In the event that any inspection shows an underreporting, Licensee may pay any additional sum that would have been payable to Licensor.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'all relevant records shall be made available' to 'records supporting the preparation of the Reports may be made available', the obligation on the Licensee is significantly weakened, creating doubt whether the auditor will be able to gain access to the information. Similarly, switching 'then Licensee shall pay the cost of the audit as well as any additional sum that would have been payable to Licensor' to 'Licensee may pay any additional sum that would have been payable to Licensor' removes the mandatory element for the Licensee to pay for the additional sum, making it optional. The original text required the Licensee to pay the costs of the audit if the underreporting exceeded a threshold, and it required the Licensee to pay an additional sum. Now it just creates an option for the Licensee to pay, which is not enforceable.",

Now it is a recommendation for the Licensee to create the labeling and an option to cooperate, making it difficult for the Licensee to successfully launch the product. Additionally, the regulatory requirements for labeling and packaging exist regardless of this contract, which suggests an intention by the Licensee to breach regulatory requirements.",

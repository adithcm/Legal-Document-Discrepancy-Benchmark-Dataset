THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE\n                ------ -- ---- -----                                              ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.",

                "explanation": "Moving the jury trial waiver to a less prominent section (Other Cooperation) reduces its visibility and enforceability. Altering the original clause to 'unless otherwise agreed upon' introduces an element of ambiguity and contradiction. The initial waiver is unconditional, but the added phrase allows for the possibility of a jury trial if both parties later agree. This reduces the original clause's clarity and may make it more difficult to enforce the waiver in court.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, NTL shall be entitled to sublicense the Entrust Patents to meet its obligations under its existing Patent cross license agreements.  For so long as ETI is an NTL Subsidiary, NTL shall also be entitled, as part of its continuing Patent cross licensing program, to sublicense Entrust Patents under new Patent cross license agreements provided that the rights granted in the Entrust Patents pursuant to any such new Patent cross license agreements do not materially exceed those rights customarily granted under NTL's existing Patent cross license agreements (as of the Effective Date) and ETI obtains the benefit of all Nortel Patents involved.",

For so long as ETI is an NTL Subsidiary, NTL shall also be entitled, as part of its continuing Patent cross licensing program, to sublicense Entrust Patents under new Patent cross license agreements provided that the rights granted in the Entrust Patents pursuant to any such new Patent cross license agreements do not significantly exceed those rights granted under NTL's existing Patent cross license agreements.",
                "explanation": "The relocation of the NTL Right to Cross-License clause introduces confusion. By placing it under 'NTL Technology' (Article II), the applicability of the licensing terms becomes less clear. Furthermore, changing 'materially exceed' to 'significantly exceed' introduces ambiguity. The original clause ensures ETI benefits from Nortel patents, but the modified version removes this requirement. This restructuring makes it harder to determine the precise scope of the cross-licensing agreement and weakens the protections afforded to Entrust.",

                "explanation": "Moving the Limitation on Types of Damages clause from 'Limits of Liability' to a subsection under 'Nortel Use of Entrust Products' greatly reduces its prominence and potentially its applicability to the entire agreement. Further, by removing 'incidental and/or consequential damages resulting from a breach of this agreement, including without limitation lost business, lost savings, and lost profits even if the breaching Party has been advised of the possibility of the occurrence of such damages' and 'Except for breach of Article VIII and for Article XII', we are heavily reducing the context of the damages that the clause applied to. This makes the limitation far narrower and ambiguous, which will introduce great difficulty in enforcing this as a proper limitation of liability.",

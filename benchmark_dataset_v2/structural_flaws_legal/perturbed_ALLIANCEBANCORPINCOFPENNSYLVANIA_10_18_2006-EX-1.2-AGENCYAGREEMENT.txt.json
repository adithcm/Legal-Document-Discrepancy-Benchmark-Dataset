                "original_text": "The Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities. In addition to the reimbursement of the expenses specified in Section 4 hereof, the Agent will receive the following compensation for its services hereunder: (a) One percent (1.00%) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Subscription and Community Offering, excluding in each case shares purchased by (i) any employee benefit plan of the Company or the Bank established for the benefit of their respective directors, officers and employees, and (ii) any director, officer or employee of the Company or the Bank or members of their immediate families (which term shall mean parents, grandparents, spouse, siblings, children and grandchildren); and (b) With respect to any Securities sold by a National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\"NASD\") member firm (other than Sandler O'Neill) in the Syndicated Community Offering, (i) the compensation payable to Selected Dealers, (ii) any sponsoring dealer's fees; and (iii) a management fee to Sandler O'Neill of one percent (1.0 %) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering.",

                "explanation": "By moving the statement pertaining to sponsorship fees being provided only through unanimous voting of shareholders and board members, it obscures the original agreement and makes it difficult to locate, and thus enforce, the original agreement regarding sponsorship fees. Additionally, it may be contradictory to the original agreement for the agent to receive funds based on previous agreements.",

The Company, the MHCs and the Bank covenant with the Agent as follows: (a) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank will prepare and file such amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Holding Company Application, the MHC Application and the Proxy Statement as may hereafter be required by the Securities Act Regulations or the OTS Regulations or as may hereafter be requested by the Agent. Following completion of the Subscription and Community Offering, in the event of a Syndicated Community Offering, the Company, the MHCs and the Bank will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the results of the Subscription and Community Offering, any additional information with respect to the proposed plan of distribution and any revised pricing information or (ii) if no such post-effective amendment is required, will file with the Commission a prospectus or prospectus supplement containing information relating to the results of the Subscription and Community Offering and pricing information pursuant to Rule 424 of the Securities Act Regulations, in either case in a form acceptable to the Agent. The Company, the MHCs and the Bank will notify the Agent immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) of the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment of the Registration Statement, the filing of any supplement to the Prospectus and the filing of any amendment to the Plans, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the OTS or the Commission with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plans, (iii) of any request by the Commission or the OTS for any amendment to the Registration Statement or the Plans or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the OTS of any order suspending the Offerings or the use of the Prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, and (vi) of the receipt of any notice with respect to the suspension of any qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. The Company, the MHCs and the Bank will take all necessary action to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.",

                "explanation": "By removing the required filing of post-effective statements with the commission regarding results and pricing information after the Subscription and Community Offering, the filing requirements are lessened and it becomes much harder for investors to become informed. Additionally, the addition of finding new firms willing to work at lower costs introduces a lack of effort and contradictory statement to the original intent of finding qualified firms.",

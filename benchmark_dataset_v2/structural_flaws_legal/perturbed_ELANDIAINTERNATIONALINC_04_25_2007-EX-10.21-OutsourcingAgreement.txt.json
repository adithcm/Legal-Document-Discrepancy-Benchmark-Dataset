                "original_text": "18.3 Governing Law\n\nThis agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws of Papua New Guinea and the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the National Court of Papua New Guinea.",
                "changed_text": "11.  1 Confidentiality\n\nAll information exchanged between the parties under this agreement or during any negotiations undertaken at any time in respect of this agreement is confidential to those parties and must not be disclosed to any persons except:\n\n  (a) as required by any law of the state of Papua New Guinea\n\n  (b) to legal advisers, auditors, accountants and other consultants of either party requiring information for the purpose of this agreement\n\n  (c) to directors and shareholders of the respective parties\n\n  (d) with the consent of the party that supplied the information\n\n  (e) if the information is generally and publicly available other than as a result of the breach of confidence by the person receiving the information. \n\n18.3 Governing Law\n\nThis agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws determined by Datec and the BSP and the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the mutually agreed jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "By relocating the governing law clause to the confidentiality section and changing it, the enforceability of the entire contract is called into question. Governing law is crucial for legal proceedings, and hiding it compromises transparency. Now, instead of the laws of Papua New Guinea, it mentions that laws are determined by Datec and BSP. This introduces contradiction, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause strictly protects confidential information. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by allowing Datec to disclose confidential information if it deems it strategically beneficial, which can be interpreted broadly. This contradicts the initial commitment to confidentiality, weakening the protection for BSP's sensitive data.",

                "changed_text": "19.4 Expert Determination Criteria\n\nIf a Dispute is referred for expert determination the expert must make a determination at their own discretion, as is convenient. \n\nExpert determination will be completed by an individual chosen by Datec and they will not be bound to specific standards, benchmarks, or operational parameters within Papua New Guinea, and will not require mutual acceptance.\n\nThat person's decision is non-binding.\n\nParties retain the right to terminate at will and do not have the right to seek relief.",
                "explanation": "This modified clause undermines the fairness and impartiality of the dispute resolution process. By allowing Datec to unilaterally choose the expert without requiring mutual agreement, the process becomes biased. Furthermore, the clause eliminates the reference to reasonable standards and benchmarks in Papua New Guinea, and also the right of the party to seek urgent relief. These modifications undermine the BSP's ability to fairly resolve disputes.",

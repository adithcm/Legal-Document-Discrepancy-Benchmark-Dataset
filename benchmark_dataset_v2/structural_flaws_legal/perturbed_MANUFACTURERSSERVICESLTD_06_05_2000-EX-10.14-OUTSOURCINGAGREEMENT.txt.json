The Employees who accept employment offers from             MSL and who have begun their employment with MSL (\"Transferred             Employees\") will be employed by MSL in accordance with the terms set             forth below. IBM will terminate all Employees, listed in Attachment             2, at the Effective Date of this Agreement and IBM will be             responsible for any and all employment related liabilities up to the             Effective Date, including, but not limited to, vacation and sick             time, workers compensation claims, variable compensation, and             severance.\n\n      c)    MSL agrees that all Transferred Employees will be continuously             employed by MSL for at least [*] after the Effective Date, except as             otherwise provided herein, and will receive a total compensation             package as identified in Attachment 2: Employee list and Benefits             Information. Furthermore, with respect to the Transferred Employees,             MSL shall grant, to the extent granted by IBM, credit for service             with IBM prior to the Effective Date for purposes of participation             and eligibility to participate under MSL's employee benefit plans             and other policies and programs of MSL.\n\n      d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall operate in any way to limit or             prevent MSL from terminating any Transferred Employee at any time             for reasons of cause related to poor job performance or conditions             of employment.\n\n      e)    If MSL suffers a substantially adverse change in its business,             related to a reduction in IBM's Products requirements, including             reductions of Products requirements due to migration to a             competitive supplier, for the [*] from the Effective Date of this             Agreement, MSL may terminate such number of Transferred Employees             as it deems necessary. However, IBM shall only reimburse MSL for             termination benefits paid to such Transferred Employees, which are             substantially similar to IBM's then severance package, and             provided that all MSL subcontractors and other MSL non management             employees assigned to the US Work Center have been terminated             prior to or along with the termination of the Transferred             Employees.\n\n      f)    IBM agrees that, for a period of [*] years from the Effective Date             of this Agreement, it will not in any way solicit for employment             any Transferred Employees without the prior written consent of MSL;             provided, however, that the foregoing will not restrict or prevent             IBM from a) employing any such person who contacts IBM on his or her             own initiative without any solicitation or encouragement from IBM             or b) by using general employment advertising or communications or             independent search firms, hiring any person who responds thereto,             provided that IBM does not direct or encourage such independent             search firms to solicit such Transferred Employees.",

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by IBM             and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of IBM,             enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions.\n\n      c)    Noncontravention\n\n            Neither the execution and the delivery of this Agreement, nor the             consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do or will\n\n            i)    conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the                   certificate of incorporation or bylaws of IBM, or\n\n            ii)   result in or give rise to the imposition of any lien upon the                   assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List that would have a                   materially adverse effect on the assets listed therein, or\n\n            iii)  violate any constitution, statute, regulation, rule,                   injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling charge or other                   restriction of any Governmental Authority to which IBM is                   subject.\n\n            Except for the required filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, IBM             is not required by applicable law or other obligation to give any             notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any authorization,             consent, or approval of any Governmental Authority or other person             in order for the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated             by this Agreement.\n\nd)    Assets Used by IBM to Conduct Business\n\n      The assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1 and in Attachment 5:       Equipment and Program Loan List are the tangible assets used by IBM up       until the Effective Date for the operation of the business to be conducted       by MSL on and after the Effective Date and pursuant to Attachment 1:       Statement of Work.\n\ne)    Inventory\n\n      The assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset Listing, Part 2 and in Attachment       5: Equipment and Program Loan List are the tangible assets used by IBM up       until the Effective Date to build to the IBM specification and designs to       be used by MSL in fulfilling its obligations on and after the Effective       Date and pursuant to Attachment 1: Statement of Work.\n\nf)    Title to Assets\n\n      IBM has good and marketable title to all assets listed on Attachment 3:       Asset Listing, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances and MSL shall       acquire a bill of sale transferring good and marketable title to said\n\n      assets, free of liens and encumbrances.

If IBM is unable to clear all such materially adverse liens       or encumbrances within sixty (60) days after notice, IBM shall complete       reasonable actions necessary, to provide MSL with materially unencumbered       enjoyment of the assets.\n\ng)    Employees\n\n      To the best knowledge of the Charlotte Program Director of General       Hardware and Communications, Procurement, no employee or group of       employees has any plans to refuse to accept any offer of employment from       MSL made in compliance with this Agreement.",

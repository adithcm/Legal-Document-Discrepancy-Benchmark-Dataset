The Work Plan is more fully described in Exhibit A, which is hereby  incorporated by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further developed or modified (or the like) under the Work  Plan shall be referred to as \"Modified CB1\". Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and signed by both Cargill and Bioamber and  may be subject to incremental fees depending on resource requirements. This Development Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota,  United States of America, disregarding its conflicts of law rules.",

Governing law clauses are typically in a 'Miscellaneous' or 'General Provisions' section. This relocation reduces its enforceability, as the parties might overlook it.",

Accordingly, in addition to any other relief to which the Disclosing  Party may be entitled at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek a temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief from  any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party.",

Any public statements related to work performed under this Development Agreement, including public statements related to the  existence of this Development Agreement itself, will only be made after the prior written consent of both Parties concerning timing, content,  and audience. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Development Agreement, each Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of confidentiality  and use as provided in this Section may result in irreparable harm and damages to the Disclosing Party in an amount difficult to ascertain  and that cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award.

                "explanation": "Moving the injunctive relief clause from the 'Confidentiality' section to the 'Publicity' section is a structural flaw because injunctive relief is directly related to breaches of confidentiality, not publicity. By placing it in an irrelevant section, it reduces its enforceability and may cause confusion as to when injunctive relief can be sought.",

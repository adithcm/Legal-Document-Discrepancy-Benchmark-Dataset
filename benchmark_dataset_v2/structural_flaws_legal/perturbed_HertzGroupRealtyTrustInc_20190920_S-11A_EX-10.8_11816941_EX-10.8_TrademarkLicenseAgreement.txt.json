In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding.",

In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that the prevailing party *may*, at the discretion of the court, be entitled to recover from the other party upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be entitled to recover' to 'may, at the discretion of the court, be entitled to recover' weakens the enforceability of the attorney's fees clause. It introduces ambiguity and relies on judicial discretion, making it less certain that the prevailing party will recover their legal fees. This contradicts the original intent of a clear entitlement to attorney's fees, potentially deterring legal enforcement of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Adding \"However, Licensor will make reasonable efforts to ensure the Licensed Mark does not infringe on any existing intellectual property rights\" after disclaiming all warranties creates a contradiction. While the section aims to limit liability, this addition suggests a duty to avoid infringement, which undermines the explicit disclaimer of warranties, including non-infringement.

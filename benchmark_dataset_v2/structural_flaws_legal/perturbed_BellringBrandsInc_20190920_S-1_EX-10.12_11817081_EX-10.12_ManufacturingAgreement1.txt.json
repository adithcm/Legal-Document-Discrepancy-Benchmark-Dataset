                "original_text": "Venue for any litigation arising out of this Agreement shall be in any court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco, California. The Parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of that state for such purposes. All matters relating to this Agreement, the rights of the Parties hereunder and the construction of the terms hereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.",
                "changed_text": "Venue for any litigation arising out of this Agreement shall be at a location to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. The Parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of that location for such purposes. All matters relating to this Agreement, the rights of the Parties hereunder and the construction of the terms hereof shall be governed by the laws of a state to be mutually agreed upon, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies California law and jurisdiction. The modified clause replaces this with a provision for 'mutual agreement' on the venue and governing law, creating uncertainty and potentially undermining the enforceability of the contract by making the governing law ambiguous. Contractual clauses dictating location/governing law are key. ",

Commercial General Liability Insurance with a limit of $[***] each occurrence and $[***] in the aggregate, including Contractual, Completed-Operations and Product-Liability Coverage with a limit of $[***] for each occurrence, covering both bodily injury and property damage liability. ii. Umbrella/Excess Liability with a limit of $[***].",

                "explanation": "Changing the term introduces contradiction by replacing clear specifications for types and amounts of insurance coverage with vague language about amounts to be 'determined at a later date', creating uncertainty and rendering this section difficult to enforce. Specific insurance levels are important for manufacturers. ",

At Premier's option, Premier can direct Heritage to, and upon such direction Heritage shall, conduct such Recall Action (and Heritage shall ensure Jasper's cooperation). Premier shall determine, in its sole discretion, the manner, text and timing of any publicity to be given such matters upon prior consultation with Heritage. In the event a Recall Action is initiated or directed by Premier, Heritage agrees to fully cooperate and take all such steps as are reasonably requested to implement the Recall Action in a timely and complete manner. Any and all action to be taken in connection with a Recall Action shall be in accordance with FDA policies and other applicable laws and regulations. Heritage shall bear all costs, fees and out-of-pocket expenses associated with any Recall Action which results from (i) Heritage's or Jasper's negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) Heritage's or Jasper's failure to comply with Product Specifications or the Post Holdings Quality Expectations Manual set forth on Schedule A, (iii) any breach of this Agreement by Heritage or (iv) ingredients or packaging materials purchased by Heritage or Jasper. In all other cases, Premier shall bear all costs associated with any Recall Action.",

The cost of any recall action shall be subject to negotiations between the parties.",
                "explanation": "Changing the term introduces contradiction by weakening Premier's control over product recalls, a crucial safety measure. This change shifts responsibility for recall costs and decision making and creates the uncertainty of 'subject to negotiations between the parties', impacting clarity and enforceability of Premier's rights. Premier's recall responsibility is key. ",

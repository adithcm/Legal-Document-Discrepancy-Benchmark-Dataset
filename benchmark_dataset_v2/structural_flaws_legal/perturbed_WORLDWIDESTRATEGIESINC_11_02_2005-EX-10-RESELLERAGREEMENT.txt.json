                "explanation": "Moving the Limited Warranty clause, which normally appears under \"Terms and Conditions of Sale\", to a section titled \"Additional Matters\" significantly reduces its prominence and makes it less likely that a reseller or customer will be aware of its contents. Warranties are crucial in software and service agreements, and their placement in an unexpected location can be construed as an attempt to obscure them, hindering enforceability.",

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to a section about TouchStar's Duties makes it less visible and harder to find for parties seeking information on dispute resolution. By placing the arbitration requirement under Touchstar's duties, instead of dispute resolution sections, it's more ambiguous whether it's a mutual agreement or obligation on Touchstar's side. This affects the enforceability of the clause as it is not readily apparent or clearly positioned as a term applicable to both parties in case of disputes.",

Any controversy or claim between the Parties or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, other than any action taken to enforce the right to payment of Structured Payments, shall be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each of the Parties hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in New York, New York for purposes of all actions taken to enforce the right to payment of the Structured Payments.",

AT&T is not responsible for any travel, meal or other business related expense incurred by Vendor, whether or not incurred in its performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in addition to any such amounts that are included in the Structured Payments. Arbitration shall be the method of resolution in the event of a dispute, and no party shall have the right to seek litigation, but the method of resolution shall be determined by mutual agreement. ",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause has been moved to a section about Reimbursable Expenses, making it difficult to find. The modified arbitration clause introduces contradictionâ€”the first part states arbitration is the method of resolution in the event of a dispute, and no party shall have the right to seek litigation, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the dispute resolution method. This contradicts the original clause's strict arbitration requirement, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

Vendor and its employees, agents, and Subcontractors shall refer any questions from the media or third parties regarding the Work to AT&T and shall not discuss the Work with the media or third parties, without the prior written ATTIP Consent. For the purpose of clarity, any disclosure of the existence of this Agreement or the Work by Vendor as required by Law, including the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shall not be a violation of this section; provided that, prior to any such disclosure being made in the first instance, Vendor shall give AT&T a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (including any press release). To the extent that any disclosure required to be made by Vendor to the Securities and Exchange Commission has been previously reviewed by AT&T, then Vendor shall not be required to provide AT&T with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon prior to such disclosure being made thereafter so long as no substantive changes have been made thereto. A breach of this \"Publicity\" Section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.",

Moving them to the 'Publicity' section, which concerns media relations, obfuscates their importance and accessibility, making it less likely that Vendor personnel will be aware of or understand these protections.",

Original signatures transmitted and received via facsimile or other electronic transmission of a scanned document (e.g., pdf or similar format) are true and valid signatures for all purposes hereunder and shall bind the Parties to the same extent as that of original signatures. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original but all of which together shall constitute only one document.",
                "explanation": "The clause stating that transmitted signatures are true and valid signatures is moved to section 3.34, which concerns supplier citizenship, this obfuscates their legal importance. In addition, having this clause in this part might lead to confusion, thus, invalidating the legal signature.",

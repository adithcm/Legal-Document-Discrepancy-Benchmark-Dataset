                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance. However, the Licensee's efforts to cure such noncompliance shall not be subject to legal enforcement.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'However, the Licensee's efforts to cure such noncompliance shall not be subject to legal enforcement' after the original text introduces ambiguity. The Licensee is supposed to cure the noncompliance in a reasonable time frame; however, the second sentence added provides that if the licensee does not cure the noncompliance, there will be no legal enforcement.",

However, this compliance is subject to the Licensee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'However, this compliance is subject to the Licensee's discretion' directly contradicts the initial statement about complying with all applicable laws.

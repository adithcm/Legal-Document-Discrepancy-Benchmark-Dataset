The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",

The Licensee agrees that the business operated by it in connection with the Licensed Mark shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and requirements of any governmental body in the Territory or elsewhere as may be applicable to the operation, advertising, and promotion of the business and that it shall notify the Licensor of any action that must be taken by the Licensee to comply with such law, rules, regulations or requirements.",
                "explanation": "Moving the 'Compliance With Laws' clause to the 'Headings' section buries a crucial legal obligation within a section typically concerned with document formatting. This makes it less likely to be noticed and adhered to, reducing its enforceability. The heading section wouldn't typically be reviewed for operational obligations.",

                "explanation": "The disclaimer clause, which normally should be reviewed closely, is moved to the 'Counterparts' section, where parties generally look for practical information about the agreement's execution rather than significant disclaimers.

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Effect of Termination' clause to the 'Entire Agreement' section dilutes its importance. The Entire Agreement section is often considered boilerplate, and parties might not focus on the specific post-termination obligations outlined. This relocation makes the licensee's responsibilities after termination less prominent, potentially weakening enforcement. The licensee could claim unawareness of the detailed termination obligations.",

This Agreement supersedes and merges into it all prior agreements and understandings between the Investor, the Agent and the Lenders, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. No delay or failure by the Agent or the Lenders in the exercise of any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof and no single or partial exercise by the Agent or the Lenders of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise of any other right or remedy. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Investor and the Investor's successors, transferees and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, and its successors, transferees, and assigns. Any invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or application of this Agreement shall not affect other lawful provisions and applications hereof and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable.\n\n14. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Investor, the Agent and the Lenders have agreed that there are no intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and specifically, that the Borrowers and their respective affiliates, successors and assigns are not third party beneficiaries.\n\n15. GOVERNING LAW. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. However, the parties agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration in a location to be mutually agreed upon, and each party waives their right to trial by jury.\n\n16. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. AT THE OPTION OF THE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY FEDERAL COURT OR MINNESOTA STATE COURT SITTING IN HENNEPIN COUNTY OR\n\n5\n\nRAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA; AND THE INVESTOR, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH COURT AND WAIVE ANY ARGUMENT THAT VENUE IN SUCH FORUMS IS NOT CONVENIENT. In the event that the jurisdiction is challenged in court, then the decision to use the Minnesota courts would be at the discretion of the Agent.\n\n17. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. EACH OF THE INVESTOR, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, unless both parties consent to a jury trial.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law and dispute resolution clauses (consent to jurisdiction and waiver of jury trial) to a section concerning general provisions, and then modifying the governing law and venue to be more contradictory creates a legal contradiction. The governing law clause initially designates Minnesota law but adds an arbitration clause. This creates an internal conflict. The consent to jurisdiction clause is modified so that venue is at the discretion of the Agent if challenged, creating an imbalance of power.",

The Investor acknowledges and agrees that if a Maintenance Event of Default (as defined in Section 10 below) has occurred and is continuing hereunder, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, shall have the non-exclusive right to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobtain specific performance of the obligation of the Investor to make the Required Capital Contributions. If specific performance is not a remedy then available to the Agent and the Lenders for any reason, the Agent and the Lenders will suffer damages in an amount which, due to the special nature of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, will be impracticable or extremely difficult to ascertain. Determination of such damages would necessitate determinations of value which would be based upon speculative determination of the value of assets of the Borrowers and the capacity of assets of the Borrowers to pay the Obligations and other Indebtedness of the Borrowers. Such damages are uncertain and incapable of estimation as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain so to the date of the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder. The Investor, the Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the full amount of each Required Capital Contribution that has not been made by the Investor and (ii) the then-outstanding balance of the Obligations, represents a reasonable estimate of the damages which the Agent and the Lenders will sustain upon the occurrence of an Maintenance Event of Default hereunder, and (b) such lesser amount will be the full, agreed and liquidated damages resulting from the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder. The payment of such amount is intended to constitute liquidated damages to the Agent and the Lenders and shall not be deemed to constitute a forfeiture or penalty. Upon receipt by the Agent, such amount may, in the sole discretion of the Agent, be applied to the Obligations when and as due; provided, however, that such amount, if so applied, may not be reborrowed by any Borrower under the Financing Agreement.",

                "explanation": "I modified the Specific Performance and Liquidated Damages clause to introduce contradiction about how liquidated damages are calculated, and by changing that a reborrow under the financing agreement is allowed. Changing that the determination of damages shall not include opportunity cost of the missed contribution reduces the amount that the lender can recover from a default. The agreement also states the opposite that a reborrow is not allowed.",

Any party may give written notice to any other party of the existence of a Dispute (a \"Dispute Notice\").\n13.3.2 Negotiation. Within five (5) days after delivery of any Dispute Notice the parties involved in the Dispute shall meet at a mutually agreeable time and place and thereafter as often as they deem reasonably necessary to exchange relevant information and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the Dispute. If the Dispute has not been resolved within ten (10) days after the first meeting of the parties, or, if the party receiving the Dispute Notice will not meet within ten (10) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice, then either party may, by delivering notice to the other party, commence arbitration proceedings.\n13.3.3 General Dispute Resolution Provisions. (a) All deadlines specified in this Section 13.3 may be extended by mutual agreement. The procedures specified in this Section 13.3 are an essential provision of this Agreement and are legally binding on the parties.

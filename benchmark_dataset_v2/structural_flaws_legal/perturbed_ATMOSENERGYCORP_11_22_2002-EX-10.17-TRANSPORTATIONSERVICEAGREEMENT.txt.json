This Agreement and the rights and duties of                   Transporter and Shipper hereunder shall be governed by and                   interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of                   Arkansas, without recourse to the law governing conflict of                   laws.",

This Agreement and the rights and duties of                   Transporter and Shipper hereunder shall be governed by and                   interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of                   Delaware, without recourse to the law governing conflict of                   laws.",
                "explanation": "Changing the applicable law from Arkansas to Delaware introduces uncertainty, as the contract's enforceability depends on consistent and relevant state law. If the contract involves Arkansas-specific regulations, changing the state to Delaware creates a legal contradiction and impedes proper legal interpretation, making the contract difficult to enforce, due to relevant precedents being different.",

This Agreement constitutes the entire                   agreement between Transporter and Shipper concerning the                   subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings                   and written and oral agreements relative to said matter.",

This Agreement constitutes the entire                   agreement between Transporter and Shipper concerning the                   subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings                   and written and oral agreements relative to said matter. However, any verbal agreements made after the signing of this contract may or may not be subject to enforcement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that the written agreement supersedes all prior agreements. By adding 'However, any verbal agreements made after the signing of this contract may or may not be subject to enforcement,' introduces a contradiction. It creates ambiguity about the validity of verbal agreements, contradicting the 'entire agreement' clause and undermining the contract's enforceability.",

If the communication involves any type of litigation, then it will only be properly delivered if it is sent via telepathy. ",
                "explanation": "The first clause defines how proper communication can be completed. By adding 'If the communication involves any type of litigation, then it will only be properly delivered if it is sent via telepathy' creates ambiguity. It is impossible to send a formal legal notice via telepathy which will cause confusion and undermine the enforceability of the legal communication. Therefore, it creates a legal contradiction.",

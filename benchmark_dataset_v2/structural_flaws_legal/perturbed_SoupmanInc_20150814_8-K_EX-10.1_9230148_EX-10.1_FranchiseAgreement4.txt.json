                "changed_text": "As of the execution date of this agreement, the Franchisor represents that there are no pending administrative, criminal, or civil actions against the Franchisor alleging violations of franchise, antitrust, or securities laws. However, this representation is not a guarantee against future litigation.",
                "explanation": "This change dilutes the original disclosure. Originally it says neither the franchisor, its predecessor nor any person listed has an action pending against them. In the revised version, the disclosure is significantly weakened. Instead of a comprehensive statement about the absence of pending litigation, it becomes a limited representation valid only 'as of the execution date' and disclaims any guarantee against future litigation. This undermines the disclosure requirement to provide potential franchisees with a clear picture of the franchisor's litigation history and potential risks.",

                "changed_text": "The Franchisor warrants that to the best of its knowledge, no current officer or general partner has filed for bankruptcy in the last year.",
                "explanation": "The original section required disclosing bankruptcy history of the franchisor, its affiliates, predecessors, officers, or general partners within the last *ten* years. The altered text drastically reduces the scope, only addressing current officers and general partners within the last *one* year and qualifies it with 'to the best of its knowledge.' This makes it harder to hold the Franchisor accountable for undisclosed bankruptcy filings outside of that scope or that they claim to not know about.",

The full scope of the Litigation disclosure is detailed in a separate document, Exhibit A.",
                "explanation": "Instead of the original legal text, which lists examples of claims that would make a case legally relevant, the revised text limits the text to merely state there are some actions alleging 'comparable civil allegations'. The changed text says the full Litigation disclosure is 'detailed in a separate document, Exhibit A.' This is misleading because the Exhibit A document is not accessible, or cannot be found, by the other party. This violates law because it prevents the other party from being informed of the required litigation details.",

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each Party hereby agrees and consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, in any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such Action by the delivery of such process to such Party at the address and in the manner provided in Section 13.3 hereof. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                "explanation": "By changing 'hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives' to 'may waive' the enforceability of the jury trial waiver is reduced. The original text clearly and forcefully waives the right to a jury trial, whereas the changed text introduces ambiguity by suggesting the right to a jury trial can be waived, but does not mandate it.",

                "explanation": "By adding a cap of $1000 on losses, the indemnification clause is weakened and can be seen as contradictory. This limit can significantly reduce the actual protection offered to the indemnified parties.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'except for use cases that may compete with Arizona', the clause becomes contradictory. The clause initially states the license is 'perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free' implying unrestricted usage.

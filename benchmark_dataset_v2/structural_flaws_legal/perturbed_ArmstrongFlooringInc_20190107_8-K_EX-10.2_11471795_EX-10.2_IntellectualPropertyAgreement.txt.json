                "explanation": "By changing 'irrevocably and unconditionally waives' to 'agrees that any right such party may have...is subject to mutual consent,' the contract introduces a contradiction. Originally, the jury trial waiver was absolute; now, it requires mutual agreement. This undermines the enforceability of the waiver, creating ambiguity as to whether a jury trial is truly waived.",

                "explanation": "Introducing the clause 'unless otherwise determined by the court' after 'without the requirement of posting a bond or other security' injects uncertainty into the specific performance clause. It contradicts the original intent by allowing judicial discretion to require a bond, undermining the assurance of equitable relief. This could hinder timely and effective enforcement of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'but only if the Indemnifying party is given a right to cure said breach within 30 days' to clause (a), it diminishes the scope of the indemnification clause and its immediate impact. Similarly, the addition of 'provided however that this is applicable only if Indemnifying party is deemed a repeat offender' limits the liability of the Indemnifying party to the gross negligence clause. These conditions introduce a level of ambiguity and create an additional burden to prove that the Indemnifying party failed to cure or is a repeat offender, adding extra legal processes for the Indemnified Parties.",

                "explanation": "The original text provided a clear and structured dispute resolution process, emphasizing cooperation and a defined mediation procedure in London, in English. The new text introduces contradictions by changing core elements of the dispute resolution process:\n\n1.  Mediator Appointment: Originally appointed by written agreement or CEDR, now it's by 'mutual verbal agreement' (difficult to prove) or a 'coin flip' (not a professional method).\n2.  Mediation Location/Language: Changed from London/English to Paris/French, potentially creating logistical and linguistic barriers.\n3.  Confidentiality: Changed from private/without prejudice to public/with prejudice, discouraging open communication.\n4.  Mediation Timing: Reduced from 30 days to 1 day, making meaningful mediation nearly impossible.\n\nThe dispute resolution has been severely compromised, and the changes introduce ambiguities and impracticalities that weaken its enforceability.",

The modification introduces methods of notification that are impractical and lack verifiable proof of delivery, such as 'carrier pigeon' and 'smoke signal.' This undermines the reliability and verifiability of notice delivery, potentially leading to disputes over whether proper notice was given.

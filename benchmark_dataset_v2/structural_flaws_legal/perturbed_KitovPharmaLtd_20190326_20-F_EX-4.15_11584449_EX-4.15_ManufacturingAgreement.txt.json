            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Kitov warrants that it has established and maintains a compliance program and reasonable internal controls and procedures appropriate to ensure that Human Trafficking is not taking place in any part of its supply chain and in any part of its own business, including, inter alia, the following: a) Kitov and its Affiliates (and including any Distributors, agents, or other person associated with or acting on their behalf) do not employ any person younger than the applicable legal minimum age for working, and children and young people less than eighteen years of age are not employed in hazardous conditions. a) Kitov and its Affiliates (and including any Distributors, agents, or other person associated with or acting on their behalf) do not employ any person on an involuntary basis and do not use forced, prison, bonded, or indentured labor.",
                "changed_text": "Kitov warrants that it will consider establishing a compliance program and internal controls to possibly address Human Trafficking within its supply chain and business operations. This consideration may include: a) A flexible approach to the minimum working age, acknowledging local customs; it's in the discretion of Kitov. b) A cautious approach to avoid involuntary labor if reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty regarding Human Trafficking compliance is weakened by changing 'has established and maintains' to 'will consider establishing,' making compliance discretionary. The specific safeguards are replaced with more ambiguous and discretionary language that contradicts the purpose of ensuring compliance with anti-trafficking laws.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be interpreted under principles of general contract law, but for specific disputes, the Parties may mutually agree to apply the laws of any jurisdiction they deem appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Israeli law. The change allows for ad hoc selection of governing law, which contradicts the initial exclusivity clause. This undermines the predictability and enforceability of the contract by introducing legal uncertainty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Standard contract law principles requiring clarity and consistency in governing law clauses",

                "changed_text": "Payments can be made via mutually agreed upon methods, with the currency determined at the time of invoicing, and transfer costs allocated at the discretion of Dexcel.",
                "explanation": "Original payment terms are specific (bank transfer, USD, net 30 days). The modified clause introduces ambiguity regarding payment method, currency, and cost allocation, contradicting the initial fixed terms and creating potential disputes. This violates the principle of clear and definite contract terms.",

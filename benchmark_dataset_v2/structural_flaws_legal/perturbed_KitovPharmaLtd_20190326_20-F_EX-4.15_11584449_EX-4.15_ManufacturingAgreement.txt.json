                "original_text": "1.2 \"Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws\" shall mean the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the Bribery Act 2010 (2010 Chapter 23) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, any rules or regulations under such acts, and any other anti-corruption or anti-bribery statutes, laws or regulations applicable to a Party.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a condition that Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws are only applicable if both parties agree to enforce them. This directly contradicts the intent and mandatory nature of these laws, which are legally binding regardless of mutual agreement. This clause would likely be unenforceable and mislead a party into thinking they can circumvent these laws by withholding agreement.",

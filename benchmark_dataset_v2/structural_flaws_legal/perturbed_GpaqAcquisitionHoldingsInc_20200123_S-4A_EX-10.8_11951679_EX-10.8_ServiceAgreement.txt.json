This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, without reference to principles of conflicts of law. Any suit or action filed or otherwise commenced in connection with this Agreement must be filed and litigated in an appropriate court located in the City of Canton, Ohio (provided, however, that if the suit or action involves a claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, then such suit or action must be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of the State of Ohio in Akron, Ohio), or such other venue as deemed appropriate by the HOF Entities. In the event of a dispute between an HOF Entity and Constellation regarding their rights and duties hereunder, the non-prevailing Party in any ensuing litigation shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the prevailing Party (including costs of discovery and expert witness fees).",

For purposes of any dispute, each party agrees to cover their legal fees and expenses regardless of litigation outcomes.",
                "explanation": "This change adds contradictory terms for attorney's fees within the same paragraph. The first sentence states the non-prevailing party will pay, while the added one specifies that each party will cover costs irrespective of the results. This creates a contradiction and therefore an enforceability issue.",

Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between Constellation and HOFV dated as of April 28, 2018 (which shall survive in accordance with its terms), the Parties hereto agree to maintain in confidence the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except with respect to their owners, lenders and advisors, each of whom is to be made aware of and instructed to comply with this confidentiality provision) unless the proposed disclosure of specific terms or conditions hereof is authorized in advance by the other Party or is otherwise required by law. In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both.",

The HOF Entities can also approve any promotional materials and/or advertising signs, with the exception of products associated with gambling, alcohol, and tobacco.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts the approval for advertising signs. The initial phrase grants HOF Entities written approval to reject materials, however the second phrase limits this approval, except for products associated with gambling, alcohol, and tobacco. If the initial phrase stated that any sign that had to do with gambling, alcohol, and tobacco had to have initial approval, that would make sense. However, it says, with the exception of these products, HOF Entities can still approve of promotional materials, which is redundant. This makes it difficult to determine what the obligations of the parties are, due to the contradiction of terms.",

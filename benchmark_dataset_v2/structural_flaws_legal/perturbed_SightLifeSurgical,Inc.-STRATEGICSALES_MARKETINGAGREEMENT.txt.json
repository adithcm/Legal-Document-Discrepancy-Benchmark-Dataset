                "original_text": "Surgical hereby certifies that Surgical is not currently nor has been debarred by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pursuant to 21 USC ยง335a(a) or (b), or under any similar law or regulation by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency or any other national or regulatory authority or agency. If Surgical becomes aware that Surgical is or becomes the subject of any debarment or similar proceedings in any jurisdiction, then Surgical shall promptly notify Imprimis.",
                "changed_text": "Surgical hereby certifies that Surgical is not currently nor has been debarred by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but Surgical is not obligated to report if Surgical becomes aware that Surgical is or becomes the subject of any debarment or similar proceedings in any jurisdiction, unless it is mandatory for Surgical to do so.",
                "explanation": "The clause concerning debarment by the FDA is weakened by introducing an exception that Surgical is not obligated to report if they become debarred, unless forced to do so. This contradicts the original requirement for prompt notification, making it more difficult for Imprimis to be informed of Surgical's debarment status, and therefore puts Imprimis in a difficult situation where it can violate laws, rules and regulations. Debarment status is critical information as it impacts Surgical's ability to legally perform the Services, impacting compliance with laws and regulations.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding the choice of law rules, but the parties agree that jurisdiction and venue for dispute resolution may be determined at the sole discretion of Surgical.",
                "explanation": "The clause requires disputes to be resolved in California state and federal courts, it is weakened by granting Surgical sole discretion over determining jurisdiction and venue. This contradicts the original agreement and introduces ambiguity, making enforcement unpredictable and potentially costly for Imprimis.",

                "explanation": "The clause requires the Sales Team to be knowledgeable in applicable laws. The altered text adds a proviso that a lack of knowledge does not constitute a breach. This contradiction undermines the requirement for legal compliance by effectively excusing non-compliance, making it difficult for Imprimis to enforce the standard of care and potentially leading to regulatory violations.",

In addition, if the Servicer Termination Event was as a result of the failure of the Marketing Agent to satisfy its obligation to make, or to cause the related Originators to make, required Upgrade Payments pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)(y), then Cellco shall also send a notice to (i) all Obligors who have a continuing right to an upgrade, indicating that Cellco has recently failed to make the necessary prepayments with respect to one or more of its customers in connection with an Upgrade Offer, and that if any Obligor chooses to upgrade and Cellco fails to make the related Upgrade Payment with respect to them, such Obligor will still be required to make payments on his or her original device payment plan agreement, but that such Obligor will have a corresponding recoupment right against his or her new device payment plan agreement with Verizon Wireless, and (ii) all Obligors who had initiated upgrades under an Upgrade Offer, indicating that Cellco had failed to make the relevant Upgrade Payment, and stating that such Obligors will continue to have an obligation to make payments on their original device payment plan agreements, but will have a corresponding right of recoupment against their new device payment plan agreements with Verizon Wireless.

If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules. This Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law doctrine. The Parties agree that the venue for the resolution of all disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein will be the County of Pinellas, State of Florida.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandated arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. The modified clause changes the dispute resolution method to be determined by mutual agreement, thereby removing the mandatory arbitration. Also, the original venue of the resolution was the County of Pinellas, State of Florida, but this has been modified to anywhere both parties agree to, making the clause difficult to enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Florida law favors arbitration but requires clear and unambiguous language for an arbitration agreement to be enforceable. Removing the mandatory arbitration and changing the venue could be challenged.",

As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest.",

The modified clause reverses the original arrangement, stating the Consultant will not be responsible for all tax returns and payments and the company will not be filing Form 1099-MISC, which are legal contradictions.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS regulations require companies to report payments to independent contractors via Form 1099-MISC. The Consultant has a responsibility to pay taxes under state and federal law, and indemnifying the company goes against this. ",

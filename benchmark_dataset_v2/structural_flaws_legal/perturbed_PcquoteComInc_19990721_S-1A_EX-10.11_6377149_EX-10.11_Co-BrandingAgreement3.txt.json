                "changed_text": "WHEREAS, PCQ and ABW have executed that certain Co-Branding Agreement dated October 11, 1996, as amended on December 10, 1996 (as so amended, the \"Agreement\");\nWHEREAS, both parties agree to resolve any dispute under conditions where each party is responsible for its legal fees. This clause is non-binding and is subject to future negotation.",
                "explanation": "Moving a clause related to dispute resolution and legal fees to the 'WHEREAS' section creates a contradiction. The 'WHEREAS' section is typically introductory and non-binding. Placing a statement about legal fees there makes it ambiguous whether it's an enforceable term, especially since it is indicated as non-binding and open for future negotiation.",

                "explanation": "Adding a clause about trademarks and logos each part will come to a mutual, non-binding resolution creates a conflict with the first statement that states one amendment will have governance over all conflicts.",

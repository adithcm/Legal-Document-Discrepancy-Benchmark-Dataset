The Licensee shall not disclose, publish, or disseminate the Confidential Information to anyone other than the Licensee's employees with a need to know and who have agreed in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Section, or as may be required by legal process. The Licensee agrees to use the same degree of care with respect to the Confidential Information that it takes to hold in confidence its own most valuable proprietary information, but not less than reasonable care, to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of the Confidential Information. The Licensee agrees to accept and use the Confidential Information only for the purpose of carrying out its authorized activities under this Agreement. In the event the Licensee is required to disclose the Confidential Information by an order of a court or governmental agency, then the Licensee shall first give written notice to Licensor to allow Licensor to make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order or other confidential treatment for the Confidential Information.

During the Term of this Agreement and during the three year period after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Licensee will not solicit any person employed by Licensor and/or its Affiliates to leave his or her employment with Licensor. For purpose of this Article the term \"Solicit\" means any affirmative recruitment specifically aimed at one or more individuals identified by name, title or affiliation, but shall not mean generally advertising job openings or any activities that constitute follow-up to individuals who respond to job opening advertisements or who voluntarily initiate employment inquiries.

                "explanation": "The removal of 'applicable law' clause and replacing it with warrants introduces a contradiction. The original clause ensures compliance with both PC Financial's privacy policy and applicable laws. The modified version only focuses on the privacy policy which can cause a legal contradiction.",

In the event of any dispute with respect to the construction, execution and performance of the provisions of this Agreement, such dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and rules made thereunder in force as on that date.

The arbitration shall be carried out in English language.",
                "explanation": "The restructuring of the sentence introduces contradiction—the first part states courts of New Delhi have exclusive jurisdiction, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the arbitration resolution.

ARBITRATION.\n\nExcept as provided in Section 8 herein, in the event of any dispute or\ncontroversy between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to\nthis Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereunder, such dispute\nor controversy shall be submitted to arbitration under the Commercial\nRules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association sited in\nWashington State, USA for decision in any such matter in accordance with\nthe then applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association or any\nsuccessor organization. The determination of the arbitrators shall not\nbe subject to judicial review, provided however, that any award or\ndetermination rendered by the arbitrators may be enforced any court of\njurisdiction.",

SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS\n\nExcept as provided in Section 8 herein, in the event of any dispute or\ncontroversy between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to\nthis Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereunder, such dispute\nor controversy shall be submitted to arbitration under the Commercial\nRules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association sited in\nWashington State, USA for decision in any such matter in accordance with\nthe then applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association or any\nsuccessor organization.

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Successors and Assigns' section makes it less visible and harder to find, decreasing its enforceability. Arbitration clauses are typically expected in a section specifically addressing dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "Moving the disclaimer of warranty into the non-disclosure section buries it within unrelated content. This makes it harder for the customer to readily identify and understand the limitations on XIMAGE's warranties, weakening its enforceability. Warranty disclaimers are expected to be clearly presented, not hidden within unrelated clauses.",

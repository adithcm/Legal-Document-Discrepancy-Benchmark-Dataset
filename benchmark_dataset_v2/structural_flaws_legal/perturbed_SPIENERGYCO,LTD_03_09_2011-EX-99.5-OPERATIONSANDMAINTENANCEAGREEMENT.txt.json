                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS CONTRACT.",
                "changed_text": "EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS CONTRACT. The parties agree, however, that if both parties mutually agree in writing, they can revert to trial by jury.",
                "explanation": "The original text had a clear and concise waiver of jury trial rights. Adding the second sentence introduces a conditional element, suggesting that the jury trial waiver can be overturned by mutual agreement. This undermines the enforceability of the initial waiver by creating an exception that could be exploited in litigation. This contradicts standard contract law where waivers need to be knowingly and voluntarily made, and not subject to later alteration without clear consideration.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces an exception to the explicit policy forbidding alcohol, creating a potential contradiction and ambiguity in the rules. This reduces the clarity of the original clause. It opens the door for interpretation issues and potential liability concerns, especially if someone is injured during an event with alcohol use.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates workplace safety regulations depending on the jurisdiction if alcohol consumption leads to unsafe conditions.",

The service provider reserves the right to delay reporting if they are undergoing internal reviews.",
                "explanation": "The addition of the second sentence introduces an ambiguity by providing the service provider a loophole to postpone producing the reports and other information relating to the SEF maintenance. The phrase 'reserves the right to delay reporting if they are undergoing internal reviews' is subjective and could be used to reduce the service provider's accountability when delivering the reports and other information.",

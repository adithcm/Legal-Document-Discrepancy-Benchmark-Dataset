                "original_text": "11.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict or choice of law principles. The Parties hereto agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action under this Agreement shall be the state and federal courts sitting in California, and each of the Parties hereby agrees and submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such purpose.",
                "changed_text": "5.3 Feedback. With regard to any recommendations, ideas, contributions, corrections. enhancements, improvements, or the like relating to the Services that are created or originated by Licensee (\"Feedback\"), Licensee shall, prior to disclosure of such Feedback to VOTOCAST, provide written notice to VOTOCAST if Licensee considers the Feedback to be proprietary to Licensee. The Parties will then exercise commercially reasonable efforts to reach an agreement regarding ownership and use of the Feedback prior to disclosure by Licensee. Any Feedback submitted to VOTOCAST without Licensee providing such written notice, shall be deemed the sole property of VOTOCAST and the same, together with all copyrights, trade secrets, patent rights, and other intellectual property thereto shall be and hereby are assigned to VOTOCAST.\n\n11.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect to conflict or choice of law principles. The Parties hereto agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action under this Agreement shall be the state and federal courts sitting in Clark County, Nevada, and each of the Parties hereby agrees and submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such purpose.",
                "explanation": "The clause specifying California law is moved to an unrelated section about feedback, then the original section changes California to Nevada. This creates a jurisdictional issue. The original section would lead one to believe that Nevada is the jurisdiction, while the new location of the original clause would have it connected to \"Feedback\". It would be unclear which jurisdiction has governing control over the contract.",

Any payments made later than the due date will accrue interest from the date due until the date paid at the rate of one percent (I%) per month on the amount due, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within sixty (60) days after the applicable due date, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST. Any such suspension does not relieve Licensee from paying fees past due plus interest and in the event of collection enforcement, Licensee shall be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, but not limited to, legal costs, attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 Acceptance Testing. Prior to the payment of the License and Hosting Fees defined in Exhibit A, Licensee shall have the right to conduct acceptance testing (\"Acceptance Testing\") to verify that the Services satisfy the acceptance criteria set forth in Exhibit B (\"Acceptance Criteria\"). Acceptance Testing shall commence within five (5) business days from the date on which VOTOCAST notifies Licensee, in writing by U.S. mail or electronic mail that all implementation work has been completed and is ready for Acceptance Testing by Licensee. In the event that the Services do not conform to the Acceptance Criteria, Licensee shall give VOTOCAST written notice thereof. VOTOCAST shall make commercially reasonable efforts to correct any deficiencies that prevent the Services from conforming to the Acceptance Criteria. When the Services have successfully conformed to or satisfied the Acceptance Criteria, Licensee shall give VOTOCAST written notice by U.S. mail or electronic mail of acceptance (\"Acceptance\"). Acceptance by Licensee shall be automatically deemed to have occurred: (a) fifteen (15) business days after Licensee's receipt, if Licensee does not communicate to VOTOCAST any defects in the Services, or (b) if Licensee uses the Services in the normal and usual operation of Licensee's business prior to written Acceptance. Licensee shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if, in its sole discretion, the Services have not conformed to the Acceptance Criteria within thirty (30) days from the date of Acceptance Testing; provided however, VOTOCAST shall continue to be entitled to receive, and Licensee shall be obligated to pay to VOTOCAST, any and all amounts owing for Implementation Fees up to the date of termination.\n\n4.2 Payment. All fees are due and payable within ninety (90) days of the applicable VOTOCAST invoice. Any payments made later than the due date will accrue interest from the date due until the date paid at the rate of one percent (I%) per annum on the amount due, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is greater. In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within thirty (30) days after the applicable due date, shall not be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will not be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST. Any such suspension does relieve Licensee from paying fees past due plus interest and in the event of collection enforcement, Licensee shall not be liable for any costs associated with such collection, including, but not limited to, legal costs, attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees.",
                "explanation": "The original payment clause is altered by changing 30 days to 90 days, changing monthly interest to annual interest, changing a 60-day failure to pay to a non-breach, and then removing the clause that assigns collection enforcement fees to the licensee. These contradictions would make it unclear what financial obligations the licensee holds. The modified clause would create confusion and ambiguity, undermining the enforceability of the payment terms.",

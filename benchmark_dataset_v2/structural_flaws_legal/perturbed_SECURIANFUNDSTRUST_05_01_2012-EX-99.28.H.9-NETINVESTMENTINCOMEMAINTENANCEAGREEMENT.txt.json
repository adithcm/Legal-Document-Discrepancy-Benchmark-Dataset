The Investment Adviser shall have the option to potentially recover some amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense\nWaiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income may exceed zero. In any event, however, the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, will constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day if the Investment Adviser somehow exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day is not then necessarily due and payable. If, and to the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would not cause the Fund's Net Investment Income to fall below zero, such payment will not be deferred until such date on which the",
                "explanation": "The original 'Right of Recovery' clause clearly outlines the Investment Adviser's ability to recover waived expenses. The modification introduces ambiguity by using words like 'potentially,' 'may,' 'somehow,' and 'not necessarily,' undermining the clarity and enforceability of the right to recovery. The clause also now appears under the Miscellaneous section, further obscuring its importance.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, U.S.A. without regard to conflict of law principles.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, U.S.A. without regard to conflict of law principles. Any action of any kind by either party arising out of this Agreement must be commenced within five (5) years from the date the right, claim, demand, or cause of action shall first arise.",
                "explanation": "The clause dictating the statute of limitations for claims arising from the agreement has been moved into the governing law section, which makes it harder to locate and could be misinterpreted as part of the choice of law provision rather than a distinct limitation on legal claims. This obscures the timeframe within which legal action can be taken.",
                "contradicted_law": "Statute of limitations laws are specific to the causes of action and vary by jurisdiction. The Connecticut law must be followed by all parties.",

Any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent will be permissible with an appeal to the board of directors which is subject to client approval.",
                "explanation": "The sentence was changed to introduce a contradiction. The first sentence states that no assignment will occur without written consent and the following sentence states that there is a path to allow an appeal to the board of directors that is also subject to client approval. Both cannot happen at the same time.",

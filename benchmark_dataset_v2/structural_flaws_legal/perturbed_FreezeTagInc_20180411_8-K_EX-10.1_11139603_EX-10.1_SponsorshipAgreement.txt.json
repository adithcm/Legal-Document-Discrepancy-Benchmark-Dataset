                "original_text": "11. Indemnification: Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, subcontractors and agents, from any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred on account of the their respective negligent acts or omissions, and those of their directors, employees, agents, contractors and sub- contractors, in connection with this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "18. Non-Assignment: This Agreement shall be between the Parties only, and does not grant rights to any other party. This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any amendment of this Agreement must be in writing signed by authorized representatives of each of the Parties. 11. Indemnification: Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, subcontractors and agents, from any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred on account of the their respective negligent acts or omissions, and those of their directors, employees, agents, contractors and sub- contractors, in connection with this Agreement. However, this clause does not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, in which case standard legal principles will apply.",
                "explanation": "Moved the indemnification clause to the non-assignment section, making it less visible. Modified the clause to include an exception for gross negligence or willful misconduct, which is a standard exception that may or may not be implied by law depending on the jurisdiction. The added text introduces potential ambiguity regarding the scope of indemnification and may contradict common law, hindering its enforceability. The additional condition creates a contradiction; it initially offers broad indemnification then limits it.",

Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company shall obtain and maintain at its expense, Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with a Best's rating of A+. The insurance shall be in an amount of: $2,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate with a $2,000,000 aggregate for products and completed operations. The Association must be a named additional insured, and shall be provided at least 30 days' notice for cancellation of policy and 10 days' notice for non-payment of premium. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory.",

However, Company may only assign its responsibilities under this Agreement with Association's prior written approval as provided in Section 18. 13. Insurance: During the term of this Agreement, and before any sponsorship or promotional activities are conducted under this Agreement, Company should endeavor to obtain Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage. The type and amount of insurance, and whether the Association is an additional insured, will be subject to further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "Moved the insurance clause to the successors and assigns section. Changed shall to should and added 'subject to further negotiation'. This introduces ambiguity and makes the insurance requirement less enforceable because it's not a firm obligation, which makes the term difficult to enforce.",

Scope: The Association agrees to identify and acknowledge Company as a supporter of the organization and the diabetes cause, as permitted in connection with qualified sponsorship payments and royalties under Section 513(i) and Section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations thereunder (\"Code\").

Company agrees to inform its business partners about Association's tax-exempt status. Company agrees to provide its services, as defined in Attachment A, in accordance with all applicable laws and in accordance with standards of decorum and taste so as not to adversely reflect upon the Association or its mission. 26.

                "explanation": "Moved the notice clause to the scope section, and removed specific delivery methods (fax, email, certified mail) and contact persons, introducing ambiguity. Changed the condition to be 'when convenient to the notifying party'. This makes formal notice difficult to prove, as there's no specific method or required contact person, and the phrase 'when convenient to the notifying party' creates uncertainty, undermining the enforceability of other contract clauses that rely on proper notice.",

                "explanation": "By moving the enforcement of licensed IP clause to the section about information exchange, this weakens the intended purpose of the right to enforce licensed IP.

                "explanation": "Relocating the specific reference to Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the explicit definition of intellectual property within that context to a definition for Registrable IP creates ambiguity. This makes it difficult for a non-legal expert to understand if the U.S. Bankruptcy code applies to the agreement.

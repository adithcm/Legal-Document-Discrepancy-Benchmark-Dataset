                "original_text": "This Agreement and performance under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Pennsylvania between Pennsylvania residents, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties expressly waive any right to a jury trial regarding disputes related to this Agreement. Unless otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation, any legal or other action related to this Agreement must be commenced no later than two years from the date on which the cause of action arose.",

                "explanation": "The choice of law clause now specifies Massachusetts law, potentially conflicting with the original intent to apply Pennsylvania law. Additionally, reducing the statute of limitations from two years to one could be detrimental, as it mandates that parties must file a lawsuit within a shorter period to pursue a claim.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the warranty clause to remove 'generally-accepted' from industry standards and reducing the reporting timeframe from 90 to 30 days limits the scope of VNE's liability and puts constraints on Converge's ability to claim for breach of warranty, making it difficult to enforce.",

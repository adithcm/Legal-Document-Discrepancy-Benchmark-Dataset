                "original_text": "          &sbsp; 10.6 Choice of Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation of Action. This Agreement and performance under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Pennsylvania between Pennsylvania residents, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties expressly waive any right to a jury trial regarding disputes related to this Agreement. Unless otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation, any legal or other action related to this Agreement must be commenced no later than two years from the date on which the cause of action arose.",
                "changed_text": "     5.3 Arbitration. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location of the arbitration shall be mutually agreed upon by both parties. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. The cost of arbitration shall be divided equally between the parties.\n\n          &sbsp; 10.6 Choice of Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation of Action. This Agreement and performance under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "The change involved moving the arbitration clause from a general section on legal matters to the warranty section, where it is less likely to be noticed. Additionally, the choice of law is changed to Delaware which may or may not be relevant to either party. Choice of Delaware law can be relevant because many companies are incorporated in Delaware.",

During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Converge and Vert each agree not to directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or cause others to solicit or encourage any employees or individual independent contractors of the other party to terminate their employment or independent contracting relationship with the other party and become an employee or independent contractor of the soliciting party or its Affiliate. This provision does not prohibit a party's responding to unsolicited employment inquiries and/or any indirect solicitations and other employment activities (e.g., job postings, advertising of positions) that are not specifically targeted at any particular individual.",
                "changed_text": "4.8 Non-Solicitation. During the initial 30 days of the Term of this Agreement, Converge and Vert each agree not to directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or cause others to solicit or encourage any employees or individual independent contractors of the other party to terminate their employment or independent contracting relationship with the other party and become an employee or independent contractor of the soliciting party or its Affiliate.

                "explanation": "The change involves relocating the non-solicitation clause from a dedicated 'Non-Solicitation' section to under Fees and Payments. Additionally, the time limitation is changed to 30 days, which introduces a contradiction. By limiting the term to only 30 days, it undermines the original intention of preventing employee poaching throughout the entire duration of the agreement and one year after.",

                "explanation": "Change involves altering the definition of 'Confidential Information' to include only written material and changing \"any and all\" to \"only printed and marked\". Introducing this change could severely limit what is protected as confidential under the agreement. It can create an ambiguity as oral or non-marked information will not be regarded as such, undermining the original comprehensive intent of protecting sensitive information.",

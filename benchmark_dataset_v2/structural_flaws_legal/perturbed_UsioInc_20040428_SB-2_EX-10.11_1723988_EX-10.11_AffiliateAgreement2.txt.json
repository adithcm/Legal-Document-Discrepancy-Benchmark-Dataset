                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that disputes will be resolved through arbitration in specific locations (McLean, Virginia or San Antonio, Texas), following the American Arbitration Association rules. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating that arbitration will occur at a mutually agreed-upon location and that the choice of arbitration rules depends on mutual agreement. This contradicts the original clause's mandatory arbitration in a specific location and under the AAA rules, potentially leading to disputes over the location and rules of arbitration. This is a legal contradiction as it introduces uncertainty and allows for deviation from a previously strict requirement.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that upon termination (except for specific defaults), Network 1 *shall* continue to pay the Affiliate's Fee under certain conditions. Changing 'shall' to 'may' introduces a significant legal contradiction. 'Shall' creates an obligation for Network 1 to pay, while 'may' grants them the discretion to choose whether or not to pay. This contradiction undermines the enforceability of the compensation terms and could be interpreted as a loophole allowing Network 1 to avoid payment obligations despite the Affiliate fulfilling the required conditions. This change shifts the responsibility and obligation from a definitive action to something that is at their discretion to do.",

                "explanation": "The original clause 4.01 iv gives explicit permission for affiliate to contact any organization that the Affiliate deems necessary to implement its ISO program. By adding the phrase 'except for direct sponsored ISO/MSP's of Network 1/Member Bank, or any merchants currently processing with Network 1 or Member Bank.' the clauses becomes legally contradictory. The clause initially grants permission to contract any organization deemed necessary for ISO program implementation, but it then restricts this permission by barring contact to specific members or entities. If the affiliate deems a direct sponsored ISO/MSP or any merchant currently processing with Network 1 or Member Bank necessary to implement it's ISO program it creates conflict because the clause prohibits them from doing so. This contradiction makes enforceability vague.",

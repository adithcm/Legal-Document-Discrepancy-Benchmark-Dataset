Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that no policyholder of the Company may take any action authorized under this paragraph 8 unless and until (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 8, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and, provided, further, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 8 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to, and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 8).",

                "explanation": "Adding the clause 'but this recourse is not applicable if the policyholder has previously engaged in conduct detrimental to the Company, as determined solely by AIG' introduces ambiguity and potential unenforceability. It gives AIG unilateral power to deny policyholder recourse based on a subjective determination, contradicting the initial grant of rights and hindering the enforceability of policyholder rights.",

                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from New York to Texas but adding an exception for AIG's internal governance under Delaware law creates ambiguity and potential conflict. This could lead to confusion about which state's laws apply in different disputes and could potentially weaken the contract's enforceability as policyholder rights are concerned.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction. While it initially compels the Company to comply with AIG policies, it then provides a vague exception: the Company is not required to comply if those policies would cause its Total Adjusted Capital to fall below a certain level. This contradiction creates a loophole that AIG can use to make its capital contribution discretionary.",

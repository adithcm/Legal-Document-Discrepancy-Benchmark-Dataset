                "explanation": "By changing \"all applicable laws\" to \"some laws\", the contract introduces ambiguity and contradiction. It is unclear which laws the distributor must comply with, weakening the enforceability of the clause related to legal compliance.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on the specific laws not complied with due to the ambiguity. Generally violates principles of contract law requiring clarity and certainty.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by first stating that the jurisdiction will be in Stamford, Connecticut but then allowing for another jurisdiction if there is a mutual agreement. The original text clearly defines jurisdiction to be Connecticut but the alteration makes that a conditional statement that is not readily enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The added statement at the beginning \"This Agreement is assignable by either party without consent,\" is in contradiction with the original text. The original text states assignment is only possible with written consent but the change allows the agreement to be assigned by either party regardless of consent. This would cause disputes over which section is upheld.",

However, in the event of a dispute, resolution will be determined by mutual agreement between the parties, irrespective of the Distribution Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding dispute resolution. The first part states the Distribution Agreement's dispute resolution applies, while the second allows for mutual agreement, nullifying the original agreement's terms and potentially violating requirements for clear dispute resolution processes.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and consistency in dispute resolution clauses; potential violation of jurisdiction-specific rules regarding mandatory arbitration if the original agreement specified it.",

Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.",

Initially, the purchase orders are non-changeable and non-cancellable except under specific time constraints, but after the change they can be cancelled or modified anytime for a fee.

Xplore holds sole discretion to accept product returns regardless of the agreement.",

The initial statement clearly defines the terms for product return and stock rotation based on the Distribution Agreement and purchase value.

                "explanation": "This adds a conflicting statement regarding the governing law. The agreement initially states that PRC law governs the entire agreement. Adding a clause specifying Delaware law for intellectual property creates ambiguity and a legal contradiction, making it unclear which jurisdiction's laws apply to specific aspects of the agreement and potentially undermining its enforceability in either jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The initial clause explicitly states that modifications must be in writing and signed by all parties. Adding 'However, amendments can be made via email confirmation' directly contradicts this. Email confirmation does not meet the standard of 'in writing signed by the parties,' creating a contradiction in the modification process and leading to unenforceability and a contradiction.",

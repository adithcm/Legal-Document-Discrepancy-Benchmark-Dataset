                "changed_text": "THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, unless mutually agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly waives the right to a jury trial. The modification introduces an exception ('unless mutually agreed upon'), creating a contradiction. The 'irrevocable' nature of the waiver is undermined by the conditional exception, making the enforceability of the jury trial waiver uncertain. Contract is under New York law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states the contract is governed by New York law. Adding 'except where federal law may apply' introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction. While federal law may preempt state law in certain areas, this clause does not specify which federal laws take precedence, creating uncertainty and potential for disputes over which jurisdiction's laws apply. Contract is under New York law.",

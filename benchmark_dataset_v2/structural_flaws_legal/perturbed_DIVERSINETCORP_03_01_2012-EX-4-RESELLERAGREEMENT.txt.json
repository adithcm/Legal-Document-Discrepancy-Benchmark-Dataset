Any litigation\nor other dispute resolution between the Parties relating to this Agreement or its construction shall take place in the courts of Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada. The Parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the provincial and federal courts therein. The Parties agree that the\nUnited Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. No action against Diversinet\nregardless of form, including negligence, arising out of any claimed breach of this Agreement or transactions under this Agreement may be\nbrought by Reseller more than two years after the cause of action has accrued.",
                "changed_text": "1. Customer Orders\n(a) Customer Agreements. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Reseller's Customers will acquire the Products and related services under\ncontract with Reseller, that Diversinet shall not have any contractual interest in Reseller's Customer relationships. Prior to Reseller\ncommitting to provide any Products to a Customer, Reseller shall cause Customer to enter into purchase agreement(s) with Reseller with\nrespect to each of the Products purchased by Customer (each, a \"Customer Agreement\"). Reseller agrees that it shall include terms and\nconditions in its Customer Agreements that are sufficient to protect Diversinet's interests as reflected in this Agreement, including, but not\nlimited to, those terms set out in Schedule 4 hereto. Such Customer Agreements shall be subject to Diversinet's approval, which approval\nshall not be unreasonably withheld. Reseller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Customers abide by the terms of the\napplicable Customer Agreement(s). Furthermore, Reseller shall enforce its Customer Agreements against Customer when requested to do so\nby Diversinet. For greater clarity, Diversinet expects that the Reseller will include all of the points covered in Section 4 in its end user\nagreement. When the Reseller receives a customer order they will fax both the end user agreement and the details of the order to Diversinet\nand if the end user agreement contains all of the points outlined in Section 4 then Diversinet will approve the order and ship the required\nproducts to the Reseller.\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any litigation\nor other dispute resolution between the Parties relating to this Agreement or its construction shall take place in the courts of Toronto, Ontario,\nCanada.

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Choice of Forum' clause to the 'Customer Orders' section is misleading because it buries the governing law and jurisdiction within a section that seems to relate to how customer orders are processed, not where legal disputes are to be resolved. This displacement makes it less likely that the reseller will be aware of the forum selection clause during a dispute.",

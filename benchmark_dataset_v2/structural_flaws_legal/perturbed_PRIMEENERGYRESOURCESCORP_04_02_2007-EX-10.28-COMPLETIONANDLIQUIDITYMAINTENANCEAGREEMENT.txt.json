This required liquidity\"  win reduce dollar-for-dollar with any additional shareholder advance s and increase dollar-for-dollar to a maximum of $21,000,000 with any  repayment of shareholder advances. To the extent that shareholder repayment has occurred, Prime agrees to fund additional shareholder loans  equal to the amount repayed by the shareholder, as needed to ensure Project Clomp let ion",
                "changed_text": "Prime will, during the term of the Credit Agreement, maintain liquidity consisting of unused revolver availability\" under the Credit Agreement dated  December!, 2002, as amended, with Prime et aland Guaranty, and/or unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $25,000,000.

To the extent that shareholder repayment has occurred, Prime agrees to fund additional shareholder loans  equal to the amount repayed by the shareholder, as needed to ensure Project Clomp let ion",
                "explanation": "By adding 'may be adjusted at the discretion of Prime based on market conditions, but not below $10,000,000,' the obligation to maintain $25,000,000 is undermined. This creates a legal contradiction because it suggests a fluctuating liquidity requirement when the original text implies a fixed minimum, potentially affecting Guaranty's security.",

                "explanation": "The added clause introduces a contradictory element. While the original states Texas law governs and litigation occurs in Harris County, the revision suggests mediation elsewhere and gives Guaranty the discretion to choose the governing law. This contradicts the initial agreement on jurisdiction and governing law, creating uncertainty and potentially weakening enforcement.",

Offshore is executing this Agreement to acknowledge that a breach of this Agreement would result in an Event ofDefault under the Credit Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By inserting 'material breach' and stating its definition will be subject to negotiation, the agreement's enforceability is weakened. The original text implied any breach triggers a default event, but this change introduces ambiguity and requires interpretation. This undermines the clarity of the default clause.",

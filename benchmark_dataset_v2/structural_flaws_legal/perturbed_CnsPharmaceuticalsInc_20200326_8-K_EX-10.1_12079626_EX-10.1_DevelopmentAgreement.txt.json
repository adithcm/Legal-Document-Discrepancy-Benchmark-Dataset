                "explanation": "Adding the clause 'Notwithstanding the above, WPD's compliance with the FCPA is subject to WPD's reasonable interpretation of said act.' introduces a legal contradiction. While the initial statement mandates full compliance with the FCPA, this addition suggests that WPD's subjective interpretation of the law determines compliance, potentially undermining the FCPA's intended enforcement and introducing ambiguity.",

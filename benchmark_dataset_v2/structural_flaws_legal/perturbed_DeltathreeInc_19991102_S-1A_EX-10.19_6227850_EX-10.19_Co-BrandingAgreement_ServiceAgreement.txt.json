This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. For purposes of this\n\nSource: DELTATHREE INC, S-1/A, 11/2/1999\n\nAgreement, each party hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, sitting in New York County, and the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party. In any such suit, action or proceeding, each party waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons, complaint or other process and agrees that the service thereof may be made by certified or registered mail, addressed to such party at its address set forth in Section 9.03  [Notices]. Each party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding.",

This agreement is subject to the laws of New York, unless those laws conflict with the general principles of fairness and equity, in which case, the governing law will be decided by mutual agreement. Jurisdiction will be in New York, unless it proves unduly burdensome.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces a contradiction. It states the agreement is subject to New York law, but then introduces a condition where that law might be superseded by 'general principles of fairness and equity,' and a method to determine the governing law after that. This undermines the certainty and enforceability of the original governing law clause. The reference to 'unduly burdensome' further undermines the jurisdiction.",

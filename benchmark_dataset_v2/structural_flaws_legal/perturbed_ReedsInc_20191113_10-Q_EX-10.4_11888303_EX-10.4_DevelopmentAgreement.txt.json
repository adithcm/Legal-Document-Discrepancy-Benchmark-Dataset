EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.",
                "changed_text": "11. Press Releases; Publicity. Reed's may issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the relationship of the parties, subject to Company's prior approval of any such press release or other public announcement which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood that such consent shall not be required in the case of any public announcement required by any law, regulation, regulatory body or the rules of any exchange to which Reed's is or may become subject. Company shall not publicly identify Reed's or use Reed's name in any manner in connection with this Agreement without Reed's prior written approval.\n\n10. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.",
                "explanation": "Moving the Limitation of Liability clause under the Press Releases and Publicity Section buries this crucial financial term in an area that has nothing to do with financial liabilities or contractual obligations. This is a structural flaw that affects clarity because readers may not expect to find the limitation of liability in a section discussing press releases. Limitation of liability clause is expected to be in sections regarding Liability or Indemnification.",

                "original_text": "14. Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by, and any dispute arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with, the laws of State of New York (without giving effect to conflict of laws principles) including all matters of construction, validity and performance. The parties agree that any claim or dispute arising under this Agreement shall be resolved by a court located in New York City, New York.",
                "changed_text": "17. Waiver. A provision of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party waiving compliance. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure of either party to exercise promptly any right, power or privilege granted by this Agreement, or to require strict performance of any obligation undertaken by the other party pursuant to this Agreement, will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right, power or privilege or of the right to demand subsequent performance of any and all such obligations undertaken by the other party.\n\n14. Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by, and any dispute arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with, the laws of State of Oregon (without giving effect to conflict of laws principles) including all matters of construction, validity and performance. The parties agree that any claim or dispute arising under this Agreement shall be resolved by a court located in Hood River, Oregon.",
                "explanation": "Switching the designated governing law and venue from New York to Oregon, and placing it after the Waiver clause, creates confusion. The contract initially specifies New York law, but now it is Oregon, and it's buried after a section about waiving provisions. This could be considered misleading because parties might rely on the initial New York jurisdiction without easily noticing the change embedded later, especially as Full Sail Brewing Company is located in Oregon. This affects enforceability because the intended jurisdiction is obscured.",

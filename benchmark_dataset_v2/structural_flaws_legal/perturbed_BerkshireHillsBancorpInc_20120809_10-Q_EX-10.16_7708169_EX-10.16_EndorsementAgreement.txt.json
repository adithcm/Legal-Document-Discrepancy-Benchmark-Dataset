                "explanation": "Modifying the governing law clause introduces uncertainty. While the original specifies Connecticut law, the changed text allows for 'mutual agreement,' potentially leading to disputes over which state's laws apply and hindering enforcement, violating general principles of contract law requiring clarity and certainty.",

ARBITRATION.\n\nAny dispute or difference between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with\nthe Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of three qualified arbitrators.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration under AAA rules. The modified clause makes arbitration optional ('may be settled') and removes the AAA requirement, allowing for uncertainty and potentially conflicting dispute resolution methods, making the arbitration clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "This modification severely restricts the indemnity clause. Originally, Berkshire indemnified Auriemma for various claims. The revised text adds a strict 30-day notice requirement, regardless of when Auriemma becomes aware of the claim. This reduces Berkshire's liability and allows them to avoid indemnification due to Auriemma's potential lack of awareness, contradicting common law principles that indemnify provisions should be reasonably and fairly applied.",

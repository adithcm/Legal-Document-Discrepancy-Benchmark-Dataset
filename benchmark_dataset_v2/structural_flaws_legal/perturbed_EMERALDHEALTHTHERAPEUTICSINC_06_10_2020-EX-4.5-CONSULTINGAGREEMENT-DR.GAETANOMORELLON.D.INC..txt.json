                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "8.4 Governing Law and Attornment. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable in British Columbia, and the parties irrevocably submit to and accept generally and unconditionally the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and appellate courts of British Columbia in that regard.",
                "changed_text": "8.4 Governing Law and Attornment. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with laws determined at the discretion of Emerald Health Naturals, Inc., and the parties submit to a jurisdiction also determined at the discretion of Emerald Health Naturals, Inc.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies British Columbia law and jurisdiction. The modified clause introduces ambiguity and grants Emerald Health Naturals, Inc. the discretion to choose the governing law and jurisdiction, potentially undermining the contractor's legal protections. This contradicts standard legal practice where governing law is clearly defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract law principles requiring clarity and mutual agreement on governing jurisdiction.",

The Contractor may terminate this Agreement and his or her engagement for any reason at any time upon providing 30 days advance notice in writing to Emerald. Termination will be effective, at Emeralds' election, on a date which is no earlier than the date such notice is received and no later than the date which is 30 days following that date.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Contractor's Right to Terminate Agreement for any Reason. The Contractor may terminate this Agreement; however, Emerald retains the right to nullify said termination without cause, if it is believed to affect business operations.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows the contractor to terminate for any reason with 30 days notice. The modified clause gives Emerald the right to nullify the termination if it affects business operations, effectively negating the contractor's right to terminate at will. This creates a contradiction, undermining the original intent and enforceability of the contractor's termination rights.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states a firm commitment to pay the contractor an annual fee. By changing 'will' to 'may' and adding the caveat that payment is subject to the company's discretion, a contradiction is introduced. This weakens the contractor's right to receive the agreed-upon compensation, making it contingent on subjective factors controlled by the company.",

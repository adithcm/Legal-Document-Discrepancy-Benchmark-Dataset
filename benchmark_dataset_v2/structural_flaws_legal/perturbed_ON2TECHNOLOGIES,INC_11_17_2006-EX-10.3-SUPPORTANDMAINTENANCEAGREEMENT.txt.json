                "original_text": "10.8 Dispute Resolution. Disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved as follows:\n\n      (a) General Intent. The parties intend that all problems and disputes relating to this Agreement or arising from the transactions contemplated hereby (\"Disputes\") shall be resolved through the procedures of this Section 10.8; provided, however, that neither party shall be under any obligation to proceed in accordance with this Section 10.8 with respect to Disputes concerning any alleged breach of Article V of this Agreement, as to which a party may take any legal action in a court of law or equity (without the necessity of posting any bond) to assert or enforce a claim that it has against the other party under this Agreement. The procedures in this Section 10.8 shall not replace or supersede any other remedy to which a party is entitled under this Agreement or under applicable law.\n\n      (b) Informal Resolution Efforts. The parties shall initially attempt to resolve Disputes through informal negotiations conducted by the Primary Coordinator of Wildform and Primary Coordinator of On2.\n\n      (c) Mediation. If a Dispute cannot be resolved under Subsection 10.8(b) above, the Dispute shall be submitted to mediation by written notice of the party seeking mediation to the other party. In the mediation process, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve their differences voluntarily with the aid of an impartial mediator, who will attempt to facilitate negotiations. The mediator shall be selected by agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, the American Arbitration Association or JAMS shall designate a mediator at the request of either party. Any mediator so designated must be acceptable to both parties. The mediation shall be confidential, and the mediator may not testify for either party in any later proceeding relating to the Dispute. Each party shall bear its own costs in the mediation. The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally by the parties.\n\n      (d) Court Actions. If the parties cannot resolve a Dispute through mediation pursuant to Subsection 10.8(c) above, either party may seek further redress by taking legal action in a court of law or equity to assert or enforce a claim that it has against the other party under this Agreement. The parties agree that any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to\n\n\n\nthis Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be instituted by a party in a Federal or state court sitting in the jurisdiction and venue of the other party, which shall be the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of said legal proceedings and each party hereto waives any objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against such party (or the subsidiary of such party) when transmitted in accordance with Section 10.8. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any manner permitted by law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates certain procedures, including an initial attempt at informal resolution and then mediation, before court actions. The modified clause introduces ambiguity and optionality. It states that parties 'may' attempt informal negotiations but are not required, mediation is optional, and parties can pursue legal action in any venue. This contradicts the original intent of structured dispute resolution, potentially leading to immediate court actions and increased legal costs, undermining the enforceability of the intended dispute resolution process.",

                "explanation": "The original 'Entire Agreement' clause clearly states that modifications require a written instrument executed by both parties. The added phrase, 'unless both parties verbally agree to the changes,' directly contradicts this. This introduces a legal contradiction, creating ambiguity about the validity of verbal agreements. It weakens the enforceability of the written contract by suggesting that verbal agreements can override the written terms, which violates the Statute of Frauds principle that requires certain agreements to be in writing to be enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a clear payment structure, including a cash payment and the issuance of Payment Shares on a specific date. The added phrase, 'unless On2 finds the shares to be worth less than the expected value,' introduces a subjective condition that allows On2 to potentially avoid issuing the Payment Shares based on its own valuation. This contradicts the original agreement for a fixed payment, creates uncertainty, and could be interpreted as a failure to provide the agreed-upon consideration, rendering the clause and potentially the agreement less enforceable.",

                "explanation": "The agreement originally specifies Michigan law to govern disputes. Changing this to Texas law, or 'the location the case is filed', introduces a legal contradiction because it creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws will apply. This could make enforcement more difficult as parties might argue over the applicable legal framework. Additionally, it contradicts the standard practice of contracts explicitly stating the governing law to ensure predictability and avoid jurisdictional disputes.",

Transporter may file and seek Commission approval under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) at any time and from time to time to change any rates, charges or provisions set forth in the applicable Rate Schedule (as stated above) and the \"General Terms and Conditions\" in Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, and Transporter shall have the right to place such changes in effect in accordance with the NGA, and this Agreement shall be deemed to include such changes and any such changes\n\nwhich become effective by operation of law and Commission Order, without prejudice to Shipper's right to protest the same.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"without prejudice to Shipper's right to protest the same,\" the modified text creates a contradiction. The original text acknowledges the shipper's right to protest changes filed by the transporter. The modified text implies the shipper has no right to protest, directly conflicting with the original intention and potentially violating regulations that ensure fair processes for all parties, and eliminating the right of the shipper.",

OTHER PROVISIONS:\n\nIt is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.\n\nUpon termination of this Agreement, Shipper's and Transporter's obligations to each other arising under this Agreement, prior to the date of termination, remain in effect and are not being terminated by any provision of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Removing the word 'no' in the clause regarding personal liability creates a direct contradiction. The original clause explicitly states that no personal liability will attach to the listed individuals, while the changed clause implies personal liability may occur.

Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party, as of the Effective Date, as follows:\n\n(g) Anti-Corruption. Such Party shall not, directly or indirectly through Third Parties, pay, promise or offer to pay, or authorize the payment of, any money or give any promise or offer to give, or authorize the giving of anything of value to a Public Official or Entity or other Person for purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any Person, including, without limitation, Zogenix or Distributor. Without any limitation to the foregoing, such Party has not and shall not directly or indirectly promise, offer or provide any corrupt payment, gratuity, emolument, bribe, kickback, illicit gift or hospitality or other illegal or unethical benefit to a Public Official or Entity or any other Person.",

Such Party shall not, directly or indirectly through Third Parties, pay, promise or offer to pay, or authorize the payment of, any money or give any promise or offer to give, or authorize the giving of anything of value to a Public Official or Entity or other Person for purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any Person, including, without limitation, Zogenix or Distributor.

                "explanation": "Moving the anti-corruption clause to the section discussing headings creates a structural flaw. The anti-corruption clause contains crucial legal obligations, and placing it under 'Headings' misleads parties about its relevance and reduces its enforceability. This violates the spirit of FCPA compliance, which requires clear and prominent placement of such clauses.",

The arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.",

During the Term, without the prior written approval of Zogenix, Distributor shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, either directly or indirectly, file for Regulatory Approval of, promote, market, offer for sale, sell, import or distribute in the Territory any product containing fenfluramine or any salt, enantiomer, or polymorph of fenfluramine, or any product for [***].\n\n13.3 (a) Any and all disputes that are not resolved pursuant to Section 13.2 shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered under mutual agreement by both parties.",
                "explanation": "Relocating the arbitration clause to the Non-compete Covenant makes it easy to overlook. Furthermore, the 'mutual agreement' clause replaces any explicit legal method. This introduces uncertainty since some jurisdictions may require binding arbitration agreements to follow international chamber of commerce rules. By not following these rules, the enforceability is questionable.",

Any taxes imposed on Distributor or with respect to Distributor's business operations or activities hereunder, including any value added taxes, consumption, transfer, sales, use or other such taxes relating to the transactions contemplated herein, shall be borne by Distributor, and Distributor shall timely pay, and indemnify and hold harmless, Zogenix from and against all such taxes, including any penalties or interest associated therewith. If Distributor is required by Applicable Law to deduct and withhold taxes from a payment due and payable to Zogenix hereunder (excluding national, state or local taxes based on income to Zogenix), Distributor shall: (a) promptly notify Zogenix of such requirement; (b) make such required deduction and withholding from the corresponding payment; (c) pay to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so deducted and withheld; and (d) promptly forward to Zogenix an official receipt or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Zogenix evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority(ies). The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their mutual objective and intent to minimize, to the extent feasible under the Applicable Laws, any taxes payable in connection with this Agreement, and shall reasonably cooperate each other in good faith in accordance with Applicable Laws to minimize any Taxes in connection with this Agreement, including provision of any tax forms and other information that may be reasonably necessary in order for the paying Party not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty.",

                "explanation": "Relocating tax liabilities to trademark rights introduces confusion, where financial obligations should be clearly stated in payment terms. The phrase 'shall be something the Distributor shall bear, and is not responsible for,' introduces contradictionâ€”it suggests the distributor is responsible (bears the cost) but then absolves them of responsibility, undermining clarity. Some tax regulations require explicit responsibility.",

THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, CURE OR PREVENT ANY DISEASE.\"",

The product may or may not be intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\"",
                "explanation": "The original disclaimer clearly states that the product is 'not intended' to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, as required by FDA regulations for dietary supplements. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'may or may not' regarding FDA evaluation and intended purpose, weakening the clarity of the disclaimer and its enforceability. This creates a legal contradiction because it no longer definitively complies with the requirement for a clear disclaimer.",

Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term. Talent may use said materials in whole or in part solely for the purpose of presenting Talent's work in Talent's personal portfolio, website or otherwise and/or on Talent's agent's website. Such usage may not be sold or transferred.",

ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term.

Such usage may not be sold or transferred.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides clear guidelines for approval of the Talent's Attributes, setting a specific timeframe of five business days, but the modified text introduces uncertainty by changing 'shall be' to 'may be' and replacing 'five business days' with 'a reasonable time'. This creates ambiguity regarding whether prior written approval is required and how long the talent has to make a decision. The lack of a fixed timeframe could lead to disputes and makes the clause less enforceable because it is not clear what 'reasonable time' means.",

                "explanation": "The original choice of law clause unequivocally specifies that Michigan law governs the entire agreement. The modified clause introduces an exception, stating that Florida law will govern disputes over Talent's image. This creates a contradiction because it segments the contract, potentially leading to confusion about which state's laws apply in different situations. This is especially problematic given the agreement involves endorsements and potential image-related claims.",

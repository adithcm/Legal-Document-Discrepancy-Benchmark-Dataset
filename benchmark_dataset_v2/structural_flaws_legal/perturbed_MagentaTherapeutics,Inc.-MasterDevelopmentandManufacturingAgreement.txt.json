The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiations between executives who have authority to settle the controversy. Any party may give the other party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within [***] after delivery of said notice, executives of both parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place in the State of New York or as otherwise agreed and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to resolve the dispute. Once the executive of either party determines that additional meetings are not likely to resolve the dispute, each of the parties shall be entitled to terminate such meetings and the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration. The binding arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules and procedures for commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. Unless the parties to such dispute agree otherwise in writing, any such arbitration shall be conducted in New York pursuant to New York law, without any consideration of conflict of law issues, and the results of such arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that each of them shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief through the courts in the event of any material breach by the other party of any provision of this Agreement that would cause the non-breaching party irreparable injury for which there would be no adequate remedy at law. Any such legal proceeding will be brought in the applicable state or federal court of the State of New York, and the parties hereby consent to this exclusive jurisdiction for this purpose.",

                "explanation": "By changing the terms of the dispute resolution, the language becomes unclear, introducing contradictionâ€”the first part states resolution shall be a method of their choosing, but the latter part allows for 'mutual agreement' on the dispute resolution method. This contradicts the clause's requirements, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

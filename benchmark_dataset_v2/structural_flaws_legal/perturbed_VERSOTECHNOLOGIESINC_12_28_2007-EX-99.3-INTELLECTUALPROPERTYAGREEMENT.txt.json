                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Intellectual Property Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Intellectual Property Agreement.\n\nThis Intellectual Property Agreement shall be construed and interpreted according to principles of equity and fairness, as determined at the sole discretion of Buyer. The laws of a jurisdiction selected by Buyer shall govern, even if that jurisdiction has no connection to the parties or the subject matter of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause has been moved to a section dealing with execution and counterparts, making it less prominent. The original clause stating Georgia law applies has been replaced with a clause allowing the Buyer to select the governing law, potentially conflicting with standard contract law principles requiring a reasonable connection to the jurisdiction. This creates a contradiction and uncertainty regarding which laws apply, diminishing enforceability under Georgia law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause compels the Seller to execute further documents at Backhaul's expense to ensure the transfer of intellectual property. The modified clause introduces a contradiction by stating that Seller's obligation is contingent upon Seller's sole discretion, undermining the original mandatory nature of the clause. The clause now leaves the obligation to future agreement and negotiation, thus the duty to preform is not present until the later decision is made.",

Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Nantz Communications and Nantz, on the other hand, shall select one arbitrator and the two so selected shall select a third.  Failing the selection of an arbitrator by either party or by the two so selected, the claim or controversy shall be settled by the American Arbitration Association upon the application of either party.  Judgment upon any award of a majority of the arbitrators filed in a court of competent jurisdiction shall be binding.",

Should all parties agree, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, may be settled by arbitration. The judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. This clause is entirely optional and does not obligate any party to participate in arbitration.",

The modified clause makes arbitration optional, contradicting the original intent and potentially violating requirements for clear dispute resolution procedures. It also places the clause in the 'MISCELLANEOUS' section, renamed it Arbitration (Optional), further obscuring its importance.",

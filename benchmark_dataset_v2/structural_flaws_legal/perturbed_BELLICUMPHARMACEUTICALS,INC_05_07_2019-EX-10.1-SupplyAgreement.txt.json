                "original_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") pursuant to this Agreement which is (a) in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\" or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or (b) oral information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to a written summary by the Disclosing Party, within thirty (30) calendar days after its oral disclosure, which is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Disclosing Party's failure to so mark any of its Confidential Information, whether disclosed in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form, or its failure to designate as confidential and reduce to writing any Confidential Information disclosed orally, shall not relieve the Receiving Party of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Confidential Information if its confidential nature would be apparent to a reasonable person in the biotechnology or biopharmaceutical industry, based on the subject matter of such Confidential Information or the circumstances under which it is disclosed.",
                "changed_text": "As used in Section 19.2 of this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") pursuant to this Agreement which is (a) in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\" or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or (b) oral information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The Receiving Party is not obligated to protect Confidential Information.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the definition of 'Confidential Information' to Section 19.2 and removing the protection clause, the contract creates confusion about whether confidentiality obligations apply across the entire agreement. The lack of a clear obligation jeopardizes the protection of sensitive business information.",

                "explanation": "By stipulating that parties only need to act to receive payments, the clause invalidates a party's responsibility to perform activities essential for the agreement's operation, including product delivery, regulatory compliance, and quality control. This reduces the overall enforceability of the contract.",

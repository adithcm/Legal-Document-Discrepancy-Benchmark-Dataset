(a) This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Ohio (without regard to conflicts of law provisions), as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within the State of Ohio between Ohio residents. (b) Any dispute between the Parties concerning the scope or interpretation of this Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in effect on the date that a dispute is submitted to arbitration (the \"Rules\"). The arbitration shall be held in Canton, Ohio, and shall be before a panel of three arbitrators, one chosen by each of the Parties and a third chosen by the two arbitrators so chosen by the Parties. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the arbitration, each Party shall submit to the other the documents and a list of witnesses it intends to interview or call in the arbitration. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive law of the State of Ohio with regard to any dispute that becomes the subject of arbitration, and the arbitrators will be so instructed. The arbitrators shall issue a written opinion stating the findings of fact and the conclusions of law upon which the decision is based. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.",

                "explanation": "The modified clause introduces uncertainty and contradiction. Originally, arbitration was binding, held in a specific location (Canton, Ohio), and decided by a panel of three arbitrators under Ohio law. The revised clause allows for a 'mutually agreed upon location', which contradicts the original fixed location, and the law to be applied will be decided by the parties involved. The decision of the arbitrator is now subject to appeal, contradicting the original clause's provision that the arbitrators decision shall be final and binding. This restructuring undermines the original intent of binding and conclusive arbitration under Ohio law.",

Except in the instance of gross negligence, the terms of indemnification are void.",
                "explanation": "This revision introduces a significant legal contradiction. The original clause outlines PFHOF's indemnification obligations clearly. By adding 'Except in the instance of gross negligence, the terms of indemnification are void', the clause effectively nullifies the indemnification agreement, except in cases of gross negligence. This contradicts the original purpose of the indemnification clause, which was to protect the Village Media Company from various liabilities, even if PFHOF was not grossly negligent. The standard for gross negligence is difficult to meet.",

The Parties are only required to comply with the laws if it is economically feasible.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence, 'The Parties are only required to comply with the laws if it is economically feasible,' introduces a contradiction and undermines the original clause's intent. The original clause mandates compliance with all applicable laws. However, the added phrase provides an 'out'—compliance is only required if it's economically feasible. This contradicts the fundamental legal obligation to comply with laws and regulations regardless of economic feasibility. It creates ambiguity and makes the entire compliance clause unenforceable since a party could argue that compliance is too expensive, rendering the legal requirement optional.",

Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive] below, any controversy or claim arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally.\n25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the Owners must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed. The parties waive all questions of personal jurisdiction and venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.\n25.3. Mutual Waiver of Class Actions. Any lawsuit, claim, counterclaim, or other action may be conducted only on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action.\n25.4. Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial. You and we each irrevocably waive trial by jury in any litigation.\n25.5. Mutual Waiver of Punitive Damages. Each of us waives any right to or claim of punitive, exemplary, multiple, or consequential damages against the other in litigation and agrees to be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained.\n25.6 Time Period to Bring Claims. Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the relationship between you and us, or your operation of the Restaurant, brought by any party hereto against the other, must be commenced within one (1) year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed by all parties, such claim or action will be irrevocably barred.\n25.7. Remedies Not Exclusive. Except as provided in Sections 25.1 [Submission to Mediation] through 25.4 [Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial] above, no right or remedy that the parties have under this Agreement is exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or under applicable law.\n25.8. Our Right to Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Agreement bars our right to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement that will cause us loss or damage. You agree that we will not be required to prove actual damages or post a bond or other security in seeking or obtaining injunctive relief (both preliminary and permanent) and/or specific performance.\n25.9. Attorneys Fees and Costs. You agree to reimburse us for all expenses we reasonably incur (including attorneys' fees):\n(a) to enforce the terms of this Agreement or any obligation owed to us by you and/or the Owners; and\n(b) in the defense of any claim you and/or the Owners assert against us upon which we substantially prevail in court, arbitration, mediation, or other formal legal proceedings.",

With respect to the Owners, the time period in Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] will run from the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement or from the termination of the Owner's relationship with you, whichever occurs first. You must also require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Section 12 above, and this Section 17 (as modified to apply to an individual), from any or all of the following persons: your officers, directors, and their respective spouses and employees.

The initial franchise fee is paid in consideration of the rights granted in Section 1 and is fully earned at the time paid. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to refund the initial franchise fee in whole or in part for any reason.\n3.2. Royalty\n3.2.1. You must pay us a royalty fee (\"Royalty\") equal to six percent (6%) of your Gross Revenues. The Royalty is in consideration of your right to use the Proprietary Marks and the System in accordance with this Agreement, and not in exchange for any specific services we render. If by reason of state or other law, we are prohibited from receiving a percentage of certain components of Gross Revenues (including alcoholic-beverage sales), you must pay us an equivalent amount by increasing the Royalty percentage applied to Gross Revenues exclusive of the prohibited components.\n3.2.2. You must calculate and pay the Royalty weekly, based on your Gross Revenues for the previous Period. For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise designated by us in writing, a \"Period\" begins on Monday and ends on the following Sunday.\n3.2.3. \"Gross Revenues\" means all revenue from the sale of all services and products and all other income of every kind and nature related to, derived from, or originating from the Franchised Business, including proceeds of any business interruption insurance policies, whether for cash or credit, and regardless of collection in the case of credit; provided, however, that \"Gross Revenues\" does not include any coupon sales (for which customers do not pay for product), customer refunds, sales taxes or other taxes you collected from customers and actually transmitted to the appropriate taxing authorities.\n3.3. Advertising Contributions. During any Period that the Marketing Fund (as defined in Section 9.1 [Pizza Fusion Marketing Fund] below) is in effect, you must make a contribution as described in Section 9.1 [Pizza Fusion Marketing Fund] below equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Revenues for the preceding Period. Additionally, during any Period that a Regional Fund (as defined in Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below) for the area in which your Franchised Business is located is in effect, you must make a contribution as described in Section 9.2 [Local Marketing] below in such amounts as we specify in writing up to two percent (2%) of your Gross Revenues for the preceding Period; in addition, you may be required to contribute to a Regional Fund up to an additional two percent (2%) of Gross Revenues of your Franchised Business if the members of that Regional Fund vote to increase the total contribution, as provided in Section 9.3.5 [Regional Fund] below. Required contributions to the Marketing Fund and Regional Fund are referred to as \"Advertising Contributions.\"\n3.4. Index. The parties agree that all fixed dollar amounts set out in this Agreement are subject to adjustment, up or down, depending on changes in the Index. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term \"Index\" is agreed to mean the Consumer Price Index (1982-84=100: all items; CPI- U; all urban consumers) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (or if the Index is no longer published, a successor index that we may reasonably specify in the Manuals or otherwise in writing). We have the right to decide whether or not to make adjustments to fixed dollar amounts set out in this Agreement and if we decide to invoke that right, we will make changes not more than once each year by sending you written notice of the change.\n3.5. Due Date for Payment. Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each Period (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week). You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice from us.\n3.6. Method of Payment. You must make all payments to us by the method or methods that we specify from time to time. We require payment via wire transfer or electronic debit to your bank account, and you must maintain sufficient balance in your operating account to meet the payment requirements. You must furnish us and your bank with all authorizations necessary to effect payment by the methods we specify. You may not, under any circumstances, set off, deduct or otherwise withhold any Royalty fees, Advertising Contributions, interest charges, or any other monies payable under this Agreement on grounds of our alleged non-performance of any obligations. Additionally, you authorize us to charge against any of your credit cards any amounts due to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to supply us a written list of all of your credit cards (including card number, name, and expiration date) and to update that list periodically, if there are changes to the information.\n3.7. Delinquency. If any Royalties or other amounts owed to us are not paid in full by the due date, we have the right to charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, if less than 1.5%) from the date such amount was due until paid in full. Unpaid interest charges will compound annually. In addition, we will have the right to charge a late fee for each occurrence of a payment that is more than 30 days past due, which fee will be $100 for the first such occurrence, $200 for the second such occurrence, and $300 for the third and each subsequent occurrence during the Term of this Agreement. The late fee is to compensate us for our administrative costs incurred in enforcing your obligation to pay us.\n3.8. Dishonored Payments. For any amount that you must pay to us or our affiliates, if we are not able to successfully complete a wire transfer or electronic debit for such payment as described Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] above, or if a check that you issue for such payment is returned by the bank against which it was drawn, due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s) or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment (each a \"Dishonored Payment\"), we have the right to charge a fee of $100 per occurrence (a \"Dishonored Payment Charge\"). We will notify you of each Dishonored Payment and any Dishonored Payment Charge that we impose. We may add the Dishonored Payment Charge to the amount to be paid via the next wire transfer or electronic debit. The Dishonored Payment Charge applies in addition to any late fee and interest that we have the right to charge, or any other remedy to which we are entitled, under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.\n3.9 Taxes. You are responsible for all taxes levied or assessed on you or the Franchised Business in connection with your activities under this Agreement.\n3.10 Obligations Absolute. You agree that your obligations to pay us (as well as our affiliates) under this Agreement or any other agreement in connection to the Franchised Business are absolute and unconditional, and not subject to abatement or setoff for past or future claims that you may assert.\n3.11 Security Agreement. Upon our written request, you agree to grant to us a first-priority security interest in all of your assets (including all proceeds thereof and after-acquired property), as security for all your monetary and other obligations to us or our affiliates arising under or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement. Such assets include all furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, inventory and all other property, (tangible or intangible), that you now own or later acquire, used in connection with the Franchised Business, and wheresoever located as well as all contractual and related rights you have under this Agreement and all other agreements between the parties. If we request, you must execute such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents as we may require in order to perfect and maintain our security interest, including but not limited to a UCC-1 Financing Statement. Alternatively, you authorize us to execute any of the foregoing financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments, and/or other documents on your behalf, or on our own (in our name), describing the collateral in such manner as we consider appropriate. You hereby grant us an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest, to execute, in your name, any of such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents.

Boxlot shall not provide Boxlot Banners or Boxlot Content, and theglobe shall not provide to Boxlot any Page Templates, that: (a) infringe any third party's intellectual property right or right of publicity or privacy; (b) violate any law or regulation; (c) are defamatory, obscene, harmful to minors or child pornographic; (d) contain any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; or (e) are materially false, inaccurate or misleading.

                "explanation": "The original clause 12.1 explicitly demands compliance with laws. Moving this into 'Standards' reduces its visibility as a comprehensive legal obligation, associating it more with content standards than with overall regulatory compliance. This may make enforcement of the compliance obligation more difficult.",

                "explanation": "Governing law clauses are meant to be stand alone in the general section. Moving the governing law clause to the section on 'Boxlot Banners' obscures its importance, making it less likely to be noticed or readily understood as the overarching legal framework.",

                "explanation": "Disclaimers of warranties are typically standalone and clearly emphasized. Placing it within the section on 'Payments' makes it seem like it only applies to payments, not to the entire agreement. This limits the scope and potential enforceability of the disclaimer.",

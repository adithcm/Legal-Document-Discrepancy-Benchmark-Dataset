Any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to, connected with, or arising out of this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Law, before a single arbitrator to agreed upon by both parties and in lack of such agreement as to the identity of the arbitrator, each side shall be eligible, within 7 days of any notice given by any party to the other, to request that the head of the Tel-Aviv Bar Association appoint said arbitrator.",

Ordering, Pricing, and Payment Procedures 5.1 Non-Binding Forecasts. On the first day of each calendar quarter, the Reseller will provide Todos with a non-binding rolling weekly forecast of the Reseller's estimated Product purchase requirements over the upcoming six months (the \"Forecasts\"). 5.2 Orders. From time to time as needed, the Reseller shall provide Todos with firm purchase orders for the Products. Each purchase order shall include the name and address of the Customer. All orders are subject to written acceptance by Todos, which acceptance shall be provided unless the order contains terms that differ from the terms set forth in this Agreement. 5.3 Product Price. The Reseller shall be entitled to purchase the Products from Todos for resale to Customers at a price between US$[ ] and US$[ ], with the actual price to be agreed upon by the Parties (the \"Product Price\"). At the end of each year this Agreement is in effect, the Parties will discuss each party's costs and whether to revise the Product Price. Todos shall provide the Reseller with Products for clinical trials at no charge. Any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to, connected with, or arising out of this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be subject to non-binding mediation before litigation.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause is moved from the 'Miscellaneous' section to be included within the 'Ordering, Pricing, and Payment Procedures' section. The changed text replaces the binding arbitration clause with a non-binding mediation clause. This relocation buries the dispute resolution process within financial terms. The final wording makes resolution of disputes non-binding, undermining the enforceability of the agreement.",

No relationship of principal to agent, master to servant, employer to employee, or franchisor to franchisee is established hereby between the parties. Neither party has the authority to bind the other or incur any obligation on the other's behalf. Any agreement for the sale of Products negotiated or executed between the Reseller and a Customer shall be binding upon the Reseller alone. The Reseller is not authorized to, and shall not, enter into any contracts nor make any other commitments on behalf of or in the name of Todos, unless expressly authorized in writing to do so by Todos. Reseller shall not incur any liabilities, obligations, or commitments on behalf of Todos. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS SECTION 7, TODOS DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, INLCUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, DURABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The warranty applies only if Todos receives written notice of the alleged defect within one year of the purchase date.",
                "explanation": "The disclaimer of warranties is moved to the 'Relationship of the Parties' section. This obscures a key protection for the Reseller. The addition of 'The warranty applies only if Todos receives written notice of the alleged defect within one year of the purchase date' introduces a subtle but significant change, potentially weakening consumer rights by emphasizing notification requirements, which might not be prominently displayed or easily understood by the Reseller.",

This Agreement, including its exhibits, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements, representations, discussions, negotiations, and agreements, both oral and written. 15.2 Amendments or Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except in a writing signed by authorized officers of both parties. No order, invoice, or similar document will modify the terms of this Agreement even if accepted by the receiving party. 15.3 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be found to be illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and such term or provision shall be deemed severed unless such severance defeats the purpose of this Agreement or results in substantial injustice to one of the parties. 15.4 No Waiver. Neither of the party's rights to enforce provisions of this Agreement shall be affected by any prior course of dealing, waiver, delay, omission, or forbearance. 15.5 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder shall not be assigned, encumbered by security interest or otherwise transferred by the Reseller without the prior written consent of Todos, except for the assignment or transfer of rights to a subsidiary company or an affiliated company. 15.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, and the courts of Tel-Aviv, Israel. The Reseller will forward any adverse events to the company.",
                "explanation": "Moving the medical device reporting requirement to the 'Miscellaneous' section makes it less visible and harder to find. Removing the reference to 'Mandatory Medical Device Reporting regulations of 21 CFR 803' and replacing it with a vague 'The Reseller will forward any adverse events to the company' weakens the clause. This change reduces the Reseller's obligation to comply with specific medical device reporting regulations.",

                "original_text": "5. Master Framework Agreement. This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Sections 4 (Confidentiality) and 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4. Continuation. This Amendment will apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Non- Competition Agreement specifically referred to herein. Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the Non-Competition Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.\n\n5. Master Framework Agreement. This Amendment is governed by the Master Framework Agreement, *except for* Sections 4 (Confidentiality) and 6 (Miscellaneous) of the Master Framework Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By excluding the Confidentiality and Miscellaneous sections of the Master Framework Agreement, the enforceability of confidentiality obligations related to the non-compete is weakened. Confidentiality is a crucial component of non-compete agreements; therefore, separating it diminishes the enforceability of the agreement.",

This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date, and will continue until the expiration of the \"Sales Term\" as that term is defined in the Sales Dealer Agreement dated as of August 16, 2017 between Vivint and Vivint Solar Developer, LLC (the \"Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vivint Solar may terminate the non-solicitation agreement at any time, with or without cause, with thirty (30) days notice to Vivint, Inc.\"",
                "explanation": "This adds a clause permitting Vivint Solar to terminate the non-solicitation agreement at any time. This drastically reduces the enforceability of the non-solicitation provision, as it creates a loophole allowing them to essentially bypass the agreement.",

                "explanation": "By adding a condition that allows the non-competition agreement to stand if Vivint violates the *spirit* of the non-competition agreement, introduces ambiguity and subjectivity into its interpretation and enforcement. The 'spirit' is undefined, making it contestable and weakening its enforceability.",

Arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator mutually acceptable to the parties and experienced in the matters at issue and selected by the Parties in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single arbitrator, each party shall select an arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator. The arbitration shall only be held in New York, New York. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter or either of the Parties, except that each party reserves all rights of appeal. The arbitrator(s) shall determine to what extent each of the Parties shall bear the costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) on the basis of the arbitrator's assessment of the relative merits of the Parties' positions.",

Each Party will comply with all applicable Laws and the Operating Regulations, governmental requirements, and industry standards, including those with respect to privacy, data protection, portability, or accountability, applicable to such Party or its personnel with respect to the Software, the Services, and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement; provided that Allscripts will have no obligation to comply with any Operating Regulations unless such Operating Regulations are disclosed to it. Neither Party will, nor permit any third parties to, export, re-export, or release, directly or indirectly, any Controlled Technology to any country or jurisdiction to which the export, re-export, or release of any Controlled Technology (a) is prohibited by applicable Law or (b) without first completing all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval).",

Allscripts will provide Company with a non-binding [***] sales forecast for Allscripts' sales of eligibility and payment processing solutions during [***] within [***] of the Effective Date.\n\n14.5 Compliance with Laws. Each Party will comply with some Laws and industry standards applicable to its personnel with respect to the Software, the Services, and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement; provided that Allscripts will have no obligation to comply with any Operating Regulations unless such Operating Regulations are disclosed to it. Neither Party will, nor permit any third parties to, export, re-export, or release, directly or indirectly, some Controlled Technology to some countries.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates full compliance with all applicable laws, which is crucial for enforceability. The modified clause uses vague language like 'some Laws' and 'some countries'. By weakening the commitment to full compliance and making it unclear which laws and jurisdictions apply, this significantly reduces the enforceability of the clause. It's now uncertain to what extent each party is legally bound, creating a legal loophole.",

                "explanation": "Removing the reference to the HIPAA BAA and stating that privacy and security are not covered effectively nullifies the privacy obligations and introduces a blatant legal contradiction. HIPAA requires a BAA for handling PHI; stating it's not covered makes the contract non-compliant and unenforceable with respect to PHI handling, potentially exposing both parties to HIPAA violations.",

The arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1 et seq. Arbitration awards will be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of the arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois. All aspects of the arbitration and any award will be confidential (subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 19.3).",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings ascribed thereto in this Section 1:\n\n\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. Allscripts' Affiliates may exercise Allscripts' rights and fulfill its related obligations under this Agreement, provided that Allscripts shall be responsible for any breach of such obligations by its Affiliates to the same extent as if Allscripts was the breaching party. Subject to the foregoing, any dispute arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement which cannot be settled amicably will be finally resolved by mutual agreement",
                "explanation": "By relocating the dispute resolution clause to the definitions section and changing it from a structured arbitration process to a simple 'mutual agreement,' the enforceability is severely undermined. The mandatory arbitration process, which ensures a structured and legally binding dispute resolution, is replaced with a vague requirement for mutual agreement, which might not be legally binding and provides no clear method for resolving conflicts.",

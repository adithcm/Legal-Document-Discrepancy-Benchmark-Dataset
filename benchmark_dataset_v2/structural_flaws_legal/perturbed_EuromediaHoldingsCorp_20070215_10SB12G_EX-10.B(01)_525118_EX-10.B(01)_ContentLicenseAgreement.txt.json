                "explanation": "By introducing uncertainty and weakening the original representations and warranties, the changes make enforcement more difficult. It is less clear if the party fully complies to all the regulations, resulting in a partial compliance in the agreement and shifting the responsibility of compliance to both parties. The use of 'attempt', 'cannot guarantee' and 'may not' contradict the original commitment and create a structural flaw.",

                "explanation": "The modified text contradicts the Ontario governing law by stating that the parties can mutually agree on an alternative jurisdiction during a legal dispute.

                "explanation": "Adding 'or any other affiliated company' broadens Rogers's ability to assign the contract without consent, potentially diminishing Licensor's rights. The phrase 'unless otherwise determined by Licensor' introduces a contradiction, allowing Licensor to arbitrarily decide if a change of control constitutes an assignment, undermining the predictability of the original clause.",

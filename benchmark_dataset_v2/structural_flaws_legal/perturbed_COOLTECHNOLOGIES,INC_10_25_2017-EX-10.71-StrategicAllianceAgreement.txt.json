                "original_text": "Each of VET TECH and COOL TECH, at its own expense, shall indemnify, defend and hold the other, its partners, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all third-party suits, actions, investigations and proceedings, and related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting solely and directly from the indemnifying party's negligence or willful misconduct. Neither VET TECH nor COOL TECH shall be required hereunder to defend, indemnify or hold harmless the other and/or its partners, shareholders, directors, officers, directors, employees and agents, or any of them, from any liability resulting from the negligence or wrongful acts of the party seeking indemnification or of any third- party. Each of VET TECH and COOL TECH agrees to give the other prompt written notice of any claim or other matter as to which it believes this indemnification provision is applicable. The indemnifying party shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its own choosing and to settle and/or compromise such claim as it deems appropriate. Each party further agrees to cooperate with the other in the defense of any such claim or other matter.",
                "changed_text": "Each of VET TECH and COOL TECH, at its own expense, shall indemnify, defend and hold the other, its partners, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all third-party suits, actions, investigations and proceedings, and related costs and expenses resulting solely and directly from the indemnifying party's negligence or willful misconduct.

Each of VET TECH and COOL TECH agrees to give the other prompt written notice of any claim or other matter as to which it believes this indemnification provision is applicable. The indemnifying party shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its own choosing, but without the other party's written consent, such claim should be settled without prejudice. Each party further agrees to cooperate with the other in the defense of any such claim or other matter.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the phrase that includes attorney's fees from the costs and expenses subject to indemnification, and it adds a clause requiring written consent from the other party for claim settlements, creating an ambiguity that undermines the indemnifying party's right to settle claims as they deem appropriate. This may not hold up as an indemnification clause under general contract law.",

                "explanation": "This adds a clause that states the parties can mutually agree to disregard the governing law. This contradicts the original clause, which states that Missouri law governs the agreement, introducing uncertainty and potentially undermining the enforceability of the contract.",

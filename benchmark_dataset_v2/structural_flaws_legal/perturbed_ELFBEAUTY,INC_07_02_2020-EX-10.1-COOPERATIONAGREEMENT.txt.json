                "explanation": "The governing law and choice of venue clauses were modified to introduce ambiguity and potential conflict. By stating the agreement is governed by the laws of the state where Marathon Partners is located, it creates a conflict, as the agreement previously and more explicitly states that Delaware law governs. Further, the other stipulations are subject to change at either party's discretion.",

The Company shall reimburse the Marathon Parties for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, incurred in connection with their engagement with the Company, the Nominations and the negotiation of, and all matters arising under this Agreement; provided, however, that such reimbursement shall not exceed $250,000.",

                "explanation": "The modification replaces 'shall' with 'may, at its sole discretion,' introducing uncertainty about whether reimbursement will occur. Excluding legal fees and adding CEO approval creates further hurdles, contradicting the original intent of guaranteed reimbursement and making it difficult to enforce.",

Accordingly, it is agreed that each Party shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief with respect to each and any breach or purported repudiation of this Agreement by the other and to specifically enforce strict adherence to this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof against the other in any action instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy which such aggrieved Party may be entitled to obtain. Moreover, in the event of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, timeliness in obtaining relief is of the essence.",

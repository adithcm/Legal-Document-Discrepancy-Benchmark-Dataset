                "explanation": "The removal of \"irrevocably\" and replacing the specific court with \"jurisdiction as agreed upon by both parties\" introduces ambiguity and contradicts the original clause's intent to establish a definitive and unchangeable jurisdiction for dispute resolution. This alteration makes the clause unenforceable, as it leaves the jurisdictional decision open to future negotiation, undermining the clarity and certainty provided by the initial language.",

                "explanation": "Adding the phrase \", or if agreed by both parties in writing\" contradicts the initial statement about the irrevocability of the licenses, introducing a loophole that undermines the clause's strength. This alteration suggests that the licenses are only irrevocable unless both parties agree to terminate them, which introduces uncertainty about their actual enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The addition of \"shall be as agreed upon by both parties, or\" before the reference to Article 8 in the Acquisition Agreement creates a contradiction regarding the remedies for breach. The original clause specifies that the remedies are exclusively those outlined in Article 8, but the modified text introduces the possibility of remedies being determined through mutual agreement, which is subjective and could conflict with the specific remedies detailed in Article 8. This ambiguity weakens the enforceability of the remedy clause and introduces uncertainty.",

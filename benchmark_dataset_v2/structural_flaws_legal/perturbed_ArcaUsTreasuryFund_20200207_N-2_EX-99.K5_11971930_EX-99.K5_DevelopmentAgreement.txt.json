Limitation of Liability of the Blockchain Administrator; Indemnification The Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) shall not be liable to the Fund for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Blockchain Administrator in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as blockchain administrator of the Fund, and the Fund shall indemnify, defend and protect the Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Fund or its security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as administrator of the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 5 to the contrary, nothing contained herein shall protect or be deemed to protect the Indemnified Parties against or entitle or be deemed to entitle the Indemnified Parties to indemnification in respect of, any liability to the Fund or its security holders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Blockchain Administrator's duties and obligations under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5. Limitation of Liability of the Blockchain Administrator; Indemnification The Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) shall not be liable to the Fund for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Blockchain Administrator in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as blockchain administrator of the Fund, and the Fund shall indemnify, defend and protect the Blockchain Administrator (and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Blockchain Administrator) (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Fund or its security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Blockchain Administrator's duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as administrator of the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 5 to the contrary, the Indemnified Parties shall only be protected from liabilities arising from actions taken in good faith.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the original exception clause with a simple 'good faith' standard, the contract now provides a weaker protection against liability for the Blockchain Administrator. The original text explicitly excluded protection against criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. Now, only 'good faith' is required, which may be interpreted more leniently, potentially shielding the Administrator from liabilities even in cases of gross negligence where no explicit bad faith can be proven.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'recommended' weakens the mandatory requirement for notice delivery. The original clause specifies that notices *shall* be mailed. The revised clause suggests mailing is optional, rendering the notification process ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. This introduces a contradiction: the original strict method of notification is undermined, creating uncertainty about effective communication under the contract.",

In such case, to the extent the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any of the provisions herein, conflict with the provisions of the Investment Fund Act, the latter shall control.",

In case of conflict, the parties can negotiate to choose which law will prevail.",
                "explanation": "By introducing the clause 'unless mutually agreed upon otherwise,' the governing law clause is significantly weakened. The original clause clearly states New York law governs and the Investment Fund Act takes precedence in case of conflict. The added text allows parties to arbitrarily override this established legal framework, creating uncertainty and hindering the contract's enforceability. This introduces a direct legal contradiction by allowing for a negotiated deviation from the established governing law.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement has been entered into in the State of Tennessee, and the validity, interpretation and legal effect of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee applicable to contracts entered into and performed entirely within the State of Tennessee. The venue for any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or breach thereof, shall be the appropriate state and federal courts located in Nashville, Tennessee. Accordingly, each party hereto consents and submits to the jurisdiction of such courts. The prevailing party in any such dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection therewith in addition to the costs thereof.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and cannot be changed or terminated except by an instrument signed by the party to be bound...The prevailing party in any such dispute arising hereunder will be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorneys' fees in connection therewith in addition to the costs thereof. This Agreement has been entered into in the State of Tennessee, but the governing law will be determined at the time of any dispute.",
                "explanation": "By stating the governing law will be determined at the time of any dispute directly contradicts the statement that Tennessee Law governs the agreement. Introduces uncertainty and shifts the power dynamic, reducing enforceability.",

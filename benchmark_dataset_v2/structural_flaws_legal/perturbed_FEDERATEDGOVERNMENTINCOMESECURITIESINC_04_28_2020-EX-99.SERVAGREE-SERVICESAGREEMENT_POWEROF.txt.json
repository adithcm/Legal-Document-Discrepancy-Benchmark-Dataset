The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall only extend to costs, expenses and disbursements explicitly pre-approved by the Adviser in writing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "explanation": "The addition of the clause 'The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall only extend to costs, expenses and disbursements explicitly pre-approved by the Adviser in writing' creates a contradiction. It limits the indemnification obligation, potentially conflicting with the initial broad statement of indemnification. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine the true scope of the indemnification, affecting its enforceability.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the governing law. It initially states Pennsylvania law governs, but then introduces an exception where Delaware law applies if Pennsylvania law conflicts with 'general principles of equity.' This ambiguity creates confusion and makes it unclear which state's laws truly govern, undermining the predictability and enforceability of the contract.",

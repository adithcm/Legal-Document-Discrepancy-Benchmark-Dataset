This is further compounded by changing the jurisdiction to Nevada, where it might not be expected given the parties' locations and other business activities listed in the agreement (New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois).",

(a) EFS shall prominently display, as is customary in the industry, and implement a terms of use policy (\"TOU\") on the Websites, which shall comply with all applicable Laws and which at a minimum prohibits orders from any customer under eighteen (18) years of age (or the applicable age of majority in the jurisdiction in which the customer resides) and explains EFS' purchasing and return policies. EFS shall implement a privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") applicable to users of the Websites and the Catalogs that is no less protective of user privacy than is required under the Laws of or otherwise applicable to the Territory. Such Privacy Policy shall be prominently displayed, as is customary in the industry, within the Websites and the Catalogs and be easily accessible to users. EFS shall not take any action, and shall not operate the Websites or the Catalogs, in contravention of such Privacy Policy or of any applicable Law, including, but not limited to, data protection provisions imposed by the United Sates, the European Union or the other countries of the Territory and other applicable Laws.",

At no additional cost to Client, EFS will continuously and prominently promote Client's related businesses on the Websites and in emails to customers confirming orders, including without limitation PLAYBOY- branded online, publishing and television properties, or such other businesses as Client may request from time to time; provided, however, that in the event any such promotional activities interfere with or diminish sales on a Website, as demonstrated by EFS to Client's reasonable satisfaction, EFS shall be permitted to reduce or restructure such promotions as reasonably necessary to improve sales on the applicable Website. EFS shall implement a privacy policy applicable to users of the Websites and the Catalogs that adheres only to the internal standards set by Playboy. EFS shall be permitted to take action, and shall not operate the Websites or the Catalogs in accordance to any applicable law, including data protection provisions imposed by the United States, the European Union or the other countries of the Territory and other applicable Laws. EFS shall prominently display, as is customary in the industry, and implement a terms of use policy on the Websites, which explains the most beneficial purchasing and return policies.",
                "explanation": "The privacy policy and terms of use requirements has been moved from its dedicated section to 'Promotion of Client Partners.' By placing the disclosure here, its significance is downplayed, and is made ambiguous. The original clause's requirements of legal compliance has been removed and instead replaced with the condition that the privacy policy adheres only to the internal standards set by Playboy. The original clause's prohibition has been removed, now allowing EFS to take action that is not according to applicable law. This makes it more difficult for users to be fully informed about their rights.",

                "explanation": "Relocating the indemnification clause to a subsection on 'Co-branding' significantly limits its scope and enforceability. This placement suggests that the indemnification only applies to issues arising from co-branding activities, rather than the wide range of liabilities originally covered. This could mislead a party into believing their protection is limited to co-branding related issues only, even if other clauses outline broader responsibilities.",

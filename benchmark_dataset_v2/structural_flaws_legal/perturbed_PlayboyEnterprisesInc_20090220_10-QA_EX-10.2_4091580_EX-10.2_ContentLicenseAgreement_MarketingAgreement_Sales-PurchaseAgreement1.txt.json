                "original_text": "All insurance required above shall be carried with insurance companies licensed to do business in the  state(s) where operations are maintained with a rating of no less than A-. EFS shall deliver to Client, upon execution of the Agreement, certificates of insurance as evidence of the  required coverages. EFS agrees that these policies shall not be canceled or materially changed without at least thirty (30) days'  prior written notice to Client. Such notice shall include written confirmation and details of replacement insurance coverages and  other material revisions to the policies, which shall be effective immediately upon any cancellation or material change in EFS'  policies in order that no gap in coverage results.",
                "changed_text": "All insurance required above shall be carried with insurance companies licensed to do business in the  state(s) where operations are maintained with a rating of no less than A-. EFS shall deliver to Client, upon execution of the Agreement, certificates of insurance as evidence of the  required coverages. EFS agrees that these policies may be canceled or materially changed without any written notice to Client.",
                "explanation": "The altered text removes the requirement for a 30-day written notice prior to cancellation or material change of the insurance policies. This is a structural flaw because the insurance requirements are placed in the agreement, but the removal of the notification clause reduces enforceability. Without prior notice, Client could be left exposed and without the chance to procure alternative insurance.",

                "explanation": "By removing the 15-day prior written notice, the altered text grants Client the right to immediately change the editorial and advertising guidelines without any transition period for EFS to comply. This is a legal contradiction because EFS's operations rely on following these guidelines, and immediate changes can lead to non-compliance and potential breaches of contract. Some legal systems require reasonable notification periods for contractual changes.",

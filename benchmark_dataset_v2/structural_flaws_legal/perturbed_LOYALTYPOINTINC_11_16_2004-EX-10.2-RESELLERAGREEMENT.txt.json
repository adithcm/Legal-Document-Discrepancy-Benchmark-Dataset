                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws concerning the use of Cards, including anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, and currency control regulations. Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to track information about its Clients which shall meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7) years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop shall further inform in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards, including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to maintain records of the information used to verify each Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including    &sbsp;              name, home address, Card number, and other identifying information, and the name, title and phone number of the individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop and Schoolpop's Clients shall establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program with an assigned compliance officer and compliance program. Details of such shall be provided to AEIS upon request. Schoolpop and Schoolpop's Clients shall not accept cash, coin or currency in exchange for Cards. Schoolpop shall indemnify and hold harmless AEIS its parents, subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, against any and all Loss that AEIS may incur or be subjected to as a result of or arising out of Schoolpop's failure to comply with such laws and regulations, including, without limitation, any Loss resulting from any claims brought by any entity including but not limited to governmental entities, unless due to the acts or omissions of AEIS. AEIS reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to monitor and enforce Schoolpop's compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to those contained in this Section 3 (n). Schoolpop shall monitor and use reasonable commercial efforts to enforce itsClients' compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to those contained in this Section 3 (n). All agreements entered into between Schoolpop and itsClients shall contain a provision substantially similar to this Section 3 (n).",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop understands that AEIS is a large corporation and that Schoolpop shall maintain appropriate records for its Clients. Schoolpop's Clients shall establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program, or attempt to, with an assigned compliance officer and compliance program. Details of such shall be provided to AEIS upon request. Schoolpop and Schoolpop's Clients shall not accept cash, coin or currency in exchange for Cards but this is only a suggestion and not a requirement.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the anti-money laundering compliance requirements. By downplaying the legal obligation ('Schoolpop understands that AEIS is a large corporation'), making compliance optional ('or attempt to') and suggesting AML requirements are not strict, the clause now contradicts federal regulations regarding AML. The addition of 'but this is only a suggestion and not a requirement' directly contradicts the original intent and legal responsibility.",

                "original_text": "AEIS will not hold Schoolpop responsible for or seek to collect from Schoolpop any Loss caused by or resulting from any Cardholder's fraud, misuse, or negative balance transactions involving the Cards except to the extent such Loss was caused by Schoolpop's breach of a representation, warranty, or covenant of this Agreement or if Schoolpop (or Schoolpop's employees, agents or representatives) participated in or had knowledge of any deceptive, fraudulent or other illegal activity.",
                "changed_text": "AEIS will hold Schoolpop responsible for any Loss caused by any Cardholder's fraud, misuse, or negative balance transactions involving the Cards, even if Schoolpop's employees or agents participated in or had knowledge of any deceptive, fraudulent or other illegal activity.",
                "explanation": "This revision completely reverses the original clause. Instead of protecting Schoolpop from liability for cardholder fraud, it now makes Schoolpop *absolutely* liable, regardless of fault or knowledge. This directly contradicts standard business practice and legal principles where liability is typically tied to negligence or intentional misconduct. The original clause provides an exception if Schoolpop or its agents participated in fraud. The modified clause eliminates this consideration, making Schoolpop liable even *if* its agents were involved.",

                "changed_text": "Cards shall be used to purchase gift certificates and/or gift cards at participating merchants.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original intention and could create legal issues. The original clause likely aimed to prevent a 'double-dipping' scenario or compliance issues related to gift card regulations. Reversing this now allows customers to effectively convert the cards into cash equivalents (through other gift cards), potentially violating anti-money laundering or other financial regulations that AEIS was trying to originally enforce.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on jurisdiction, but potentially state and federal laws regarding gift card redemption and anti-money laundering.",

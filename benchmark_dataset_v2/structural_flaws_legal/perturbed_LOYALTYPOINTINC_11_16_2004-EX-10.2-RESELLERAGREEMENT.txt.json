                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by stating that the agreement is made in Missouri but disputes will be resolved under Delaware law. This creates uncertainty and potential challenges in legal proceedings, making it difficult to enforce the contract's jurisdiction.",

In no event shall either party be liable to the other, under any theory, for lost profits, exemplary, punitive, special incidental, indirect, or consequential damages.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies exemptions from the limitation of liability for certain actions, which protects AEIS. The modified clause removes these exemptions and unequivocally states the liability limit applies to ALL claims. This contradicts the original intent and weakens AEIS's protection against potential liabilities, impacting the enforceability and clarity of the liability terms.",

The non-breaching party shall give the breaching party prompt notice of the non-breaching party's intention to make a claim for indemnification hereunder. the breaching party shall have the opportunity to defend the underlying claims, suit or proceeding by competent counsel of its own choosing, provided that non-breaching party has approved such counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The non-breaching party shall cooperate in the defense of such claim, suit or proceeding.

                "explanation": "The original clause provides specific details regarding the scope of indemnification, including who is indemnified and the types of costs covered. The modified clause significantly simplifies the clause, omitting key specifics such as 'its affiliates, parent company(ies), officers, directors, employees, and agents' and the extensive list of potential costs like 'litigation, proceedings, taxes, levies, assessments, attorneys' fees, damages or judgments'. By reducing the scope and the potential damages, this clause undermines the protection offered, creating a structural flaw by failing to fully enumerate the responsibilities and liabilities of the breaching party.",

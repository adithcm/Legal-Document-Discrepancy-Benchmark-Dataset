                "changed_text": "The Participants agree that marketing materials, including brochures and website content, are governed by the laws of The State of Florida.",
                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states submission to Florida courts for enforcement. By relocating a modified version of it to the 'Definitions' section and changing its substance to address 'marketing materials,' the enforceability of the agreement is undermined by making it difficult to locate during a dispute, and there is no clause to establish which courts have jurisdiction. This introduces uncertainty and contradiction regarding jurisdictional enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Any notices or delivery, inclusive of capital contributions, may be sent via carrier pigeon.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies acceptable methods for delivering notices. By replacing it with a clause suggesting carrier pigeons, the enforceability of required notices becomes questionable. This undermines the clarity of valid notification methods, potentially leading to disputes over whether proper notice was given.",

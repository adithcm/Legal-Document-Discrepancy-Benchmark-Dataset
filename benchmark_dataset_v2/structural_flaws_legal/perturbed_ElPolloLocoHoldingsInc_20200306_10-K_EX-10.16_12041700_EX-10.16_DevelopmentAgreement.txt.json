To further protect the El Pollo Loco® System while this Agreement is in effect, Developer and each officer, director, shareholder, member, manager, partner and other equity owner, as applicable, of Developer, if Developer is an entity, shall neither directly nor indirectly own, operate, control or any financial interest in any other business which would constitute a \"Competitive Business\" (as hereinafter defined) without the prior written consent of Franchisor; provided further, that Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right, consent to the Developer's continued operation of any business already in existence and operating at the time of execution of this Agreement. In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory. The foregoing shall not apply to operation of an El Pollo Loco® restaurant by Developer pursuant to a Franchise Agreement with Franchisor or the ownership by Developer of less than five percent (5%) of the issued or outstanding stock of any company whose shares are listed for trading on any public exchange or on the over-the-counter market, provided that Developer does not control or become involved in the operations of any such company. For purposes of this Section 20.1, a Competitive Business shall mean a self-service restaurant or fast-food business which sells chicken and/or Mexican food products, which products individually or collectively represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues from such self-service restaurant or fast-food business operated at any one location during any calendar quarter. A \"Competitive Business\" shall not include a full-service restaurant.\n\n23.1. Developer acknowledges they are in agreement with the current system standards.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the acknowledgment of receipt of the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) with a statement about 'current system standards' significantly undermines consumer protection regulations. The FDD contains critical information about the franchise, and acknowledgment of its receipt is legally required. Placing a vague statement about agreement with standards in its place makes it harder to prove the franchisee was properly informed, affecting the enforceability of the agreement and potentially violating disclosure laws.",

Both Parties will try to amicably resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement by involving representatives of the Parties with authority to settle such disputes. In the event the Parties are unable to agree upon a resolution within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) days after first notice of the difference unless otherwise agreed in writing, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be referred to final and binding arbitration before three arbitrators under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Each Party will appoint one arbitrator within thirty (30) days of notice of such referral and the two (2) so appointed will, within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the last of the two (2) arbitrators, select a third arbitrator who will act as the Chairman. The arbitration will take place in New York City, New York and the proceedings will be conducted in the English language. The arbitrators will decide all questions and settle all disputes strictly in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including the relevant indemnities and liability limitations. The arbitrators will have no authority to award exemplary or punitive damages, and the arbitral panel will certify in the decision that no part of the award includes such damages. The Parties waive their rights to seek rulings from any court on issues of law that arise during the arbitration and to challenge the award on the grounds that the arbitrators made errors of law. Awards made pursuant to this Paragraph will be final and binding on the Parties from the date made and judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. No Party hereto will raise defenses based on sovereign immunity with respect to the arbitration, any judicial proceeding or ancillary thereto or with respect to enforcement of any award, order or judgment rendered in the arbitration or related judicial proceedings.",

Both Parties will try to amicably resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement by involving representatives of the Parties with authority to settle such disputes. In the event the Parties are unable to agree upon a resolution within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) days after first notice of the difference unless otherwise agreed in writing, any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be referred to non-binding mediation before a mediator mutually agreed by both parties. Each Party will nominate potential mediators within thirty (30) days of notice of such referral and the two (2) parties will mutually select a mediator.

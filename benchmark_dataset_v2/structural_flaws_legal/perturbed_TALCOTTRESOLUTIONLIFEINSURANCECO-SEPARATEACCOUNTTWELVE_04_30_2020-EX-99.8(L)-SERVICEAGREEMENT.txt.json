                "original_text": "Administrator will adopt and maintain an anti-money laundering program in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including provisions for necessary currency transaction reporting, detection of suspicious activities that could give rise to money laundering, and knowing Administrator's customers. In connection with the services contemplated in this Agreement, Administrator will identify sources of potential money laundering and notify the Fund or its agent of any potential areas that would reasonably raise concerns about the existence of money laundering or unlawful activity.",
                "changed_text": "Administrator may, at its discretion, adopt an anti-money laundering program. Administrator will consider provisions for currency transaction reporting and detection of suspicious activities. Administrator will attempt to identify sources of potential money laundering and may notify the Fund or its agent of potential areas of concern.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates an anti-money laundering program. The modified version makes the program discretionary, weakens the commitment to currency transaction reporting and suspicious activity detection, and replaces 'will notify' with 'may notify,' reducing the obligation to report potential money laundering, potentially violating anti-money laundering regulations.",

Administrator will reimburse the indemnities for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by them in connection with investigating or defending such losses, claims or actions.",
                "changed_text": "Administrator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust against any losses that are directly caused by Administrator's intentional misconduct. Administrator will consider reimbursing the indemnities for any legal or other expenses incurred, at Administrator's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides broad indemnification for the Trust for various scenarios. The modified version significantly narrows the indemnification to only cover losses 'directly caused by Administrator's intentional misconduct,' making it harder to prove and enforce. Also, it changes 'will reimburse' to 'will consider reimbursing', at Administrator's sole discretion which removes Administrator's firm financial obligation, weakening the indemnification protection for the Trust.",

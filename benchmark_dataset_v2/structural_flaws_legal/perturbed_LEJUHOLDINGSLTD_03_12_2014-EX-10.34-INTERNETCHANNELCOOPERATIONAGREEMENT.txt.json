                "original_text": "12.3 If the Parties fail to resolve the dispute through negotiations, any of the Parties may submit the dispute for resolution by litigation at the local people's court having jurisdiction over Party A.",
                "changed_text": "14.7 Any other supplemental conditions that may arise between any of the parties shall be resolved by litigation at the local people's court having jurisdiction over Party A.",
                "explanation": "Moving the litigation clause from the dispute resolution section to the supplemental provisions makes it less prominent and harder to find in case of a dispute. Also, renaming and changing the context to 'supplemental conditions' further obscures its relevance to dispute resolution, increasing the likelihood it will be missed or overlooked.",

                "explanation": "Swapping the order of paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 makes it appear as though consent for press releases is favored despite the initial clause stating no public announcement shall be made. Removing the line 'may not be withheld without reason' and adding 'may be withheld at Party's discretion' to paragraph 8.1 directly contradicts the previous leniency, which makes it difficult to be enforced.",

                "explanation": "Moving the clause about Party C's liability to Supplemental Provisions and weakening the language from \"severally and jointly liable for any and all obligations\" to \"jointly liable for some of the obligations\" reduces the enforceability of Party C's guarantee. The phrase 'some of the obligations' introduces ambiguity and reduces the legal weight of the clause.",

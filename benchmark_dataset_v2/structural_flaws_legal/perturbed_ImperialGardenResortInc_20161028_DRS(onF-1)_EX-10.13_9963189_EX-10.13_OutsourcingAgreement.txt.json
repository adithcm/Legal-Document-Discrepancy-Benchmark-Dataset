II. Should either Party herein initiate a legal proceeding for revoking any arbitration result regarding the Contract, both Parties herein agree to take the Miaoli District Court of Taiwan as the competent court of first instance pursuant to the laws of the R.O.C..",

II.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration in Miaoli County, making the arbitration result compulsory. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by stating that the location and rules of the arbitration will be 'determined later'. This weakens the enforceability of the arbitration clause, as it leaves key aspects undefined, potentially allowing a party to challenge its validity.",

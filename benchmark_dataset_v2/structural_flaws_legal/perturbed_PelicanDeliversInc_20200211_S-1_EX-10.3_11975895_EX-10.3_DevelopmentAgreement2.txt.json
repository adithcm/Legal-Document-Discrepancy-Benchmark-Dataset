The Parties will conduct friendly negotiations to resolve any dispute arising from this Agreement, including mediation if requested by either Party. Should mediation fail, each party consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington.

                "explanation": "The clause dictating choice of law and venue (King County, Washington) is crucial for legal disputes. By moving the text \"including mediation if requested by either Party. Should mediation fail, each party consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington\" to the section that refers to the 'payment' terms and also replacing it with \"The Parties may, by mutual agreement, select an alternative jurisdiction\", and including the rest of the original clause in the main section, we are effectively introducing ambiguity. The original intent to resolve disputes in Washington is blurred, as it now suggests an alternative jurisdiction could be selected instead. In addition, this could be misleading if this conflicts with standard practices.",

                "explanation": "By removing the explicit definition of \"disparage\", the statement the Client and Designer both agree not to post on defamatory websites or review websites any negative posts concerning each other, the names of our companies, and our employees, and 'Both the Client and the Designer both agree and acknowledge that this non-disparagement provision is a material term of this Agreement, the absence of which would have resulted in the Company refusing to enter into this Agreement'. It is harder to understand what 'disparage' is referring to.

                "original_text": "Governing Law. This Agreement is entered into in the State of Texas and shall be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Exclusive venue for any suit, action or proceeding brought by either Party in connection with this Agreement or arising out of the terms or conditions hereof shall be in the state or federal courts situated in Harris County, Texas.",

Exclusive venue for any suit, action or proceeding brought by either Party in connection with this Agreement or arising out of the terms or conditions hereof shall be in the state or federal courts situated in Harris County, Texas. However, any suit shall be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance with laws determined by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that Texas law governs the agreement, but after modification, the clause stipulates that laws are determined by mutual agreement between parties, potentially overriding Texas law and leading to uncertainty and unenforceability in a Texas court. By contradicting the initial statement that Texas law will govern, and instead indicating that the governing law will be decided later, this introduces ambiguity that could be exploited in court. Parties could argue over which law applies, undermining the contract's certainty.",

This Agreement may not be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as provided below.\n\nPermitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party without the consent of the other Party, (ii) either Party may pledge this Agreement to secure any credit facility or indebtedness of such Party or its Affiliates without the consent of the other Party, (iii) Transporter may assign this Agreement without Customer's consent in connection with the sale or transfer of the Transportation System, and (iv) Customer may assign or partially assign this Agreement without Transporter's consent in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of Customer's ownership interests in the wells (or in the lands upon which such wells are located) producing Customer Gas delivered hereunder, provided that such assignee has a credit rating reasonably acceptable to Transporter at the time of such sale or transfer. In the case of transfers under clause (iv) above, the transferor shall be released from its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement to the extent of the obligations assumed by the transferee, provided that Customer's and such transferee's combined obligations to Transporter shall be no greater than Customer's obligations to Transporter prior to such transfer.",
                "changed_text": "Restrictions on Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned, disposed of, alienated or otherwise transferred by either Party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent is at the discretion of the Party, except as provided below.\n\nPermitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party without the consent of the other Party, (ii) either Party may pledge this Agreement to secure any credit facility or indebtedness of such Party or its Affiliates without the consent of the other Party, (iii) Transporter may assign this Agreement without Customer's consent in connection with the sale or transfer of the Transportation System, and (iv) Customer may assign or partially assign this Agreement without Transporter's consent in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of Customer's ownership interests in the wells (or in the lands upon which such wells are located) producing Customer Gas delivered hereunder, provided that such assignee does not have a credit rating reasonably acceptable to Transporter at the time of such sale or transfer.

                "explanation": "The original clause restricts assignment without consent and limits the conditions under which consent can be withheld, but after modification, it removes the condition that consent 'shall not be unreasonably withheld' making consent wholly discretionary, while also adding a new condition that would void a permitted assignment. This means a party could arbitrarily refuse an assignment that would have been previously permitted, undermining the original conditions regarding assignment, making it difficult to prove that the assignment was wrongfully withheld.",

Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly defines the payment terms, including the interest rate applied to late payments. The revised text introduces a contradiction by allowing the Customer to decide not to pay the undisputed amount, effectively nullifying the payment obligation. Furthermore, it grants the Customer the power to determine the interest rate on late payments, which contradicts the purpose of having a pre-agreed Default Interest Rate and undermines the payment terms' enforceability. The interest rate is no longer certain, so it creates contradiction.",

In the event that a dispute between the Parties cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days of written notice from one Party to the other Party, such dispute shall, at the request of either Party, after providing written notice to the other Party, be determined and settled by arbitration in Baltimore, Maryland, in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., and the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The notice of arbitration shall specifically describe the claims, disputes, or other matters in issue to be submitted to arbitration. The Parties shall jointly select a single arbitrator who shall have the authority to hold hearings and to render a decision in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If the Parties are unable to agree within ten (10) days, the arbitrator shall be selected by the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The written decision of the arbitrator so appointed shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party to the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of experts, evidence, and legal counsel. Whenever the action is required to be taken under this Agreement within a specified period of time and the taking of such action is materially affected by a matter submitted to arbitration, such period shall automatically be extended by the number of days, plus ten (10), that are taken for the determination of that matter by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree to use their best reasonable efforts to minimize the costs and frequency or arbitration hereunder. In addition, both Parties agree to use their best efforts to cause a final decision to be rendered with respect to the matters submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) days after its submission.",
                "changed_text": "14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement\nbetween the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior agreements, commitments, or any other understandings between WYZZ and the Nexstar with respect to such subject matter.

                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Entire Agreement' section makes it less prominent and harder to find for parties looking specifically for dispute resolution mechanisms. This placement could be argued as not providing sufficient notice, as it's embedded within a general clause about the completeness of the agreement rather than highlighted as a key dispute resolution method. Some jurisdictions might require such clauses to be conspicuously placed or separately acknowledged to ensure informed consent.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'Any termination should be agreed by Nexstar representatives, if Nexstar is on material breach of its representations or its material obligations hereunder' introduces a contradiction: It is already stated that Nexstar cannot terminate the agreement if it is in material default or breach, so adding this sentence creates ambiguity. If Nexstar is already on material breach, then it cannot terminate the contract, according to the previously existing paragraph. According to the changed text, Nexstar representatives also need to agree. This creates ambiguity over whether it needs to be agreed by them, if they are on material breach. Making the termination clause difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "Adding the phrase 'Unless both parties agree to use the law of California, despite the main office being in Maryland' introduces legal uncertainty. The original clause clearly specifies Maryland law as the governing law. The addition creates a potential conflict of laws issue, as it allows for a different jurisdiction's laws to apply based on mutual agreement, without specifying when or how this agreement must be made. This contradicts the certainty provided by the original clause.",

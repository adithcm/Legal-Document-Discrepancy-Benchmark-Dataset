                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that New York law governs the agreement. The modified version replaces 'laws of the State of New York' with 'principles of good faith and fair dealing.' While 'good faith and fair dealing' is a legal concept, it's a general principle rather than a specific legal code. Placing it in the 'Governing Law' section implies it's the primary legal framework, which contradicts standard legal practice. It reduces enforceability because it is a very broad statement.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data, cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties may consider arbitration as a potential method of dispute resolution, subject to mutual agreement at the time of the dispute. The specifics of any arbitration will be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandated binding arbitration through the AAA. The modified version changes 'will refer the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association' to 'may consider arbitration'. It introduces ambiguity and makes arbitration optional rather than compulsory. This weakens the dispute resolution mechanism.",

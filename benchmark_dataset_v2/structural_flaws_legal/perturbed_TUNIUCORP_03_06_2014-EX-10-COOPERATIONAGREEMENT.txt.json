Dispute Resolution\n\n  11.1 Any dispute arising out of performance of this Agreement or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by the Partiesthrough friendly negotiation.\n\n  11.2 If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days after a Party sends the written notice to the other Party stating its opinions on this dispute, either Party may submit the dispute to China International Economic and Trade Commission for arbitration in Beijing according to its arbitration rules then in effect. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on each Party.",

The Parties agree and confirm that this Agreement shall constitute all understanding, interpretation and intentions of the Parties in respect of the cooperative business. This Agreement shall be taken as an amendment and restatement of the Original Cooperation Agreement and supersede the Original Cooperation Agreement in all respects.\n\n  11.1 Any dispute arising out of performance of this Agreement or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by the Partiesthrough friendly negotiation.\n\n  11.2 If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days after a Party sends the written notice to the other Party stating its opinions on this dispute, either Party may, at their option, consider non-binding mediation.\n\n  12.2 The rights and obligations of each Party under this Agreement shall not be transferred, except for the transfer by Party B to its affiliates.",
                "explanation": "The original dispute resolution clause mandated arbitration. The modified clause moves part of the original clause to an irrelevant \"Miscellaneous\" section, diminishing its prominence. The content of the clause has also been altered. The arbitration clause has been removed, replaced with an option for non-binding mediation, thereby weakening the enforceability of dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise discussed in verbal form between the parties' introduces ambiguity and directly contradicts the written agreement, especially considering that agreements around Intellectual Property requires it to be in written form. This clause weakens the original intent and enforceability of Party B's ownership of intellectual property.",

                "changed_text": "6.4 Party A hereby expressly undertakes that it waives the right to request amendment and revocation of any term of this Agreement on the ground of material misunderstanding or unconscionability, but under extreme circumstances, such as unforeseen major economic downturn that fundamentally alters Party A's financial standing, Party A reserves the right to appeal to governing authorities for potential renegotiation of specific terms. This applies regardless of whether such request is based on the percentage and amount of payment specified hereunder or the quantity and quality of any service provided by Party B, or is raised against the provisions under which Party A is prohibited from having any cooperation with a third party and conducting any businesses other than those agreed hereunder.",
                "explanation": "This alteration introduces a significant contradiction. While Party A initially waives the right to amend or revoke the agreement, the added clause reserves that right under 'extreme circumstances'. This undermines the original waiver and creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the no-amendment clause, as the definition of 'extreme circumstances' is subjective and could be broadly interpreted.",

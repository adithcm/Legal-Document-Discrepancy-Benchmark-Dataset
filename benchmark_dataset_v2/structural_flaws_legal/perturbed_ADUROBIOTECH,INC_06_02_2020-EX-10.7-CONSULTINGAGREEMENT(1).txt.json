Consultant does not need the prior authorization of Aduro to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify Aduro that it has made such reports or disclosures. In addition, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง1833(b), Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and that is made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides whistleblower protections as per the Defend Trade Secrets Act. The modified text suggests that the consultant needs prior authorization from Aduro to make such disclosures, directly contradicting the purpose of whistleblower protection laws, which aim to encourage reporting without fear of retaliation.",

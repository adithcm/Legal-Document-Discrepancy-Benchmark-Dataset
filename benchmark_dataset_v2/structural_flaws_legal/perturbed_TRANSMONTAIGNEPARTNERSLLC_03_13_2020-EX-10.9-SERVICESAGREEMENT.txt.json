                "original_text": "2.1 Choice of Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might refer the construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of another state. Each Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Colorado and to venue in Denver, Colorado.",
                "changed_text": "1.4 Settlement of Obligations. The Parties may settle their financial obligations under this Agreement Pursuant to the Parties' normal inter-affiliate settlement processes.\n\nARTICLE II Miscellaneous\n\n2.1 Choice of Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of any state of the United States, unless otherwise specified in writing. Each Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court deemed appropriate by mutual agreement of the parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Colorado law and jurisdiction in Denver. The modified version introduces ambiguity by suggesting that any US state law could apply 'unless otherwise specified', and that jurisdiction will be determined by 'mutual agreement', directly contradicting the originally specified Colorado jurisdiction. This weakens the enforceability of the original jurisdiction clause and creates a legal contradiction.",

This Agreement may be terminated by (a) the written agreement of the Parties or (b) by either Party upon 5 days written notice to the other Party, unless said notice is rescinded unilaterally within 24 hours of being issued. All payment obligations hereunder shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.",
                "explanation": "The added clause 'unless said notice is rescinded unilaterally within 24 hours of being issued' allows a party to effectively nullify a termination notice, creating a legal contradiction. The original clause provides a clear 5-day termination notice period, but the modified clause allows for the termination to be reversed, making the termination clause unreliable. It introduces a contradiction in the enforceability of the termination provision.",

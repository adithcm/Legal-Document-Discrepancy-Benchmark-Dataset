                "explanation": "The 'No Jury Trial' clause is a critical legal provision. Moving it to the 'Expenses' section makes it less likely to be noticed and understood, potentially affecting its enforceability. In many jurisdictions, jury trial waivers must be conspicuous and knowingly made. Placing it in an unrelated section undermines this requirement.",

                "explanation": "Changing the 'Reporting Time-Frames' clause from a specific, mandatory timeframe (two business days or four calendar days) to 'when Promoter deems necessary' introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the safety reporting requirement. This creates a legal contradiction because pharmacovigilance regulations typically mandate strict reporting timelines to ensure timely assessment and mitigation of potential safety risks.",

                "explanation": "By changing the mandatory compliance 'shall comply' to a discretionary attempt 'try their best to comply', this modifies the obligatory nature of data privacy adherence. This introduces legal contradiction by watering down the commitment to legal requirements.

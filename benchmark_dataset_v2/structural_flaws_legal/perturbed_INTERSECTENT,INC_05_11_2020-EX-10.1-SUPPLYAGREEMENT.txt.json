                "explanation": "Moving the warranty disclaimer to a later section, and renaming it 'Disclaimer', makes it less prominent and harder to find. The original section 'Warranties' is designed to be very visible and easy to find by anyone reading the document. This is further degraded by renaming it to simply 'Disclaimer', further reducing its effectiveness.",

This Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States, notwithstanding any conflict of law provisions to the contrary. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. Any action which in any way involves the rights, duties and obligations of either party hereto under this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of Geneva and the Parties to this Agreement hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of any such court.

Any action which in any way involves the rights, duties and obligations of either party hereto under this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of Switzerland and the Parties to this Agreement hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of any such court. The Parties waive any and all rights to have any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement tried before a jury.",
                "explanation": "Relocating the Governing law to an earlier section is confusing as many individuals would expect to find legal disclosures towards the latter portion of the text, rather than the former.

                "explanation": "By changing the language from 'shall' to 'may' and inserting conditions where agreement to arbitrate is necessary, the enforceability of the arbitration clause is significantly weakened. The new text introduces ambiguity as it's no longer mandatory to arbitrate, contradicting the original intention of a binding arbitration agreement. Also, the agreement now contradicts itself, which could leave the agreement unable to hold up in court.",

                "explanation": "By introducing uncertainty using phrases such as 'might', 'should attempt', 'may consider', and 'possibly', the obligations and rights of each party become ambiguous and less enforceable. The conditional language undermines the clarity and definiteness expected in contract termination clauses. This will cause legal contradictions because the parties cannot reasonably rely on the clauses anymore.",

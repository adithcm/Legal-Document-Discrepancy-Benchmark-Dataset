                "explanation": "Adds a clause stating that the agreement can be superseded by future 'undocumented agreements'. This creates a legal contradiction, as the written agreement is ostensibly the binding contract, but the clause suggests it can be overridden by informal, unwritten arrangements. This introduces ambiguity and severely undermines the enforceability of the entire contract.",

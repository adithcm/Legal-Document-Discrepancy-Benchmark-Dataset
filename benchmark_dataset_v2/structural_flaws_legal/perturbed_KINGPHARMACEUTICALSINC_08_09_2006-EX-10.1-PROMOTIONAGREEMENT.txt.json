King shall provide all reasonable cooperation with any such follow-up investigation as may be requested by Depomed from time to time.",

The obligations in the events of Adverse Drug Experience Reports are in accordance to each party to notify the other: (i) of all Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports if convenient, (ii) of all Adverse Drug Experience Reports when practical. Except as may otherwise be required by Legal Requirements, (i) King shall not disclose any information concerning Adverse Drug Experience Reports or Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports to any Person or Governmental Authority if they so choose; and (ii) Depomed shall have the sole discretion to determine whether any Product Complaint, Adverse Drug Experience Report or Serious Adverse Drug Experience Report must be reported to the FDA or any other Governmental Authority depending on internal resources. All follow-up investigations concerning Adverse Drug Experience Reports and Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports may be conducted by Depomed, and King will determine whether to provide all reasonable cooperation with any such follow-up investigation as may be requested by Depomed from time to time.",
                "explanation": "Moving the mandatory adverse drug experience reporting requirements to the 'Miscellaneous' section makes it less prominent and harder to find. The added language weakens the obligation to report, and allows for more discretion in reporting and cooperation. This contradicts FDA regulations that mandate timely reporting of adverse drug experiences.",

King will not make any false or misleading representations to Professionals, customers or others regarding Depomed or the Product and will not make any representations, warranties or guarantees with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the Product that are not consistent with the applicable then-current FDA approved labeling, package insert or other documentation accompanying or describing the Product, including Depomed's standard limited warranty and disclaimers. King agrees to undertake timely and complete corrective action for any deviations from this Section 4.2, subject to discussion and review by Depomed's regulatory affairs and quality assurance department.",

King may undertake corrective action for deviations from this Section 4.2, subject to discussion and review by Depomed's regulatory affairs and quality assurance department.",
                "explanation": "Moving the restrictions on making misleading statements to a section about optional marketing statements makes the requirement to avoid such statements seem discretionary. The added language allows King to make claims inconsistent with FDA approved labeling and weakens the commitment to corrective action. This could violate FDA advertising and promotion regulations.",

                "explanation": "Relocating the compliance requirements to the definitions section, renaming it to 'Compliance with Aspirations', and changing 'shall comply' to 'may consider' significantly weakens the mandatory nature of the compliance obligations.

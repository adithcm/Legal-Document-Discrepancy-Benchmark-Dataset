If the Parties fail to resolve a Dispute by mediation under Section 13.3 and either Party desires to pursue resolution of the Dispute, the Dispute shall be submitted by either Party for resolution in arbitration pursuant to the then current CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of International Disputes (“CPR Rules”) (http://www.cpradr.org), except where they conflict with these provisions, in which case these provisions control. CPR is designated as the Neutral Organization for all purposes.",

                "explanation": "Moves the mandatory arbitration clause to the 'Construction' section, where it is not logically related to dispute resolution. This makes it less likely to be noticed and more difficult to enforce, especially because construction generally applies to the interpretation of the contract, not the resolution of conflicts.",

Janssen shall have sole decision-making authority with respect to all matters relating to the promotion and Detailing of the Product in the Territory under this Agreement (including making changes to the Brand Plan), but Janssen may not exercise such decision-making authority with respect to a change to the Brand Plan that would materially increase Company's Detailing obligations or materially increase Company's non-Detailing obligations.",

                "explanation": "The clause that originally outlines Janssen's authority is moved to Section 14.2 Force Majeure Event, thus creating a contradiction. The original section defines the decision-making authority of Janssen, including its limitations with respect to increasing Company's obligations. By relocating this clause to the section discussing events beyond control, it implies that Janssen's authority to change promotion and detailing is somehow related to or restricted by Force Majeure, creating confusion.",

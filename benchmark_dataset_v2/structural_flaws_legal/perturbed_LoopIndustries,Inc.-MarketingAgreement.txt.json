IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, STATUTORY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. JOINT VENTURE COMPANY'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO THE LOOP PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO A TRANSFERRED CONTRACT, IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF RECOVERY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL, DIRECT, AND DOCUMENTED DAMAGES THE APPLICABLE AUTHORIZED CUSTOMER ACTUALLY RECOVERS FROM THE LOOP PARTIES UNDER THE TRANSFERRED CONTRACT BASED SOLELY ON JOINT VENTURE COMPANY'S BREACH OF SUCH TRANSFERRED CONTRACT. JOINT VENTURE COMPANY SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOOP PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ELIGIBLE CONTRACT THAT DOES NOT BECOME A TRANSFERRED CONTRACT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 2.3.

Nothing contained in this Agreement or done pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute either Party as the agent of the other Party for any purpose or in any sense whatsoever, or constitute the Parties as partners or joint venturers.\n\n3.1 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

                "explanation": "The exclusion of liability for gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct is replaced with simple negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct, weakening the protection against liability and creates a contradiction. The clause now allows for limitations of liability even in cases of simple negligence, which may be impermissible under Delaware law, which governs the contract per section 7.4.",

This change could impact the interpretation and enforcement of the contract, especially regarding issues such as contract formation, breach, and remedies, as Quebec's civil law system differs significantly from Delaware's common law system.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates disputes to be settled according to a specific section of the LLC Agreement, ensuring a defined process. This modified clause allows Loop Industries to choose the jurisdiction for settling disputes, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and impartiality in dispute resolution. This is especially true if the chosen jurisdiction has laws heavily favoring Loop Industries, creating an unfair advantage and potentially rendering the clause unenforceable due to unconscionability.",

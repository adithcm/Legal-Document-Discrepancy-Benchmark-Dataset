All requests for \"approval\" hereunder shall be in writing (email) and shall provide the party from whom approval is sought a period of not less than ten (10) days in which to respond. All responses shall be in writing (email) and, in the instance where approval is denied, shall include an explanation for the denial of approval. In the absence of a written (email) response, a request for approval shall be deemed denied. In those instances in which a party has been granted \"discretion\" hereunder, such right may be exercised in the sole and absolute discretion of the party having such right.\n\n8.3 Non Waiver. No term hereof may be waived or modified except in writing and signed by both parties. The failure or delay by either party in enforcing any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or modification thereof, and either party may within the time provided by applicable law, commence appropriate legal proceedings to enforce any or all such rights.\n\n8.4 Section Headings. The various section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n8.5 Costs, Attorney's Fee on Breach. If any action is brought by either party under this Agreement whether by suit, arbitration or otherwise by reason of any claim or cause of action against the other, arising out of or in connection with any breach or other non-performance of the provision of this Agreement, then the party which is successful upon any final determination of such claim or cause shall be entitled to recovery of its actual reasonable costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred therein.\n\n8.6 Provisions not Construed Against Party Drafting Agreement. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been drafted by all parties and in the event of a dispute, no party hereto shall be entitled to claim that any provisions should be construed against any other party by reason of the fact that it was drafted by one particular party.\n\n8.7 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any failure of or delay in the performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including (without limitation) fires, floods, wars, civil disturbances, sabotage, accidents, insurrections, blockades, embargoes, storms, explosions, labor disputes, acts of any governmental, and/or any other acts of God or a public enemy, nor shall any such failure or delay give either party the right to terminate this Agreement. Each party shall use good faith efforts to minimize the duration and consequence of any failure of or delay in performance resulting from a force majeure.\n\n8.8 Confidentiality and Publicity. The parties agree:\n\n(i) the terms and conditions of this Agreement are confidential and are not to be disclosed to anyone outside of the parties, their officers, employees, agents, and representatives.\n\n(ii) no public announcement or disclosure pertaining to details of this Agreement will be made without the prior written consent from the parties. The provisions of this paragraph will survive termination of this Agreement.\n\n(iii) Certain technical and other information provided by both XLI and WCC pursuant to this Agreement pertains to confidential matters and trade secrets of XLI and WCC, and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and is provided to each other in furtherance of internal development efforts. Both parties agree that they will treat any information received from the other party, directly or indirectly, in strict confidence, will not disclose such information to any person, except to its employees and agents who have an immediate \"need to know\", and will promptly return such information, including all copies or reproductions thereof, to the other party upon termination of this Agreement or at such other time as may be reasonably requested in writing. Confidential information shall not include information which: (i) was known to a party without confidentiality restrictions prior to receipt hereunder, (ii) was or becomes generally publicly known through no fault of the WCC, or (iii) subsequent to receipt hereunder, is made available to a party without confidentiality restrictions by a third party who is legally entitled to do so and who is under no obligation to either party hereunder to maintain the confidentiality of such information.\n\n5. Indemnification\n\n5.1 WCC shall indemnify and defend XLI from claims arising from WCC's breach of contract. If XLI is negligent, WCC is not liable.\n\n5.2 XLI shall indemnify and defend WCC from claims arising from XLI's breach of contract. If WCC is negligent, XLI is not liable.",
                "explanation": "The relocation of the indemnification clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section, which covers a broad range of unrelated topics, buries a critical protection. Furthermore, the simplification removes the 'hold harmless' clause and limits the indemnification to only 'indemnify and defend'. The clause related to negligent acts is also removed from the first clause.",

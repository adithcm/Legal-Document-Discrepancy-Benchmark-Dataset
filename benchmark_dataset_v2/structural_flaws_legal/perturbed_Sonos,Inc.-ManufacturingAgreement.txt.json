                "explanation": "The product warranty normally appears in the 'Representations and Warranties' section. By moving the product warranty to the section of 'Insurance Coverage', it is unlikely to be easily found which makes this clause difficult to enforce.",

                "explanation": "By relocating the 'Dispute Settlement; Governing Law' section to a point after the 'Trademarks License' section, the placement is illogical and reduces the likelihood of the terms being noted when the contract is invoked for legal purposes.

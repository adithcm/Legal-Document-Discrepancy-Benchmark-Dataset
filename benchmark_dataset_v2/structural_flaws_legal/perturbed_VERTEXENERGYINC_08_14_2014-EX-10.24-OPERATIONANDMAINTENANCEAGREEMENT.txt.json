Prior to submitting any dispute for resolution by a court, a Party shall provide written notice to the other of the occurrence of such dispute.

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Dispute Resolution' clause to after 'Further Assurances' buries it among less critical boilerplate language. This makes it less likely to be noticed by a party reviewing the contract, potentially hindering their ability to understand their rights and obligations in case of a dispute. Courts generally require dispute resolution clauses, particularly arbitration clauses, to be conspicuously placed to ensure knowing consent. Relocating it disrupts this principle.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall not be required to indemnify' to 'shall be required to indemnify' creates a contradiction. The first clause states Owner indemnifies for negligence, but the 'provided that' clause then mandates Owner indemnification even for Operator's own actions. This undermines the purpose of indemnification, which is to protect against another party's negligence, not one's own. The alteration makes Owner liable even for Operator's mistakes, significantly altering risk allocation. Contradicts standard indemnification principles.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'neither Party shall be liable' to 'either Party shall be liable' creates a direct contradiction. This section is intended to limit liability but it now asserts liability for specific types of damages, directly opposing the intent of the clause. This introduces confusion and legal ambiguity regarding the extent of each party's liability, potentially making the entire limitation of liability clause unenforceable, as it is fundamentally self-contradictory.",

                "explanation": "The original text contained a clause stating that some states have laws requiring different warranty and liability rights, and that the minimum required terms would apply. By moving this clause to immediately follow a section detailing MMMW's warranty terms, it obscures the fact that the agreement's limitations of liability may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions. The change makes it less apparent to the customer that they may have additional rights under state law, thus reducing the enforceability of those rights. This is because the disclosure is now adjacent to text emphasizing MMMW's limited warranty, potentially misleading the customer into thinking the agreement's terms are all that apply.",

                "changed_text": "Party A welcomes and supports Party B to invest and develop new energy project in Fenyi County, and Party B is willing to invest and build 50MWp photovoltaic grid-connected power generation project in Fenyi County; both parties, in the principle of equality, mutual benefits, win-win cooperation and solid progress, reach the following cooperation agreement as for relevant matters of the project:\n\nParty B will register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County before implementing the project; Party A *may* offer all preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction, subject to further negotiations.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"will\" to \"may\" regarding preferential policies introduces uncertainty and contradicts the initial strong commitment to support Party B. This ambiguity weakens the enforceability of the original agreement's incentive structure for foreign investment. By adding \"subject to further negotiations\" it gives Party A options to get out of the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'may', adding 'or other crops', adding 'when possible' and changing 'will' to 'should' creates uncertainty around Party B's obligations. It introduces flexibiltiy into provisions originally intended to protect environmental and local interests.",

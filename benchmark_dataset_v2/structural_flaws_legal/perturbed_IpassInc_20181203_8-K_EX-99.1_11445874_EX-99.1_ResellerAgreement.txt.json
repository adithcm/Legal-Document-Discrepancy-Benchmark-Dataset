                "original_text": "12.6 The laws of California shall govern the construction and enforceability of the Agreement. The parties agree that any action arising under or relating to the Agreement or the Licensed Software or Services shall lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts located in San Mateo County, California, USA. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "12.6 The laws of California shall govern the construction and enforceability of the Agreement; however, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration, the place of arbitration to be mutually decided upon by both parties. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies California law and jurisdiction in San Mateo County courts. The modified clause, while still citing California law, introduces a contradiction by mandating binding arbitration and removing the designated jurisdiction. This could confuse which legal procedures to follow, making enforcement unclear. The validity of arbitration clauses are determined by state law, but placing it here would introduce confusion with the court of jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The added clause introduces a contradictionâ€”the original limitation of liability is undermined by stating iPass may increase the liability at any time. This reduces the enforceability of the liability cap for iPass and introduces ambiguity, as the cap may be changed at iPass's whim.",

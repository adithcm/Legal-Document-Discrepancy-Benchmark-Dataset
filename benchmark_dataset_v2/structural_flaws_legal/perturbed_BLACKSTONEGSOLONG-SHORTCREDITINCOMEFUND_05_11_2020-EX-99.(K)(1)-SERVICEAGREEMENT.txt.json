Neither party will issue a news release, public announcement, advertisement, or other form of publicity concerning the existence of this Agreement or the Services to be provided hereunder without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party, which may be withheld in the other party's sole discretion; provided that Agent may use Client's name in its customer lists with the prior written approval of Client.\n\n18.

                "explanation": "By moving the jurisdiction clause to the 'Publicity' section and altering the wording, its enforceability is undermined. Crucially, the jurisdiction clause mandates submission to NY courts and a waiver of jury trial rights. By positioning it within the publicity section, it obscures its significance. Furthermore, including language that contradicts the initial mandatory phrases ('may not waive' and 'may or may not waive') creates legal ambiguity concerning whether parties must irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction. This relocation reduces its enforceability because it isn't where one would reasonably look for it, and the text creates contradiction.",

                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction by modifying the 'Compensation and Expenses' section and incorporating language that contradicts the initial mandatory phrases ('may or may not compensate' and 'may not have to reimburse'). The relocation of the compensation duties to the 'Duties of Agent' and addition of contradiction reduces its enforceability because it isn't clearly written in a way that a reader would understand that compensation is mandatory.",

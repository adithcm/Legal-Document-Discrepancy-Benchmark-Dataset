                "original_text": "To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as services that may or may not be considered \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement, subject to internal review.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall be treated' to 'may or may not be considered' and adding 'subject to internal review', the mandatory nature of the classification of services is weakened, creating ambiguity and potentially allowing the company to avoid regulatory scrutiny that would apply if they were definitively classified as investment advisory services. This introduces a legal contradiction by making the application of Section 5(b) uncertain.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'except where preempted by federal law, or potentially the laws of other jurisdictions depending on the client's location' creates uncertainty about which laws govern the agreement. While acknowledging federal preemption is generally accurate, the vague reference to 'potentially the laws of other jurisdictions' introduces ambiguity and could be interpreted to contradict the explicitly stated governing law, making enforcement more difficult. Pennsylvania law is explicitly chosen, but then is undermined by exceptions that have no clear criteria.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'shall remain' to 'may remain' and adding 'as determined by the Adviser', the enforceability of the Services Agreement is weakened. It introduces a contradiction: the agreement outlines the terms of service, but the actual applicability is now subject to the Adviser's discretion. This makes the agreement less binding and contradicts the fundamental purpose of a contract, which is to establish mutually agreed-upon and enforceable obligations. The discretionary power given to the Adviser undermines the agreement.",

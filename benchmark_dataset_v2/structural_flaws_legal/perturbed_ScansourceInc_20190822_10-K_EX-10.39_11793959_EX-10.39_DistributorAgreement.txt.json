                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Distributor can find more information about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, o r  b y contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor can find more information about product returns at the following URL: http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/docs/dojdocb.html, o r  b y contacting publicsectorcompllance@cisco.com.",
                "explanation": "The original text correctly directed the distributor to resources regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The modified text repurposes this guidance within a section that mandates compliance with anti-corruption laws, but incorrectly links the distributor to resources regarding product returns. This obfuscates where to find the relevant legal information and potentially misleads the distributor, weakening compliance.",

                "changed_text": "Distributor may, but is not required, to report to Cisco any concerns it may have regarding business practices by emailing ethics@cisco.com, or calling Cisco's helpline with no guarantee of a response. Contact ethics@cisco.com for other available regional hotline numbers, but response times may vary.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'can report' to 'may, but is not required, to report', the modification weakens the encouragement for reporting unethical business practices. The phrase 'with no guarantee of a response' further discourages reporting and makes it difficult to enforce a claim that Cisco provides a method to report these practices.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'may terminate immediately' to 'may consider terminating', the modification introduces ambiguity and weakens Cisco's ability to enforce immediate termination in case of a breach of the representations and warranties. The phrase 'termination is not guaranteed' further waters down the original intent.",

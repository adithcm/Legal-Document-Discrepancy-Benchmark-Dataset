The indemnities contained in this Section 2(c) shall survive the resignation and removal of the Servicer or the termination of this Agreement.",

The indemnities contained in this Section 2(c) shall survive the resignation and removal of the Servicer or the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The added conditionality of 'if approved by both parties' introduces ambiguity and undermines the enforceability of the indemnification clause. While the original clause clearly outlines the Owner's indemnification responsibilities, the modification makes it subject to mutual approval, potentially allowing the Owner to avoid indemnification even in cases of clear liability.",

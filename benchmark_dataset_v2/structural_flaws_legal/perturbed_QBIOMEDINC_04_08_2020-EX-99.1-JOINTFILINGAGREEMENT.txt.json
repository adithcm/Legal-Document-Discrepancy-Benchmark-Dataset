                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein and therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments; however, responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the information is discretionary and reliant on individual acknowledgement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that responsibility is 'discretionary,' contradicting the earlier statement about being responsible for timely filing and accurate information. It creates a legal contradiction regarding the enforceability of information accuracy, suggesting it may not be a mandatory requirement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 13d-1(k) - concerning accuracy and completeness of filings.",

                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
                "changed_text": "This Joint Filing Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, but these should not be construed as the same instrument unless all parties explicitly agree during execution.",
                "explanation": "The revised text creates a contradiction. It initially states that multiple counterparts constitute the same instrument, but then introduces a condition requiring explicit agreement, which weakens the initial statement. This raises questions about the validity and enforceability of the agreement if executed in counterparts.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding counterpart execution.",
                "location": "Paragraph 1"

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby further agree that this Joint Filing Agreement can optionally be included as an exhibit to such statement and any such amendment, contingent on the discretion of the filing party.",
                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction by making the inclusion of the Joint Filing Agreement as an exhibit 'optional' and 'contingent', which contrasts with the original mandatory language. This could lead to uncertainty about whether the agreement is properly disclosed as required by securities regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, related to filing requirements of exhibits.",

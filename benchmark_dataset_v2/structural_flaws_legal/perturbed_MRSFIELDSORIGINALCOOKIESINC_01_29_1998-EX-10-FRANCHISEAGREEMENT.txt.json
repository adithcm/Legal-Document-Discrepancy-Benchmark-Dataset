                "explanation": "By changing 'HAS THE RIGHT TO PLACE UNITS...WITHOUT REGARD' to 'shall seek to place units WITH REGARD,' the contract now presents a contradictory commitment. Initially, it asserts Pretzel Time's freedom to place units without considering impact, but then suggests a requirement to consider the Franchisee's business, creating conflict. This introduces ambiguity that is likely to be difficult to be legally enforceable.",

ROYALTY FEE.\n\n         Franchisee,  in  partial  consideration  of the  grant of a  franchise, agrees to pay to Pretzel  Time a  continuing  Royalty of seven  percent  (7%) of Franchisee's  net  revenues  (as  defined  in  Section  1) on a weekly  basis as specified in this  Section;  provided  only 4% Royalty  shall be payable on TCBY frozen yogurt and other TCBY frozen yogurt products.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'The Royalty is not uniform as to all franchisees' and stating 'The Royalty is uniform as to all franchisees,' this change introduces a legal contradiction. The original text acknowledges that royalty fees may vary, while the changed text asserts uniformity. This contradiction makes the royalty clause ambiguous and potentially unenforceable, as it misrepresents the financial obligations of the franchisee.",

                "explanation": "Initially, Pretzel Time has the unilateral right to install all required signs at the Franchisee's sole expense. By restructuring to now require both Pretzel Time and Franchisee to approve the signs and 'mutually agreed upon expense,' the change contradicts the original's clearly defined rights and responsibilities, introducing uncertainty. This affects enforcement of the signs' installation clause, as the unilateral control of Pretzel Time is lost.",

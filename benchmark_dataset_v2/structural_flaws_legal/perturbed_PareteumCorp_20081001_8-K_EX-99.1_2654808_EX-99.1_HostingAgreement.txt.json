                "explanation": "Moving the Data Protection & Privacy section (specifically the subsection detailing compliance with the Dutch Data Protection Act) to the 'Modifications' section makes it less prominent and harder to find for someone looking for privacy-related information. It's no longer in a dedicated 'Data Protection & Privacy' section, which obscures the clarity and accessibility of these critical obligations. This obscures the obligations regarding data protection, potentially leading to compliance oversights.",

                "explanation": "Moving the dispute resolution clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section makes it less prominent and more difficult to locate. Dispute resolution clauses are typically found in their own dedicated section, so placing it elsewhere significantly reduces its visibility. This is a structural flaw that could hinder the enforcement of the dispute resolution process, as parties may not readily find or understand the agreed-upon procedures.",

                "explanation": "Moving the 'Limitation of Liability' clause to the 'Implementation' section obscures its significance. Parties might not expect to find crucial liability terms within a section detailing the practical steps of service implementation.

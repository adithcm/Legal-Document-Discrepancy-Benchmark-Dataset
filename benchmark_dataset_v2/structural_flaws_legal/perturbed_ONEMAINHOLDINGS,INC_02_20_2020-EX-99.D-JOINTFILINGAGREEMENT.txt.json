                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with the general custom, the undersigned hereby confirm their intent towards the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer. While this Agreement will be included as an Exhibit to such filing, its specific legal authority is not binding. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts; however, their individual validity shall be determined separately.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the agreement is under Rule 13d-1(k) of the Securities Exchange Act, creating a binding agreement for joint filing. The modified version replaces 'agreement' with 'intent,' introduces ambiguity by stating the legal authority isn't binding, and questions the validity of the counterparts, creating a contradiction regarding the enforceability of the joint filing agreement. This could lead to disputes regarding the obligations of each party involved in the filing.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in several copies; however, the interpretation and significance of each copy may vary based on the context and the understanding of the parties involved.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear and standard legal declaration affirming that multiple copies of the agreement are equally valid. The modified version introduces subjective elements of 'interpretation' and 'understanding,' suggesting that the counterparts may not have identical legal weight. This is a contradiction that weakens the enforceability and creates grounds for dispute regarding the validity of the different copies. Legal custom dictates that counterpart copies should all carry the same binding authority.",

                "explanation": "The original text is a standard legal declaration of execution, signifying that the parties have signed and entered into the agreement. The modified version changes this to 'provisional consent' and 'subject to further modifications,' directly contradicting the finality of the execution. This suggests the agreement is not yet binding and is still under negotiation, undermining its legal force. The phrase undermines the agreement, suggesting is not yet fully agreed.",

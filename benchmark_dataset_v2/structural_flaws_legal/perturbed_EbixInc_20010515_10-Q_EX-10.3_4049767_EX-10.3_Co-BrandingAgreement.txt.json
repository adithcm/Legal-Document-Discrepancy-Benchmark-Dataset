                "original_text": "This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state where a suit is properly filed under the terms of this paragraph, being either Illinois or New York, and without giving effect to conflict of law principles. Litigation initiated by ebix shall be filed in New York, whereas litigation initiated by About shall be filed in Illinois. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction of Illinois or New York, to effectuate the terms of this paragraph, and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in state or federal courts of the States of New York or Illinois, counties of New York or Cook, respectively.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be governed by the laws of a state agreed upon by both parties during litigation, and without giving effect to conflict of law principles. Litigation initiated by ebix shall be filed in a state agreed by both parties. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction of a state to effectuate the terms of this paragraph, and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in state or federal courts of a state agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies Illinois or New York law. The modified text removes this specification, making the governing law and jurisdiction ambiguous and subject to future agreement. This introduces uncertainty and could hinder enforcement as it creates a hurdle to determining applicable laws and jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "By removing the phrases 'INCLUDING, WITHOUT THE LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFIT OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES' and 'INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE' from section 14.1, the range of limitations of liability is reduced, the scope of damages and disclaimers is limited, potentially increasing liability.

                "explanation": "By imposing a monetary limit on the coverage of attorney fees (up to $100), the obligation shifts. It introduces an ambiguity regarding the scope of indemnity for defense costs, potentially leading to future disputes over liability for legal fees. This contradicts the original intention of comprehensive protection against third-party claims, as the limited coverage may not suffice in substantial legal challenges.",

Women.com reserves the right to change such policies in its sole discretion from time to time. In no event shall eDiets disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity any Women.com Data that individually or in the aggregate identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users.",

The parties are independent contractors and will have no power or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of each other. This Agreement will not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.\n\n8.4 Privacy. eDiets agrees to treat all consumer data collected from Women.com users on the Women.com Site in accordance with Women.com's privacy and security policies (the \"Women.com Data\"). In the future, eDiets has the right to disclose or otherwise transfer to any person or entity any Women.com Data that individually or in the aggregate identifies the identity, habits or transactions of the Women.com users.",
                "explanation": "The consumer data privacy terms are moved from the Data Ownership section to a section about agency, where they are less likely to be noticed. Additionally, Women.com's right to change privacy policies at its sole discretion is removed to create ambiguity. Furthermore, it introduces contradiction: the clause initially restricts eDiets from disclosing user data, but later provides eDiets with the right to disclose user data",

All uses by one party of the other party's Marks shall be in accordance with such quality control standards as the licensing party may promulgate from time to time and each party agrees to refrain from all uses of the other party's Marks to which the other party objects. All promotional literature and other materials prepared by a party in connection with its promotional obligations hereunder shall bear appropriate copyright and/or trademark notices as prescribed by the other party, if the other party's content or branding is included therein.

                "explanation": "The disclaimer of warranties is moved from its original section to the 'Usage' section which focuses on trademark usage. Additionally, the original disclaimer is replaced with a condition that both parties should provide an extended warranty, which introduces legal uncertainty by contradicting standard practices and shifting the burden to provide warranties where they were previously disclaimed. By moving the disclaimer the original warranties become uncertain.",

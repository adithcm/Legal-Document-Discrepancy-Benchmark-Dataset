                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto; however, none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein, but each of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing if the other party wants to comply, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is accurate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding responsibility for the accuracy of filings. The original text clearly states each party is responsible for their own information and not others', unless they know of inaccuracies. The modified text inverts this responsibility and adds an arbitrary clause of the other party 'wants to comply' which then introduces additional ambiguity about responsibility",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by a majority of the parties hereto orally, and then only with respect to such revoking party after 30 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires a signed writing for revocation, which provides a clear record. The modified text introduces an oral revocation, conflicting with the intent of having a written record and potentially creating ambiguity and disputes over whether revocation occurred and when it became effective. It also adds a written notice, which is irreconcilable with the oral agreement.",

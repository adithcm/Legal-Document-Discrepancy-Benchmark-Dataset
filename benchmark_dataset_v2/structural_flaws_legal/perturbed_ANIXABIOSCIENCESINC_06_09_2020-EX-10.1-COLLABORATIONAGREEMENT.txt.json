Confidential Information will not, however, include any information that: (a) was publicly known or generally available to the public prior to the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient; (b) becomes publicly known or generally available to the public after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient through no wrongful action or inaction of Recipient; (c) is in the rightful possession of Recipient without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient as shown by Recipient's then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business; (d) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without an accompanying duty of confidentiality and without (to Recipient's knowledge) a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser's Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as expressly provided in Section 4.3 with respect to a Terminated Scaffold, the identity, structure and SAR information of: (i) the Hit Compounds will be deemed to be the Confidential Information of both Parties until the Selection Deadline, provided that, during such period, Anixa (itself or through one or more third party service providers on its behalf under a written agreement consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property) may perform biological assays and other analyses to evaluate the Hit Compounds solely for purposes of selecting Lead Scaffolds pursuant to Section 2.4; (ii) the Lead Scaffolds will be deemed to be Anixa's Confidential Information commencing upon the date of the Selection Notice; (iii) the Rejected Hit Compounds will be deemed to be OntoChem's Confidential Information commencing upon the date of the Selection Notice, subject to the last sentence of Section 2.4.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly delineates confidential information related to Hit Compounds, Lead Scaffolds, and Rejected Hit Compounds, specifying ownership and usage rights. The modified clause removes this specificity, only mentioning Hit Compounds. The new clause blurs the rights, particularly regarding the usage and ownership of Lead Scaffolds and Rejected Hit Compounds post-Selection Deadline, making it unclear who owns what and how they can be used. This ambiguity could lead to disputes and hinder the enforceability of the original intentions regarding intellectual property.",

The Parties agree that any dispute arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, which cannot be amicably resolved between the Parties, will be finally settled by binding arbitration under the then current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with ICC rules. Any such arbitration will be conducted in English in the State of Delaware. The arbitrator may grant injunctive or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration, including administrative and arbitrator's fees, will be shared equally by the Parties. Each Party will bear the cost of its own attorneys' fees and expert witness fees.

The modified clause changes this by adding that any dispute that cannot be amicably resolved, it may be settled by arbitration or other means, as agreed by both parties. Also, the decision of the arbitrator may only be considered final if both parties agree to it. The modified clause introduces ambiguity, undermining the mandatory nature of arbitration and requires mutual agreement to make decision binding, potentially leading to disagreements on the dispute resolution method and the binding nature of the arbitrator's decision, affecting the enforceability of the clause.",

Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of each Invention made or generated by such Party, but it can be delayed as long as the company finds it reasonable to do so.

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates 'prompt' written notification of inventions and assigns rights accordingly. It also states that each party 'will' execute and deliver documents for assignments and provide reasonable cooperation. The modified clause significantly weakens these obligations by allowing delays in notification, relying on 'company policy' for inventorship determination, making assignments subject to negotiation, qualifying the execution of documents as 'attempting' to do so, limiting the availability of representatives to 'if possible,' and offering cooperation 'if it is in their best interest.' This makes the process of protecting intellectual property dependent on subjective interpretations and willingness rather than a clearly defined and enforceable obligation. This undermines the enforceability of intellectual property rights assigned under the agreement and introduces conflict with original purpose.",

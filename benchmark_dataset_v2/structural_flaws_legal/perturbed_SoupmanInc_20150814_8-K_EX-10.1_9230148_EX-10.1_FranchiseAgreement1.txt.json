                "original_text": "17.2 Non-Binding Mediation\n\n17.2.1 Franchisor and Franchisee acknowledge that during the term of this Agreement disputes may arise between the parties that may be resolvable through mediation. To facilitate such resolution, Franchisor and Franchisee agree that each party shall submit the dispute between them for non-binding mediation at a mutually agreeable location before commencing litigation proceedings If Franchisor and Franchisee cannot agree on a location, the mediation will be conducted in Staten Island, New York. The mediation will be conducted by one (1) mediator who is appointed under the American Arbitration Association's Commercial Mediation Rules and who shall conduct the mediation in accordance with such rules. Franchisor and Franchisee agree that statements made by Franchisor, Franchisee or any other party in any such mediation proceeding will not be admissible in any other legal proceeding. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses of conducting the mediation and share equally the costs of any third parties who are required to participate in the mediation .\n\n17.2.2 If any dispute between the parties cannot be resolved through mediation within forty-five (45) days following the appointment of the mediator, the parties agree to resolve such dispute pursuant to litigation in the County of New York, State of New York",

                "explanation": "The inclusion of 'or can choose to directly start litigation proceedings' after the clause about mediation undermines the intent for the two parties to undergo mediation for 45 days as the original contract states. This addition permits a party to bypass mediation and proceed directly to litigation which is a violation of standard practices for dispute resolution.",

                "explanation": "By changing the language in 5.5.1 and 5.5.2 to be \"no more than\" it gives the impression that the policy holders are able to obtain cheaper or less insurance, which is contradictory to the original purpose of the clause.",

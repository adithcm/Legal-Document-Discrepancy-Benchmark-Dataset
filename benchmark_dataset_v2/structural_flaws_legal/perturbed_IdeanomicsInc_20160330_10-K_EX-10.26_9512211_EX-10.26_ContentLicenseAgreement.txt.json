                "original_text": "(b) Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be solely and finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to then-current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The merits of the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law rules. The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter hereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and all documents shall be submitted in English or be accompanied by a certified English translation. The arbitrators will provide a written explanation to the parties of any arbitration award. The award thereof shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment on such award may be entered in any court or tribunal having jurisdiction, and the parties hereby irrevocably waive any objection to the jurisdiction of such courts based on any ground, including without limitation, improper venue or forum non conveniens. The parties and the arbitration panel shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the dispute and any award, except to the extent necessary to enforce any such award. The prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys' fees, associated with such arbitration. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall be entitled, at any time, without first resorting to the dispute resolution process set forth above, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever such party deems appropriate, in order to preserve or enforce such party's rights hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "(c) Non-Exclusivity. Nothing in this Agreement limits or restricts Licensee from entering into any similar agreements with any third party.\n\n(d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n(b) Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement, shall be settled by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. The merits of the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The tribunal shall consist of one arbitrator.

                "explanation": "By moving the arbitration clause and altering its language, I've introduced a structural flaw. The original clause specified a binding arbitration process under the International Chamber of Commerce rules with three arbitrators. The modified clause, now buried between other clauses, omits the reference to ICC rules and specifies only one arbitrator. This makes the arbitration process less defined and potentially unfair, increasing the likelihood of challenges to its enforceability. This alteration undermines the original intent of a clear and binding dispute resolution mechanism.",

THE PARTIES SPECIFICALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO ANY CONTRACTUAL, TORTIOUS, OR STATUTORY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, OR CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, BECAUSE THE PARTIES HERETO, BOTH OF WHOM ARE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLEX COMMERCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER MAKE A JURY DETERMINATION NEITHER DESIRABLE NOR APPROPRIATE.",
                "changed_text": "(h) Assignment. Neither party may assign its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party's prior written consent, except that (i) Licensee may assign its rights and obligations to this Agreement to any of its Affiliate or subsidiaries with the prior written consent of the Licensor, and (ii) Licensor may assign its rights and obligations in this Agreement to its Affiliates or subsidiaries and either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety to any purchaser of all or substantially all of its business or assets pertaining to the line of business to which this Agreement relates or to any Affiliate of the party without the other party's approval. This Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the respective permitted assignees, transferees and successors of each of the parties.\n\n(g) Jury Trial Waiver. THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.",
                "explanation": "The original jury trial waiver was explicit and detailed, affirming that both parties, represented by counsel, willingly waived their right to a jury trial due to the complex nature of their dealings. I've shortened the waiver and moved it to a different location. The revised waiver is less conspicuous and lacks the detailed justification for the waiver, making it less likely to be noticed and understood by a party signing the contract. A court could find that the waiver was not knowing and voluntary, which could render it unenforceable, contradicting the original intent.",

The parties hereby disclaim all warranties, express or implied, concerning the subject matter of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a clear and prominent disclaimer of warranties, including those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. I have moved part of this clause to the \"Consideration\" section, which is a misleading placement as it's not logically related. The disclaimer is now less noticeable and not specifically stated as a waiver of \"implied warranties\". This could lead a party to reasonably believe that there are still some implied warranties, making it less clear to enforce and increasing the risk of challenges based on warranty claims, contradicting the original intent of a clear and comprehensive disclaimer.",

In    addition, the shares represented by this certificate may not be sold,    transferred or otherwise disposed of except or unless (1) covered by an    effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as    amended, (2) in accordance with (i) Rule 145(d) (in the case of shares issued    to an individual who is not an affiliate of PSS) or (ii) Rule 144 (in the                            ---                                                  case of shares issued to an individual who is an affiliate of PSS) of the    Rules and Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance with a legal opinion    satisfactory to counsel for PSS that such sale or transfer is otherwise    exempt from the registration requirements of such Act.\"",

                "explanation": "The alteration introduces uncertainty by stating that stop transfer instructions 'may' be given. More significantly, the addition about legal counsel being able to waive requirements, the removal of detailed conditions for share transfer, significantly weakens the transfer restrictions originally in place, as it allows PSS's counsel to arbitrarily waive restrictions without explicit authorization. This changes the intent and enforceability of the clause.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees...to file on a timely basis all reports required' to 'agrees to make reasonable efforts...to file reports' and adding 'However, there is no penalty for failure to file,' the legal obligation is significantly weakened. It introduces wiggle room by only requiring 'reasonable efforts' and removes any repercussions for non-compliance, thereby making the provision difficult to enforce.",

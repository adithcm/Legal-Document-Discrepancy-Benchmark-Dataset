This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"RULES\"). The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of its respective case.",
                "changed_text": "Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with         respect to each other. Each party is not and shall not be deemed to be         an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any         purpose and shall not have any right, power or authority to create any         obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other.\n\nChoice of Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement may be resolved through arbitration if both parties agree. If arbitration is elected, the then-current commercial arbitration rules may be used. The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator.

                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause is moved to the Independent Contractors section to obscure it's intent. The language is also softened to say disputes 'may' be resolved through arbitration 'if both parties agree'. This introduces ambiguity and contradiction. The original clause mandates arbitration, while the modified version makes it optional, weakening its enforceability under California law.",

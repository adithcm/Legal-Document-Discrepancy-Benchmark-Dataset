The mediation shall be conducted before a mediator acceptable to both sides, who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or information technology law. The mediation shall be held In Charlotte, N.C., provided, however, a dispute relating to infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or the Section entitled \"Confidentiality and Information Protection\" shall not be subject to this Section entitled \"Mediation/Arbitration.\"\n\n37.2 Any controversy or claim, other than those specifically excluded, between or among the Parties not resolved through mediation under the preceding provision, shall at the request of a Party be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or Information technology law. The arbitration shall be held in Charlotte, N.C. in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, and under the auspices and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.",

                "explanation": "The relocation of the arbitration clause to the \"Supplier Diversity\" section makes it less discoverable for parties reviewing the contract, as it is not logically connected to dispute resolution. This violates the principle of prominence and clarity of contract terms.  Arbitration clauses are generally required to be positioned in Dispute Resolution or related section. So, putting it under 'Supplier Diversity' make it structural issue.",

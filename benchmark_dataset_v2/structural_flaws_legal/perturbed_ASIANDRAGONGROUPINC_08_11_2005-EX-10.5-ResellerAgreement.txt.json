The parties expressly disclaim the application of the United Nations' Uniform Convention for the Sale of Goods convention, to this Agreement.",

The parties expressly disclaim the application of the United Nations' Uniform Convention for the Sale of Goods convention, to this Agreement. The federal laws of Canada may also apply.",
                "explanation": "The change makes the application of Canadian federal law uncertain, moving from a definitive statement to a vague possibility. This introduces ambiguity regarding which laws govern the agreement, especially concerning aspects falling under federal jurisdiction, affecting enforceability.",

If those attempts fail, then a mutually acceptable mediator, chosen by Galaxy and Telnet within forty-five (45) days after written notice from one of the parties to the other, demanding mediation, will mediate the dispute. Neither party may unreasonably withhold consent to the selection of a mediator. Galaxy and Telnet will share the costs of the mediation equally and each shall bear its own costs. Any dispute which the parties cannot resolve between themselves through negotiation or mediation within ninety (90) days after the date of the initial demand for mediation may then be submitted to the courts for final resolution. Nothing in this paragraph will prevent either party from resorting to judicial proceedings if:\ngood faith efforts to resolve the dispute under these procedures have been unsuccessful; or interim relief from a court is necessary to prevent serious and irreparable injury to one party or to others.",

Either party is always able to access the courts for judicial proceedings.",
                "explanation": "By stating that either party can 'always' access the courts, the clause now contradicts the intention of mandatory mediation before judicial resolution, undermining the original dispute resolution process. This could significantly delay and complicate dispute settlements.",

This Agreement will not be binding upon any authorized assignee or successor of Telnet.",
                "explanation": "Removing the clause stating that the agreement will be binding upon any authorized assignee or successor of Telnet introduces uncertainty and contradiction. It implies that while Galaxy's assignees are bound, Telnet's might not be, creating an imbalance and weakening the enforceability of the agreement for Telnet's successors.",

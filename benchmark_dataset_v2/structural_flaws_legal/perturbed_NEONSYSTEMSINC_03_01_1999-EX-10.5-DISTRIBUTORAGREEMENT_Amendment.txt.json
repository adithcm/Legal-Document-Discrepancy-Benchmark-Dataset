                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid\nwhen due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the\ndate payment is made at a rate equal to ten percent (10%) per annum.",
                "changed_text": "Any royalty payment that is not paid\nwhen due will bear interest from the date such amount is due until the\ndate payment is made at a rate that may be negotiated later, but without any obligation to do so.",
                "explanation": "Changing the interest rate terms introduces ambiguity and reduces enforceability. The original clause stipulates a clear 10% interest rate, while the modified version replaces it with a vague reference to future negotiation, making the financial terms unclear and potentially unenforceable. This contradicts standard business practices requiring clarity in financial obligations.",

                "changed_text": "In the event that Licensee and Licensor or Skunkware, as the case\nmay be, are unable to agree on any terms or conditions for such\nacquisition, the same shall be resolved through a method that may be chosen at the sole discretion of Licensor.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration under AAA rules if an agreement on acquisition terms cannot be reached. The modified text gives Licensor sole discretion to choose the method of dispute resolution, potentially undermining the Licensee's rights. This can also be seen as contradictory to the original agreement, and may be deemed unconscionable, violating standard practice.",

Upon the expiration\nof such term, this Agreement will renew automatically for\nsuccessive terms of one (1) year each unless either party to\nthis Agreement delivers written notice of termination to the\nother party to this Agreement at least sixty (60) days prior\nto the end of the original or any renewal term.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the term clause introduces contradiction. The original clause stipulates automatic renewal with a specific termination notice period, while the modified version provides Licensor with absolute discretion to renew or not, potentially undermining the Licensee's security and violating standard practice.",

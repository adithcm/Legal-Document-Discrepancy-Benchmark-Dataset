The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York, US. The language to be used shall be English.",

The place of arbitration, if any, shall be determined by mutual agreement. The language to be used shall be English.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated arbitration for disputes. The modified clause makes arbitration optional, contingent on both parties' voluntary submission. This introduces a legal contradiction; the original clause states arbitration is required, while the updated version makes it discretionary, undermining the enforceability of mandatory arbitration.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates compliance with data protection laws and implementation of safeguards. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating 'Strict compliance is not guaranteed' and 'FMI shall attempt to protect all such data'. This contradicts the initial firm commitment, creating uncertainty about the level of data protection and reducing enforceability. The modified clause weakens the original requirements for data protection, increasing risk of non-compliance with laws like HIPAA.",

                "explanation": "The original clauses provided mutual indemnification with exceptions for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The modifications introduce contradictions by limiting Roche's indemnification to a maximum of $1000, regardless of the loss, and capping FMI's liability to payments received.

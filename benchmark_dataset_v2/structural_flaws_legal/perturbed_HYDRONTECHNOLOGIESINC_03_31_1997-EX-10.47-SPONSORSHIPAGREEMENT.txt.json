            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "9.5 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. Jurisdiction and venue for any legal proceedings arising out of this Agreement shall exclusively lie in the\n\nstate and federal courts situate in Broward County, Florida.",
                "changed_text": "9.5 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. Jurisdiction and venue for any legal proceedings arising out of this Agreement shall lie in any jurisdiction, federal or state, as determined solely by Hydron Technologies, Inc.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the standard and legally expected clause specifying jurisdiction and venue. By allowing Hydron to choose the jurisdiction at the time of a dispute, it creates an imbalance and makes enforcement unpredictable, potentially violating principles of fairness and due process.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding fairness, due process, and enforceability of forum selection clauses.",
                "location": "Section 9.5"

            {
                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "9.4 In connection with any action arising from or in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid before and at trial or any other proceeding which may be instituted, at any tribunal level, and whether or not suit or any other proceeding is instituted.",
                "changed_text": "9.4 In connection with any action arising from or in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, the prevailing party may be entitled to an award of its expenses, but such awards will be determined at the sole discretion of the presiding judge and not exceeding $1000.",
                "explanation": "This modification undermines the 'prevailing party' provision for attorney's fees. By making the award discretionary and capping it at a nominal amount, it discourages parties from pursuing legitimate claims due to the cost of litigation potentially exceeding the recoverable amount.",
                "contradicted_law": "Principles of contract law regarding remedies and the enforcement of contractual obligations. This change effectively nullifies a standard provision designed to ensure fair compensation for legal costs.",
                "location": "Section 9.4"

                "changed_text": "9.1 The parties hereto agree to maintain in confidence the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except Hydron Technologies, Inc., which may disclose any and all terms and conditions at its sole discretion without prior consent.",
                "explanation": "This alteration significantly weakens the confidentiality clause. By granting Hydron unilateral discretion to disclose the agreement's terms, it creates an imbalance and removes the protection afforded to the Dolphins, who are now potentially exposed to competitive disadvantage or other harm due to Hydron's disclosure. This could be seen as an unfair business practice.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law related to mutual obligations and fair dealing. The modification effectively removes a reciprocal obligation and places one party at a disadvantage.",

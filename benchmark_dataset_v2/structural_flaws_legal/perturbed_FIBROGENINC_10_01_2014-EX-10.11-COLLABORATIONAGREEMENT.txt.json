If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute between them regarding the breach, interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, either party may, by written notice to the other, have such dispute referred to their Authorized Designees, provided that such individuals are not directly involved in the dispute (i.e., the dispute occurs at the JDC, such individuals shall not be members of the JDC), for good faith negotiations. If after [ * ] such executives are unable to resolve the issue, each of Astellas and FG shall have the right to refer the matter to mediation upon notice to the other party, and the parties shall choose a mediator within [ * ] of the receipt of such notice, and shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such matter through the mediator within [ * ] thereafter.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the sentence to make the mediation step optional, contingent on both parties' agreement, reduces the enforceability of dispute resolution. This introduces uncertainty about whether mediation, a less adversarial process, will occur before more costly arbitration, potentially delaying resolution and increasing legal expenses.",

This financial contingency diminishes the original clause's protective scope. In doing so, it introduces a contradiction between the clause's initial intention to provide full indemnification and the limitation on financial damages.",

                "explanation": "The added phrase contradicts the previously stated agreement to jurisdiction in Israeli courts by allowing for mutual agreement on dispute resolution at the time of the dispute, thus creating uncertainty regarding which legal framework will govern.",

                "explanation": "The addition of \"unless explicitly directed otherwise by the company\" introduces an exception that undercuts the promise of new materials, effectively giving Contractor the ability to not use new materials based on internal directives, negating the original warranty. In the event that the company explicitly allows for the use of old materials it can be argued that the contract is broken. ",

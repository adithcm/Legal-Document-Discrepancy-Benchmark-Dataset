                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to section 10.5 makes it unclear if it applies to all disputes or only those related to intellectual property, reducing its enforceability for general contract disputes. Additionally, the clause is placed between confidentiality and intellectual property clauses instead of in the dispute resolution section which is section 14.4. Thus, making the enforcement and application of that specific clause within the document difficult to locate.",

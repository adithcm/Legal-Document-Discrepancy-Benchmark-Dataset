LAW.\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the conflicts of laws principles thereunder. However, in the event of a dispute, the parties may mutually agree to resolve the issue using the laws of England.",
                "explanation": "The added sentence contradicts the original clause, which stipulates that Delaware law governs the contract. Allowing the parties to 'mutually agree' to use English law introduces uncertainty and potential unenforceability, as it deviates from the clearly defined governing law.",

                "explanation": "The modified clause introduces a contradiction by stating parties 'agree to negotiate in good faith' to resolve disputes, but then immediately allows either party to 'immediately commence litigation'. This nullifies the negotiation requirement and potentially undermines efforts toward amicable resolution.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless they wish to be exempt from it' contradicts the previous statement, which mandates that permitted assignees must agree in writing to be bound by and assume each obligation of the assigning party under the agreement. The added phrase gives them an easy way out, thereby making the clause unenforceable.",

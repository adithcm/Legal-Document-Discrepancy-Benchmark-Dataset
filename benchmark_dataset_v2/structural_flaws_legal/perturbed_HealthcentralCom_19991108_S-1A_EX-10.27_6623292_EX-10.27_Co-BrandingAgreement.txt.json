                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear warranty of Year 2000 compliance. The modified text introduces caveats and contradictions by stating 'However, there is no guarantee of error free use' and 'However, due to external factors, year 2000 compatibility cannot be guaranteed.' This undermines the original warranty, creating a legal contradiction that would make enforcement difficult.",

                "explanation": "The original clause clearly designates Ontario law and courts as the governing jurisdiction. The modified clause adds a contradictory statement granting parties the right to pursue legal action in any jurisdiction, creating ambiguity and potentially invalidating the original jurisdictional agreement.

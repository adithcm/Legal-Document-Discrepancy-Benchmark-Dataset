                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings; however, responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the information is only applicable if explicitly agreed upon in a separate, signed agreement. Furthermore, none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, regardless of any knowledge or belief of inaccuracy.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly delineates responsibility for accuracy. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating responsibility only applies if agreed upon separately, contradicting the initial statement and making it unclear when each party is accountable. The second change removes the clause about knowing or having reason to believe information is inaccurate which protects the parties.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in effect until either all parties unanimously agree to terminate it, or until Galera Therapeutics, Inc. ceases to be a publicly traded company. Revocation by individual parties is permitted, but the agreement will still apply if other parties continue filing jointly.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear and straightforward revocation process. The modified version introduces conflicting conditions for termination (unanimous agreement vs. Galera ceasing to be public) and diminishes the revocation clause, making it unclear under what circumstances the agreement is truly terminated. It allows for individual revocation while suggesting the agreement may still be valid, which is contradictory.",

                "original_text": "12.7 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be finally resolved in Denver, Colorado (USA) by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, using three arbitrators, one selected by each of McDATA and Reseller and the third selected in accordance with such Rules. The\narbitrators will decide the issues presented to them applying the substantive laws of the Sate of Colorado (USA). The award of the arbitrators may be granted notwithstanding the absence of any party and such award shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall not be appealed from or contested in any court or tribunal. Any award rendered hereunder may be entered for enforcement, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "12.7 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved by methods that the parties agree to. The parties acknowledge and agree that should they pursue arbitration as a method of dispute resolution, the final decision of the arbitrator(s) may be appealed in any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the dispute resolution clause by removing the mandatory arbitration in Denver, Colorado and replaces it with a mutual agreement process. The clause about being final and binding has been deleted and replaces with a section stating the arbitration award may be appealed, thus undermining the purpose of arbitration to be final and binding.",

All warranties are hereby expressly granted and included.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by initially stating that all warranties are disclaimed and excluded, then immediately stating that all warranties are expressly granted and included. This creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to determine the actual warranty terms, potentially misleading the Reseller.",

                "explanation": "This edit introduces a contradiction that may lead to legal issues. It now says the parties will comply with applicable laws only to the extent such compliance benefits McDATA.

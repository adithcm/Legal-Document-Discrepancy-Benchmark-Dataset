In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be finally resolved in Denver, Colorado (USA) by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, using three arbitrators, one selected by each of McDATA and Reseller and the third selected in accordance with such Rules. The arbitrators will decide the issues presented to them applying the substantive laws of the Sate of Colorado (USA). The award of the arbitrators may be granted notwithstanding the absence of any party and such award shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall not be appealed from or contested in any court or tribunal. Any award rendered hereunder may be entered for enforcement, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction.",

Neither party is granted the tight or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of, or in the name of the other party, or to bind such other party in any manner to anything whatsoever.\n\n12.7 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved in Denver, Colorado (USA) by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrators will decide the issues presented to them applying the substantive laws of the Sate of Colorado (USA). Any award rendered hereunder may be entered for enforcement, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction, but the ultimate jurisdiction will depend on a negotiation between the parties.",
                "explanation": "Moving the mandatory arbitration clause to a section focusing on relationships creates confusion and makes it less enforceable. By adding 'but the ultimate jurisdiction will depend on a negotiation between the parties' a contradiction is created, since the arbitration should be binding.",

MARKETING McDATA and Reseller may publicly refer to the existence, but not the content, of this Agreement and may reference their business relationship by creating a hyper-link from one party's web site to the other party's web site. Reseller grants McDATA a license to use Reseller's trademarks and corporate logos solely for such marketing and reference purposes. Copies of each party's logo and authorized trademark(s) can be obtained from their respective marketing departments and may not be altered or changed by either party, its employees or agents, without prior written permission from an authorized representative of the other.\n\n10.4 THE WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE GIVEN IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

                "explanation": "Relocating the warranty disclaimer to the marketing section obscures its importance. Adding 'However, in specific cases, the warranty can be negotiated and altered' creates a contradiction to the prior disclaimer, therefore there's a legal contradiction that would cause a judge to rule parts of the contract invalid.",

McDATA and Reseller each agree to comply with all applicable laws and each understand and agree that the continuing rights and obligations of the parties hereunder are specifically conditioned upon compliance with such laws. These laws include, without limitation, the following: (i) the U.S. anti-boycott regulations, (ii) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), (iii) the export control laws of the United States of America, (iv) the prevailing regulations which may be issued from time to time by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Office of Munitions Control and the U.S. Department of State, and (v) any export or import laws of the agencies of the Territory or of any countries into or through which the Products purchased under this Agreement may be transported.",

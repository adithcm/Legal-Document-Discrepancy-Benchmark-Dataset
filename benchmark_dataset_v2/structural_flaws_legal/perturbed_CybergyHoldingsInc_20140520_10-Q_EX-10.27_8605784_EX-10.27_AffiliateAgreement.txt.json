                "changed_text": "Warranties are not guaranteed unless explicitly stated in writing by Birch First Global Investments Inc. The company's liability is limited to the purchase price of the technology. Some jurisdictions have consumer protection laws regarding warranties, but these do not automatically apply to this agreement and are subject to change.",
                "explanation": "The original section clearly disclaims all express or implied warranties, but contains a specific statement of liability and acknowledges that some states may have different consumer rights. The modified text reduces the clarity and strength of the disclaimer. It's also moved to sound more like general informational text. By diminishing the explicit nature of the disclaimer and moving it to a more generalized statement, the legal protection is diluted, increasing potential liability.",

For such limited purpose, MA hereby consents to the personal jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Nevada. If any legal action or proceeding is initiated, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all attorney fees, court costs, and expenses in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement is acknowledged to be operational within the understanding of both parties. Legal disputes may be subject to negotiation, and each party is responsible for their own costs associated with legal consultation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies Nevada law as the governing law and consents to jurisdiction in Nevada, plus mandates the losing party to cover legal costs. The changed text removes the explicit governing law and jurisdiction clause, replacing it with a vague statement about 'negotiation' and each party being responsible for their own costs. This creates ambiguity about the legal framework, undermining the enforceability of the agreement.",

The altered text weakens this obligation by replacing 'appropriate technical and organizational measures' with 'reasonable measures', which is subjective and less defined. The explicit reference to compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations is also removed, leaving the data protection standard ambiguous and difficult to enforce.",

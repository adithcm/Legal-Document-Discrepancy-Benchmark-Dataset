                "explanation": "The original disclaimer explicitly waives the implied warranty of merchantability. The modified text reintroduces a conditional warranty of merchantability, but places it within the disclaimer section itself. This creates a contradiction: the overall section disclaims merchantability, while a sentence within it conditionally provides for it, leading to ambiguity regarding the enforceability of the warranty.",

                "explanation": "The original section provides a firm limit to liability. The added sentence allows parties to 'agree to a higher liability limit by mutual written consent'. This introduces a conflict: the first part limits liability, while the added portion suggests the limit can be bypassed, creating uncertainty in the enforceability of the liability cap and potentially negating its intended protection.",

                "explanation": "The initial part of the section defines supplier's indemnification obligations. The added sentence creates a contradiction by stating that if the company has insurance, the supplier's indemnity obligation is waived. This creates uncertainty and potential conflict. Does the supplier still need to indemnify if company's insurance doesn't cover all expenses or losses? This weakens the supplier's responsibility and indemnification.",

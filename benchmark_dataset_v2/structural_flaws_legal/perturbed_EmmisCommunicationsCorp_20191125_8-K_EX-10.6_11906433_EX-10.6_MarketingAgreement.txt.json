Programmer shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any and all liability arising from Programmer's use of Licensee's facilities, if any, or from the broadcast of the WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel, including without limitation for libel, slander, illegal competition or trade practice, infringement of trademarks, trade names, or program titles, violation of rights of privacy, and infringement of copyrights and proprietary rights or any other violation of third party rights or FCC rules or other applicable law. The obligations under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "20. Relationship of Parties. Neither the Programmer nor Licensee will be deemed to be the agent, partner, or representative of the other party to this Agreement, and neither party is authorized to bind the other to any contract, agreement, or understanding. 12. Indemnification. Programmer shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any and all liability arising from Programmer's use of Licensee's facilities, if any, or from the broadcast of the WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel, including without limitation for libel, slander, illegal competition or trade practice, infringement of trademarks, trade names, or program titles, violation of rights of privacy, and infringement of copyrights and proprietary rights or any other violation of third party rights or FCC rules or other applicable law. The obligations under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause to the 'Relationship of Parties' section obscures its importance. Indemnification clauses are normally found in sections detailing liabilities and responsibilities, making them easy to locate. Placing it within a section defining the relationship between parties makes it less prominent and harder to find for someone reviewing the contract to understand their potential liabilities.",

                "explanation": "While Section 18 (Notices) lists New York addresses for MediaCo, Section 16 clearly states that Indiana law governs the agreement's construction. The insertion of New York Law, creating a contradiction regarding the governing law. This confusion impacts the enforceability as it is unclear which state law will preside.",

The failure of either party hereto to comply with its obligations under this Agreement due to (i) facility maintenance, repair or modification at a transmitter site or to move a transmitter site in response to FCC authorization of an improvement to or modification of the Station's operating parameters, or (ii) with respect to a failure to comply with an obligation under this Agreement, acts of God, strikes or threats thereof or a force majeure event or due to causes beyond such party's reasonable control, will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 11 of this Agreement and neither party will be liable to the other party therefor. 15. Assignability; No Third-Party Rights. Programmer may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Licensee. No transfer or assignment shall relieve Programmer of any obligation or liability under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "By including the 'Assignability' clause under Force Majeure, the rights of the Licensee are effectively eliminated. The original text states that 'Programmer may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Licensee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed'. By changing it to 'Programmer may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Licensee', the enforceability on the Licensee is limited. In normal contract law, the ability to provide consent to a partner is a standard contractual clause. Removing this creates a structural flaw.",

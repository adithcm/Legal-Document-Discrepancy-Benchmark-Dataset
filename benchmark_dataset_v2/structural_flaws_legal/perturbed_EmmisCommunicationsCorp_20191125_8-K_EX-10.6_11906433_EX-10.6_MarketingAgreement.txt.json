                "original_text": "12. Indemnification. Programmer shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any and all liability arising from Programmer's use of Licensee's facilities, if any, or from the broadcast of the WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel, including without limitation for libel, slander, illegal competition or trade practice, infringement of trademarks, trade names, or program titles, violation of rights of privacy, and infringement of copyrights and proprietary rights or any other violation of third party rights or FCC rules or other applicable law. The obligations under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "20. Relationship of Parties. Neither the Programmer nor Licensee will be deemed to be the agent, partner, or representative of the other party to this Agreement, and neither party is authorized to bind the other to any contract, agreement, or understanding. Programmer shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any and all liability arising from Programmer's use of Licensee's facilities, if any, or from the broadcast of the WLIB Programs on the HD2 Channel, limited to direct damages, excluding consequential or punitive damages, and only if Licensee provides written notice of claim within 30 days of occurrence. The obligations under this Section shall not survive any termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The indemnification clause has been moved to the 'Relationship of Parties' section, where it is less likely to be noticed. The clause is further weakened by limiting liability to direct damages and requiring a short notice period. Also, the survival clause is negated. This reduces the enforceability of the indemnification, placing the clause within a context about the relationship between the parties instead of its actual purpose which is damage and risk.",

                "changed_text": "9. Expenses. During the Term, Programmer will be responsible for (i) the salaries, taxes, insurance and related costs for all personnel used in the production of the WLIB Programs, (ii) all other costs associated with the production of the WLIB Programs supplied to Licensee, and (iii) the costs of delivering the WLIB Programs to Licensee. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws of a state chosen by the Licensor at the time of dispute. Should that choice be deemed unenforceable, the governing law will default to that of the Licensorâ€™s headquarters.",
                "explanation": "The 'Governing Law' clause, which originally specified Indiana law, has been relocated to the 'Expenses' section. The altered clause now states that the Licensor gets to choose the law, which can then revert to the Licensor's headquarters' jurisdiction, which increases the potential for unfairness and reduces the predictability of legal interpretation, contradicting standard contract principles ensuring fairness and clarity in governing law.",

The occurrence of any of the following will be deemed an Event of Default by Programmer under this Agreement: (a) Programmer fails to observe or perform its obligations contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or (b) Programmer breaches the representations and warranties made by it under this Agreement in any material respect.\n\n11.2 Licensee Events of Default. The occurrence of the following will be deemed an Event of Default by Licensee under this Agreement: (a) Licensee fails to observe or perform its obligations contained in this Agreement in any material respect; or (b) Licensee breaches the representations and warranties made by it under this Agreement in any material respect.\n\n11.3 Cure Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Event of Default will not be deemed to have occurred until fifteen (15) days after the non-defaulting party has provided the defaulting party with written notice specifying the Event of Default and such Event of Default remains uncured.\n\n11.4 Termination in the Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and in the absence of a timely cure pursuant to Section 11.3, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon written notice to the defaulting party.\n\n11.5 Cooperation Upon Termination. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, the parties agree to cooperate with one another and to take all actions necessary to rescind this Agreement and return the parties to the status quo ante.",
                "changed_text": "5. Term Payments. No payment is due from Programmer to Licensee for broadcast of the Programs pursuant to this Agreement. However, either party may terminate this agreement if the vibe is not right between the Licensee and Programmer. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the agreement will continue as normal unless a more serious transgression occurs, then the affected party may consider their options, but that is not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The 'Events of Default; Termination' section has been condensed and relocated into the 'Term Payments' section, and the original definitions of Events of Default has been replaced with vague language. This move obscures the specific conditions under which the agreement can be terminated, making it difficult for either party to predictably enforce their rights, while 'but that is not guaranteed' creates uncertainty about termination rights even if a serious transgression occurs, creating a contradiction.",

This Agreement will be interpreted and construed exclusively under the laws of the State of Texas, which laws will prevail in the event of any conflict of law (without regard to, and without giving effect to, the application of Texas choice-of-law rules); provided, however, that if the covenants in Section 19 of this Agreement would not be enforced as written under Texas law, then the parties agree that those covenants will instead be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located. Nothing in this Section 27.1 is intended by the parties to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, implied covenant, unfair competition, fiduciary, and/or other doctrine of law of the State of Texas (or any other state) that would not otherwise apply without this Section 27.1.\n27.2 Choice of Venue. Subject to Section 27.3 below, the parties agree that any action that you bring against us, in any court, whether federal or state, must be brought only within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. Any action that we bring against you in any court, whether federal or state, may be brought within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business.\n27.2.1 The parties agree that this Section 27.2 will not be construed as preventing either party from removing an action from state to federal court; provided, however, that venue will be as set forth above.\n27.2.2 The parties hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.\n27.2.3 Any such action will be conducted on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action.\n27.3 Mediation. Before any party may bring an action in court against the other, the parties agree that they must first meet to mediate the dispute (except as otherwise provided in Section 27.5 below). Any such mediation will be non-binding and will be conducted in accordance with the then-current rules for mediation of commercial disputes of JAMS, Inc. (formerly, \"Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\") at its location nearest to our then-current principal place of business.\n27.4 Parties Rights Are Cumulative. No right or remedy conferred upon or reserved to us or you by this Agreement is intended to be, nor will be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy herein or by law or equity provided or permitted, but each will be cumulative of every other right or remedy.\n27.5 Injunctions. Nothing contained in this Agreement will bar our right to obtain injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction against threatened conduct that will cause us loss or damages, under the usual equity rules, including the applicable rules for obtaining restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.\n27.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIALS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER PARTIES IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\n27.7 MUST BRING CLAIMS WITHIN ONE YEAR.

EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM OF ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER, AND AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM EACH SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY IT.\n27.9 Payment of Legal Fees. You agree to pay us all damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur after the termination or expiration of the franchise granted under this Agreement in: (a) obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation Sections 9 and 17 above); and/or (b) successfully defending a claim from you that we misrepresented the terms of this Agreement, fraudulently induced you to sign this Agreement, that the provisions of this Agreement are not fair, were not properly entered into, and/or that the terms of this Agreement (as it may be amended by its terms) do not exclusively govern the parties' relationship.\n28 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n28.1 Your Investigation of the Franchised Business Possibilities.

Each party represents and warrants to the others that there are no other agreements, court orders, or any other legal obligations that would preclude or in any manner restrict such party from: (a) negotiating and entering into this Agreement; (b) exercising its rights under this Agreement; and/or (c) fulfilling its responsibilities under this Agreement.\n28.7 Your Responsibility for the Choice of the Approved Location. You acknowledge and agree that you have sole and complete responsibility for the choice of the Approved Location; that we have not (and will not be deemed to have, even by our approval of the site that is the Approved Location) given any representation, promise, or guarantee of your success at the Approved Location; and that you will be solely responsible for your own success at the Approved Location.\n28.8 Your Responsibility for Operation of the Franchised Business. Although we retain the right to establish and periodically modify System standards, which you have agreed to maintain in the operation of your Franchised Business, you retain the right and sole responsibility for the day-to-day management and operation of the Franchised Business and the implementation and maintenance of system standards at the Franchised Business.\n28.9 Different Franchise Offerings to Others. You acknowledge and agree that we may modify the terms under which we will offer franchises to other parties in any manner and at any time, which offers and agreements have or may have terms, conditions, and obligations that may differ from the terms, conditions, and obligations in this Agreement.\n28.10 Our Advice.

You acknowledge and agree that the success of the business venture contemplated under this Agreement is speculative and depends, to a large extent, upon your ability as an independent businessperson, your active participation in the daily affairs of the business, market conditions, area competition, availability of product, quality of services provided as well as other factors. We do not make any representation or warranty express or implied as to the potential success of the business venture contemplated hereby.\n28.13 Two or More Signatories.

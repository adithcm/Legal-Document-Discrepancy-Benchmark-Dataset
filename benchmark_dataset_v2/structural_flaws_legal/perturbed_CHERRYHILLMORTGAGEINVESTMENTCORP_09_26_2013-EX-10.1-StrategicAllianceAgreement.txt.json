Each Party agrees to commence any suit, action or proceeding relating hereto only in any Federal court of the United States sitting in New York County in the State of New York or, if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York State court sitting in New York County. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding between any of the Parties arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in (i) any New York State court sitting in New York County, and (ii) any Federal court of the United States sitting in New York County in the State of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party irrevocably agrees to request that the applicable court adjudicate any covered claim on an expedited basis and to cooperate with each other to assure that an expedited resolution of any such dispute is achieved. Each Party irrevocably agrees to abide by the rules or procedure applied by the Federal courts or New York State courts (as the case may be) (including but not limited to procedures for expedited pre-trial discovery) and waive any objection to any such procedure on the ground that such procedure would not be permitted in the courts of some other jurisdiction or would be contrary to the laws of some other jurisdiction. Each Party further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail to such Party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail; provided, that nothing in this Section 6(h) shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.\n\n(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.\n\n(j) FREEDOM MORTGAGE AND CHERRY HILL HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction within the contract. The original text explicitly waives the right to a jury trial. The modified text states that the right to a jury trial may not be waived, directly contradicting the initial waiver. This creates significant uncertainty regarding the enforceability of either provision. The new text directly contradicts the previous sentence, leading to confusion.",

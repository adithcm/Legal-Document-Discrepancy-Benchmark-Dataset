                "original_text": "11.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of Florida, USA,.  The state and federal courts in the jurisdiction in which Palm City, Florida is located shall have non- exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of  adjudicating any controversy or claim between the parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or  nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement, save that the parties agree that any dispute or claim concerning either clause 8  Confidentiality or clause 5 Intellectual Property may be raised in any appropriate jurisdiction where the breach or alleged breach has occurred.",
                "changed_text": "11.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of a jurisdiction to be determined at the time of dispute. The parties may agree to mediate or arbitrate, but no single jurisdiction is pre-selected. The governing law shall be determined by mutual agreement at the time a dispute arises, considering factors such as convenience and the nature of the claim. The parties agree that any dispute or claim concerning either clause 8 Confidentiality or clause 5 Intellectual Property may be raised in any appropriate jurisdiction where the breach or alleged breach has occurred.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies Florida law as governing. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by stating the governing law will be 'determined at the time of the dispute' and that no jurisdiction is pre-selected. This creates a legal contradiction and uncertainty, potentially voiding the governing law provision. Some jurisdictions require clear, upfront specification of governing law.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'warranties may be reinstated' and 'warranties will be discussed' after a broad disclaimer creates a contradiction. While disclaiming warranties, it simultaneously suggests they might be selectively reinstated. This undermines the effectiveness of the disclaimer, making it ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. Some jurisdictions require disclaimers to be clear and unambiguous.",

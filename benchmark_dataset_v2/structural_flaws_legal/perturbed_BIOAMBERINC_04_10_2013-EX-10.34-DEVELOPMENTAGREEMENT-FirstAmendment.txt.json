This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"",
                "changed_text": "13.10 For internal projects only, and with no impact on any third parties, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project; and for the purposes of internal accounting, Bioamber agrees to consider converting the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This consideration will be documented in internal reports.

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding Bioamber's commitment to convert the facilities to CB1. The original text states Bioamber 'agrees to convert', while the modified text replaces this with 'agrees to consider converting', creating a weaker obligation and making it harder to enforce the conversion requirement. The additions of 'internal projects only', 'with no impact on any third parties', and 'internal accounting' moves the clause from a binding obligation to an internal intention.",

                "changed_text": "B. New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   \"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, at their discretion, independent of any agreement to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). The conversion process will be superseded by agreements with third parties, and any economic obligations are subject to future negotiation.

                "explanation": "The replacement of 'agreeing to convert' with 'independent of any agreement to convert' directly contradicts the original intention of the clause, making it less enforceable. The introduction of third-party agreements superseding the conversion process further weakens the commitment. Furthermore, stating that 'economic obligations are subject to future negotiation' removes any concrete financial obligations related to the conversion, rendering the clause largely unenforceable. The change introduces a contradiction regarding the commitment to conversion, casting doubt on the contract's original intent.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens Cargill's commitment. The original text states Cargill 'is willing to allow', implying a firm intention. The modified text changes this to 'may consider allowing', which is far less definitive. Furthermore, replacing 'subject to the following terms and conditions' with 'but under no specific terms and conditions' removes any contractual obligations, reducing the enforceability of any subsequent terms related to these projects. Changing 'agree' to 'acknowledge' further weakens the clause, transitioning the document from a binding agreement to an informal acknowledgement.",

                "explanation": "Relocating the waiver of a jury trial to Section 1.3, which discusses company actions, is misleading because this section is focused on defining the roles of the Buyer Entities with respect to the Company Entities, making it unlikely that parties will look for a critical legal waiver there. By doing that the party might accidentally fail to notice the waiver which can potentially lead to legal disputes.",

                "explanation": "Moving the ownership rights from Section 8.1 and combining with Section 6.3 jumbles up the topic of the sections. One talks about the Quality Control and the other one discusses who has the rights of the intellectual property. Section 8.1 clearly outlines ownership of Arizona Licensed IP, a critical aspect of the agreement, mixing Section 8.1 with 6.3 can muddle the understanding, leading to possible disputes over rights and responsibilities.",

                "original_text": "Governing Law. This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.",
                "changed_text": "Governing Law. This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state where MBE's franchise is located, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The agreement originally specified California law. The change introduces ambiguity and potential conflict if MBE franchises are located in multiple states, making it unclear which state's law applies and more difficult to enforce consistently.  The original intent was for unified contract interpretation.",

The place of arbitration shall be San Diego, California.",
                "changed_text": "Arbitration.\n\n(i)   Every claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the negotiation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement shall be subject to collaborative, good-faith negotiation between the parties. Only in the event that negotiation proves unsuccessful in the sole discretion of both parties may arbitration be pursued. In such instances, any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the negotiation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), or as otherwise agreed by the parties. The place of arbitration shall be San Diego, California.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the arbitration clause by making it contingent upon failed negotiation, and dependent on both parties agreeing to go to arbitration. It introduces a loophole, making arbitration non-mandatory and subject to mutual consent even after negotiation fails. This contradicts the originally intended exclusive arbitration clause and introduces uncertainty in enforcement.",

Neither party shall, for any purpose, be deemed to be an agent of the other party and the relationship between the parties shall only be that of independent contractors.

Neither party shall have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. Initially, the clause strictly defines the relationship as independent contractors, precluding any agency relationship. By adding 'except in cases when MBE is marketing iShip's services, where MBE will be given all authority to create any and all obligations to iShip's name', the agreement now implies that MBE can act as an agent for iShip under certain circumstances. This change directly contradicts the initial statement and can lead to confusion and disputes about the extent of MBE's authority and iShip's liability.",

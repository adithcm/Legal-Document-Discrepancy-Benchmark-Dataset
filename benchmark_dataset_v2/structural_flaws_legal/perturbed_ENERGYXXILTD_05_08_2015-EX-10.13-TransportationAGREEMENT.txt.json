                "original_text": "11.4 Claims. As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within one year and one day after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within one year and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within two years and one day from the date of delivery, or within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter shall not be liable and such claims will not be paid.",
                "changed_text": "16.16 Claims. As a suggestion only, and not creating any obligation on either party, should a party wish to seek recovery for losses or delay to shipments, it is suggested that claims be filed in writing with Transporter within one year and one day after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within one year and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and should that party wish to institute suits arising out of such claims against the Transporter it is suggested that they do so only within two years and one day from the date of delivery, or within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter *may* not be liable and such claims *may* not be paid.",
                "explanation": "Moving the claims requirements from the 'Remedies' section to the 'Miscellaneous' section and changing mandatory language ('must', 'shall') to suggestive language ('should', 'may') reduces its enforceability.

                "explanation": "Moving the governing law and dispute resolution clauses to a section on 'Offshore Platform Facilities and Operating Procedures' makes them less conspicuous.  Furthermore, changing the governing law to Delaware and making several small changes to the legal language such as replacing 'exclusive' with 'appropriate', replacing 'irrevocably submits' with 'submits only', replacing 'shall' with 'may' when refering to waiving trial by jury. This introduces doubt about the intended jurisdiction and applicable law, and also affects the jury waiver clause. Making these clauses uncertain will weaken the legal framework.",

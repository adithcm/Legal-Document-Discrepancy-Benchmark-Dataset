                "explanation": "By adding 'UNLESS SUCH WAIVER IS NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW', this creates a legal contradiction because it first states a waiver and then undermines the waiver contingent on legal permissibility. This introduces ambiguity, potentially weakening the enforceability of the jury trial waiver, particularly under the Seventh Amendment and relevant state laws that govern waivers.",

Financial Assurances shall be limited to a guarantee from the parent company of Shipper in a form and substance acceptable to MPL and sufficient in amount to cover 6-months of Shipper's obligations to MPL so long as the guarantor has sufficient creditworthiness as set forth in this Section; and if not, MPL may then request an irrevocable standby letter of credit in a form and from an issuer acceptable to MPL, and in an amount no greater than 6-months of tolls based on the Quarterly Volume Commitment, plus all applicable taxes.",
                "changed_text": "Financial Information. Shipper shall provide to MPL, at any time: (i) upon MPL's request, information ('Financial Information') that will allow MPL to assess (or reassess) and establish creditworthiness; and (ii) upon MPL's determination of non-creditworthiness, MPL may request, financial assurance in respect of transportation or other services ('Financial Assurances'). Financial Assurances may include a guarantee from any company with assets, and may request an irrevocable standby letter of credit from any issuer, and in any amount. The issuer determining the financial amount.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that financial assurances are based on 'industry standards,' limited to a parent company guarantee if creditworthy, and caps the LOC amount. The modified version removes the 'industry standards,' allows guarantees from 'any company with assets' regardless of actual creditworthiness, removes any cap on the letter of credit, and adds 'The issuer determining the financial amount,' which creates contradiction because the issuer would not be involved in determining what amount is needed.",

                "explanation": "By explicitly stating 'with recourse to any principles of law governing conflicts of law, when applicable,' the modified clause introduces a direct contradiction to the original clause that specifically excludes such recourse. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws will govern the contract, potentially invalidating the choice of law provision. Given that conflicts of law principles determine which jurisdiction's laws apply when there are competing legal systems, this contradiction undermines the predictability and enforceability of the contract.",

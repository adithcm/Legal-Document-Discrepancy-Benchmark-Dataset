                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The terms of this agreement will remain confidential between CELEBRITY and the COMPANY unless written permission is granted for release by both parties.",
                "changed_text": "The terms of this agreement will remain generally confidential between CELEBRITY and the COMPANY; however, the COMPANY reserves the right to disclose specific financial terms of this agreement to potential investors or acquirers without prior written consent from the CELEBRITY.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the confidentiality clause. While initially stating confidentiality, it then allows the COMPANY to disclose financial terms without the CELEBRITY's consent. This contradicts the original strict confidentiality provision and could potentially violate privacy laws depending on the specific financial information disclosed and the jurisdiction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of privacy laws and breach of contract depending on the specifics of the financial terms and jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "Governing Law. This Agreement was negotiated and is being contracted for in Nevada, and shall be governed by the laws of the State of California if the CELEBRITY lives there, but it can be determined otherwise with agreement from both parties.",
                "explanation": "The changed text introduces ambiguity and potential contradiction regarding the governing law. The original text clearly states Nevada law governs, overriding any conflict-of-law provision. The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating California law might apply and introduces a way to change the governing law which could lead to enforceability issues.",

No oral understandings, statements, promises, or inducements contrary to the terms of this Agreement exist. No representations, warranties, covenants, or conditions express or implied, other than as set forth herein, have been made by any party.",

However, certain assurances regarding marketing strategy provided verbally by Jack Zufelt will be considered binding supplements to this agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the entire agreement clause. While initially stating that the written agreement is the complete and only agreement, it then allows for verbal assurances from Jack Zufelt to be considered binding, thereby contradicting the initial statement and opening the door to disputes about what those verbal assurances were.",

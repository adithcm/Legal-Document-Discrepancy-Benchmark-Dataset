Both parties submit to the jurisdiction of the English Courts, provided an alternative legal venue has not been selected at the time of disagreement.",
                "explanation": "The clause originally mandates that the contract is governed and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales, submitting both parties to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts. The alteration introduces uncertainty by allowing both parties to 'mutually agree on an alternative jurisdiction' and states that 'both parties submit to the jurisdiction of the English Courts, provided an alternative legal venue has not been selected at the time of disagreement'. This contradicts the initial, exclusive agreement to English law and jurisdiction, thus introducing a legal contradiction regarding the legal framework applicable to the contract and reduces enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a clear process for termination, requiring six months' notice and specifying conditions under which DCL can terminate. The modification introduces several contradictions. It allows termination 'unless otherwise determined by internal business affairs', creating ambiguity about the initial notice period. It also states that all clauses remain in effect 'except for cases of gross misconduct or termination after mutual agreement', which contradicts the overall continuation of the agreement. Furthermore, stating that 'SEV will not be liable to make those fixes' creates contradiction with the clause, which indicates the necessity to fix it 'prior to the end of this agreement' and charging maintenance charges at 'the discretion of the parties involved', which conflicts with the original clause mandating the rates of the last effective schedule.",

If SEV is insured in respect of such liability, clauses 13.4 and 13.5 do not apply; any further cases will be solved as appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause limits SEV's liability to the annualized value of maintenance charges, with an exception based on insurance coverage. The modification introduces a contradiction by stating 'however, this clause is voided if SEV deems at fault', giving SEV the power to unilaterally negate the liability limit, which is inconsistent and lacks clarity. Additionally, 'If SEV is insured in respect of such liability, clauses 13.4 and 13.5 do not apply; any further cases will be solved as appropriate' introduces an undefined method of 'solving cases', and creates ambiguity as it removes liability.",

In connection with this Agreement, each Party represents, warrants and covenants to the other Party that it has complied and will comply with all Applicable Laws (including Anti-Corruption Laws) and industry codes dealing with government procurement, conflicts of interest, corruption or bribery, including, if applicable, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and any laws enacted to implement the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions.\n\n10.6.2 Prohibited Conduct. In connection with this Agreement, each Party represents, warrants and covenants to the other Party that it has not made, offered, given, promised to give, or authorized, and will not make, offer, give, promise to give, or authorize, any bribe, kickback, payment or transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any person or to any Government Official for the purpose of: (i) improperly influencing any act or decision of the person or Government Official; (ii) inducing the person or Government Official to do or omit to do an act in violation of a lawful or otherwise required duty; (iii) securing any improper advantage; or (iv) inducing the person or Government Official to improperly influence the act or decision of any organization, including any government or government instrumentality, in order to assist such Party in obtaining or retaining business.",

As between the Parties, Aimmune shall own all marketing and sales data and information resulting from its Commercialization of the Product during the Term (the \"Commercialization Data\"), including promotional materials, marketing strategies and market research data.\n\n10.6.1 Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws.

                "explanation": "This change moves the anti-corruption compliance clause to a different part of the \"Commercialization Data\" section, which is completely unrelated. This disrupts the logical flow of legal compliance and places a critical legal declaration within a section concerning marketing data, making it more difficult to locate. It violates the intent of the FCPA by obscuring crucial compliance information.",

                "explanation": "This change removes the clause that the late payment shall not exceed the maximum legal annual interest rate.

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except where such laws conflict with the performance attribution outlined in Exhibit A, in which case, the interpretation of performance attribution shall be at the sole discretion of Federated Advisory Services Company.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating Pennsylvania law governs the contract while simultaneously giving Federated Advisory Services Company the sole discretion to interpret Exhibit A (Performance Attribution), potentially overriding legal interpretations related to performance.",

                "original_text": "FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to records required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the Services performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all times during FASC's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by FASC to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives.",
                "changed_text": "FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records; however, the specifics regarding record maintenance as required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and Rule 31a-2 are subject to the discretion of FASC's internal policies, and access to these records by the Account or its representatives may be limited based on FASC's determination of confidentiality.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause introduces a contradiction. While it initially states FASC will maintain necessary records, it then grants FASC discretion over specific record maintenance rules and limits access to those records. This undermines the original intent of complying with the 1940 Act and provides an avenue for obscuring important financial information.",

However, FASC reserves the right to unilaterally terminate this agreement immediately if the Adviser's Assets under Management fall below a certain, undisclosed threshold, which will be communicated separately.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a unilateral termination clause for FASC based on an undisclosed threshold. This contradicts the original clause that stipulates termination only by mutual agreement or with 60 days' written notice by either party, thus leading to uncertainty.",

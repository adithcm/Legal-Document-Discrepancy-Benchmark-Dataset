The parties shall take appropriate security measures to protect customer nonpublic personal information (\"NPI\"),  as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, Title V, and its implementing regulations, against accidental or unlawful destruction  and unauthorized access, tampering, and copying during storage in either party's computing or paper environment. Access to NPI  must be restricted to only the personnel that have a business need relating to the Renewable Note Program. NPI must be stored in a  secured format within all systems at both parties' location and any other locations where the data may reside. Transmission of such  NPI between the parties or vendors must be done in a secure manner, in a method mutually agreed upon by both parties. Each party will  engage appropriate and industry-standard measures necessary to meet information security guidelines as required by the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act, Title V and its implementing regulations as applicable to such party to effectuate this Agreement. Section 9.07 Choice of Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of a state to be determined by the Contractor, without regard to conflict of law principles.

                "original_text": "XXV.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n       A.   The parties have entered into this Agreement in good faith and in the belief that it is mutually advantageous to them.  It is with that same spirit of cooperation that they pledge to attempt to resolve any dispute amicably without the necessity of litigation.  Accordingly, they agree that except as set forth below, if any dispute arises between them relating to this Agreement that prior to the commencement of any legal action to interpret or enforce this Agreement, they will first use the procedures specified in this Section.",
                "changed_text": "XXIII. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       A.   Our failure to exercise any power reserved to us hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by you with any obligation or condition hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof.  Our waiver of any default by you shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by us and shall not affect or impair our right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature.  The parties have entered into this Agreement in good faith and in the belief that it is mutually advantageous to them.  It is with that same spirit of cooperation that they pledge to attempt to resolve any dispute amicably without the necessity of litigation.  Accordingly, they agree that except as set forth below, if any dispute arises between them relating to this Agreement that prior to the commencement of any legal action to interpret or enforce this Agreement, they will first use the procedures specified in this Section.",
                "explanation": "Moving the 'Dispute Resolution' clause to the 'Miscellaneous' section makes it harder to find and emphasizes that the section is placed where it isn't intuitive or expected, which can reduce its enforceability. This also makes it appear less important than the actual clauses outlining how disputes are solved.",

You will procure at your expense and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement, an insurance policy or policies protecting you, us and our designated affiliates, and their officers, directors, partners and employees against any loss, liability, personal injury, death, or property damage or expense whatsoever arising or occurring upon or in connection with the Franchised Restaurant, as we may reasonably require for our own and your protection.  We will be named an additional insured in such policy or policies.",
                "changed_text": "VIII.       MODIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM\n\n       You acknowledge that from time to time we may change or modify the System presently identified by the Marks, including, without limitation, the adoption and use of new or modified trade names, trademarks, service marks or copyrighted materials, new Menu Items, new products, new equipment or new techniques.  You will accept, use and display for the purpose of this Agreement any such changes in the System, as if they were part of this Agreement at the time of execution. You will make such expenditures as are reasonably required by such changes or modifications in the System.  Except as directed by us, you will not change, modify or alter the System in any way.  You will procure at your expense and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement, an insurance policy or policies protecting you, us and our designated affiliates, and their officers, directors, partners and employees against any loss, liability, personal injury, death, or property damage or expense whatsoever arising or occurring upon or in connection with the Franchised Restaurant, as we may reasonably require for our own and your protection.  We will be named an additional insured in such policy or policies.",
                "explanation": "Placing insurance requirements under 'Modification of the System' is structurally flawed. Insurance is a risk management and liability issue, which is commonly expected in a liability or insurance section. Moving the term out of context also makes the term less enforceable.",

You will pay us without offset, credit or deduction of any nature, so long as this Agreement is in effect, a monthly Continuing Fee equal to five percent (5%) of the Gross Sales derived from the Franchised Restaurant.

We will loan to you during the term of the franchise one (1) copy of our Confidential Operations Manual and other confidential manuals and written materials (all of which are collectively referred to herein as the \"Manuals\") containing reasonable, mandatory and suggested specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us for Buffalo Wild Wings businesses and information relative to your other obligations.  You will not at any time, without our prior written consent, copy, duplicate, record or otherwise reproduce the Manuals in whole or in part or otherwise make the same available to any person.  Any authorized duplication or copying of any of the Manuals shall be performed by us at your expense.  We have the right to add to and otherwise modify, combine, or replace the Manuals from time to time to reflect changes in the specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed by us for Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, provided that no such addition or modification shall alter your fundamental status and rights under this Franchise Agreement. You will pay us without offset, credit or deduction of any nature, so long as this Agreement is in effect, a monthly Continuing Fee equal to five percent (5%) of the Gross Sales derived from the Franchised Restaurant.  The Continuing Fee will be paid monthly in the manner specified below or as otherwise prescribed in the Manuals.",
                "explanation": "The location of the 'Continuing Fee' in the section relating to the 'Confidential Manuals' is a structural flaw. Typically financial terms like fees are expected in sections labeled 'Financials', 'Fees', or 'Payment'. Moving the Continuing Fee makes it difficult for one to understand their obligations and what to expect to pay.",

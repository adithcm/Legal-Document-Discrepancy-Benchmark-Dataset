                "explanation": "Removing the phrase 'that could not adequately be compensated for by monetary award alone' and 'as a matter of right and without the need to prove damage' weakens the enforceability of the remedies. It introduces ambiguity about whether monetary damages would be sufficient and removes the explicit waiver of the need to prove damages for injunctive relief.",

                "explanation": "The alteration introduces a contradiction. Initially, the agreement specifies that it will be exclusively governed by British Columbia law and its courts. However, the added clause allows the parties to choose a different jurisdiction for dispute resolution. This contradicts the exclusivity of the initial clause, potentially leading to confusion and disputes over which jurisdiction's laws should apply.",

No waiver of any provision of this\nAgreement by either of the parties hereto shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, nor\nshall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise clearly provided.",
                "changed_text": "4.5 No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding on any of the\nparties hereto unless consented to in writing by such party. No waiver of any provision of this\nAgreement by either of the parties hereto shall constitute a waiver of any other provision. The parties may verbally agree to waive any provision to this agreement, regardless of anything written to the contrary.",
                "explanation": "The clause initially protects against implied waivers and necessitates written consent. The introduced sentence directly contradicts this by permitting verbal waivers. This contradiction undermines the certainty and enforceability of the written agreement, as verbal agreements are often difficult to prove and can lead to disputes over whether a waiver was actually intended.",

                "explanation": "Relocating the Data Protection clause to the 'Office as a Director' section buries the disclosure within a section about director responsibilities. This makes it less visible and accessible to the Executive, who might not expect to find information about their data protection rights in this section.",

                "explanation": "Moving the grievance and disciplinary procedure under 'Holidays' creates confusion. Employees would not logically look for grievance procedures under holiday entitlements, hindering their ability to understand and exercise their rights.

                "explanation": "By placing the 'Termination of Employment' clause under 'Other Interests', which discusses potential conflicts of interest for the employee, the key information about termination notice periods is less noticeable.

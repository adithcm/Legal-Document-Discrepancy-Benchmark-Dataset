If agreement cannot be reached, an aggrieved Party shall, if he intends to proceed further in terms of Section 21.2 hereof, advise all other Parties in writing that negotiations have failed and that he intends to refer the matter to mediation in terms of Section 21.2.\n21.2 Not earlier than ten (10) working days after having advised the other Party, in terms of Section 21.2, that negotiations in regard to a dispute have failed, an aggrieved Party may require that the dispute be referred, without legal representation, to mediation by a single mediator. The mediator shall be selected by agreement between the Parties. The costs of the mediation shall be borne equally by the Parties.",

The Parties shall negotiate in good faith and make every effort to settle any dispute, or claim, that may arise out of, or relate to, the Agreement.

                "explanation": "Moving the initial section of dispute resolution to the preservation of records section buries dispute resolution terms within a section about record keeping, where it is unlikely to be found by a party reviewing the contract for dispute resolution procedures. This reduces the enforceability and clarity of the dispute resolution process by not placing it in a section where a user would expect to find it.",

The Party requiring referral to arbitration shall notify the other Party, in writing, thereof, not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the mediator has expressed his opinion, failing which the mediator's opinion shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Parties and shall be put into effect. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act No. 42 of 1965, as amended, and in accordance with such procedure as may be agreed by the Parties or, failing such agreement, in accordance with the rules for the Conduct of Arbitrations published by the Association of Arbitrators and current at the date that the arbitrator is appointed. The decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties, shall be carried into immediate effect and, if necessary, be made an order of any court of competent jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Moving the portion of the dispute resolution concerning arbitration to the section on assignment by NVOS makes it difficult to find and obscures its importance. The placement of a critical aspect of conflict resolution within a section dedicated to assignment rights misleads a party reviewing the contract. This reduces the clarity of the dispute resolution process by not placing it in a section where a user would expect to find it, thereby hindering its enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The Indemnification clause is moved to dividend distribution, placing it in an area unexpected for a provision concerning legal protection. This makes the indemnification provision difficult to discover and its relevance unclear to a party assessing liability or legal rights. The altered arrangement reduces the clarity and ease of access to the indemnification terms by locating them outside of the standard section for indemnification, thereby diminishing its enforceability.",

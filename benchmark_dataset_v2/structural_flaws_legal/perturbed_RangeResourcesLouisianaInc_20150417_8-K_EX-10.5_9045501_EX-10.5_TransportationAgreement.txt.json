                "explanation": "Relocating the jury trial waiver to a general provision buries it and reduces its prominence, thereby decreasing the likelihood that it will be noticed and understood. The altered clause diminishes its clarity and enforceability due to its less prominent placement and ambiguous language.",

",
                "explanation": "This alteration adds a temporal constraint to the notice requirements, mandating a weekly cadence of communication regardless of relevance or need. This stipulation muddies the clause and creates uncertainty regarding the validity and timeliness of essential notices, potentially undermining the enforceability of the entire contract.",

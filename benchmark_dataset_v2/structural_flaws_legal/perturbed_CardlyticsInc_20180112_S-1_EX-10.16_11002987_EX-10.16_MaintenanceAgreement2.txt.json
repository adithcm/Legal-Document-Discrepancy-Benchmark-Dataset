                "original_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule and shall receive a refund of all amounts previously paid hereunder.",
                "changed_text": "If the proposed price Is Increased by Supplier upon delivery to Bank of America of detailed specifications or at any other time hereafter, Bank of America may terminate this Schedule; however, refunds will be issued based on supplier's discretion and a payment schedule will be determined by mutual consent within 90 days.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants Bank of America an immediate refund if the price increases. The modification adds a clause suggesting refunds are discretionary and introduces a potentially lengthy negotiation period, contradicting the original clear right to a refund and hindering its enforceability. The added payment schedule introduces further ambiguity.",

                "explanation": "By allowing Bank of America to selectively accept terms and conditions, it undermines the original clause which states the terms are binding and subject to the agreement. This reduces clarity about which conditions are binding to each party.",

                "explanation": "Moving the 'No Consequential Damages and Limitation of Liability' clause to the 'Performance' section diminishes its prominence and clarity.

                "explanation": "Moving the Intellectual Property Indemnity clause to an intentionally omitted and unspecified section like '3.8 [* * *]' creates significant ambiguity and obfuscation.

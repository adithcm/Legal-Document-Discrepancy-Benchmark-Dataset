NETTAXI  DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES, WILL MEET SPINRECORDS.COM'S OR ANY END USERS NEEDS OR BE FREE FROM ERRORS,  OR  THAT  THE  OPERATION  OF  ITS  WEB PAGES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. THE FOREGOING  EXCLUSIONS  AND  DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.",

NETTAXI warrants its services, furnished as a result of or under this agreement, will achieve the intended purpose and be free from errors.

Disclaimer of any implied warranties, quality, performance, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or fitness for a particular purpose.",
                "explanation": "By placing a Disclaimer of Warranty in Section 9 as clause 9.14 instead of its original location in section 5.3, it undermines the effectiveness of the disclosure. The original clause 5.3 clearly states an 'AS IS' basis without any warranties. The modified text implies NETTAXI provides a functional service and warrants it will achieve its intended purpose.",
                "contradicted_law": "The modifications impact contract law principles relating to warranty disclaimers, potentially conflicting with Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provisions (if applicable), which require conspicuous and unambiguous language for disclaimers.",

Unless waived by NETTAXI (which it may  do  in  its  sole  discretion)  the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action  with  respect  to  the  subject  matter  of  this Agreement shall be the Superior  Court of California for the County of Santa Clara or the United States District  Court  for the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the  purpose  of  any  such  action.  The  parties  specifically disclaim the UN Convention  on  Contracts  for  the  International  Sale  of  Goods.",

The parties specifically agree that the location of the jurisdiction may change at any time during the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits assignment without prior written consent. The modified text allows NETTAXI to freely assign the agreement in cases of company restructure, which contradicts the need for written consent. NETTAXI now may take control of the entire contract.",

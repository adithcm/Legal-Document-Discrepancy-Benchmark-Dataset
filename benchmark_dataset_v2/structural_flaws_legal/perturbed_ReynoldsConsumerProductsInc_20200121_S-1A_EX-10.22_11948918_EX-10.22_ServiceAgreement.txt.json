Each of the Parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Lake County, Illinois, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees to bring all claims under any theory of liability in respect of such action or proceeding exclusively in any such court and agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Each Party hereto agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.5. Nothing in this Section 10.8, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each Party hereto agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Illinois law and jurisdiction. The added sentence introduces a contradiction by allowing parties to mutually agree on a different jurisdiction, undermining the initial exclusivity of Illinois law and jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The original assignment clause allows for assignment under specific conditions without consent.

ARBITRATION\n\nAny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any agreements or instruments relating hereto or delivered in connection herewith or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicablility of this agreement to arbitrate, will at the request of any party be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles, California before three (3) arbitrators under the rules of the JAMS. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief in pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration.",

FURTHER ACTION\n\nEach of COMPANY and CONTENT PROVIDER agrees to execute and deliver such other documents or agreements and take such other action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for the implementation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any agreements or instruments relating hereto or delivered in connection herewith or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicablility of this agreement to arbitrate, will at the request of any party be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles, California before three (3) arbitrators under the rules of the JAMS. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief in pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration.",
                "explanation": "Moving the arbitration clause to the 'Further Action' section makes it less conspicuous and harder to find, potentially undermining its enforceability. Arbitration clauses are typically expected to be in a dispute resolution section, not a section about executing further documents. This relocation creates a structural flaw by obscuring a critical legal provision.",

TH  LIABILITY OF CONTENT PROVIDER FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT\nOR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND SHALL NOT EXCEED $31,200.00, unless the Content Provider had prior knowledge of potential harm, in which case liability is unlimited.",
                "explanation": "Adding the phrase 'unless the Content Provider had prior knowledge of potential harm, in which case liability is unlimited' creates a contradiction within the limitation of liability clause. The clause initially limits liability to a specific amount, but the added exception introduces ambiguity and the possibility of unlimited liability, undermining the purpose of the original limitation. This could lead to disputes over the interpretation and enforceability of the clause.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be deemed given on the date of actual receipt or delivery' to 'shall be deemed given on the date of sending' removes the verifiable element of receipt.

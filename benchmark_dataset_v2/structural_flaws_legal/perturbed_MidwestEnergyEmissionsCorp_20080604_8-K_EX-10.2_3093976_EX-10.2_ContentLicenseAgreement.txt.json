ARBITRATION Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any agreements or instruments relating hereto or delivered in connection herewith or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicablility of this agreement to arbitrate, will at the request of any party be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles, California before three (3) arbitrators under the rules of the JAMS. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief in pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration.",
                "changed_text": "11. CONFIDENTIALITY ... G. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, neither party will make any public statement, press release or other announcement relating to the terms of or existence of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n16. ARBITRATION Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles, California. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief in pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement will at the request of only one party be determined by arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause is moved to a section on Confidentiality, where it is less likely to be noticed. This obfuscates the dispute resolution process, potentially violating requirements for clear and conspicuous arbitration agreements. In addition to moving it, the language was weakened to imply that arbitration is optional and requires only one party's request.",

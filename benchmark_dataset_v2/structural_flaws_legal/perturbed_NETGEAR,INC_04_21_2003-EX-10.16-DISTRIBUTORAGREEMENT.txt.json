NETGEAR has no liability to Distributor under this section entitled CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT with respect to any claim which is based upon or results from (i) the combination of any Product with any equipment, device, firmware or software not furnished by NETGEAR, or (ii) any modification of any Product by a party other than NETGEAR. (iii) Distributor's failure to install or have installed changes, revisions or updates as instructed by NETGEAR, or (iv) NETGEAR's compliance with Distributor's or end-user's specifications, designs or instructions.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless mutually agreed in writing' to the Limitations clause introduces a contradiction. The original clause establishes clear limitations on NETGEAR's liability, while the added phrase allows for exceptions based on mutual agreement. This undermines the defined limitations, creating ambiguity and potential disputes over liability.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'provided it does not exceed $100' after setting up conditions introduces a contradiction. The original clause establishes clear conditions for NETGEAR's agreement to defend liability claims, while the added phrase creates a contradiction by allowing exceptions based on maximum limits and potential disputes over liability.

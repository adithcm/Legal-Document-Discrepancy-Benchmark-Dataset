                "original_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid for 30 days are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Service.",
                "changed_text": "Amounts which remain unpaid for 30 days are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, however if the customer complains, this charge can be waived. Amounts which remain unpaid for 30 days are subject to all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Service.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity and weakens the enforceability of the finance charge. Adding 'however if the customer complains, this charge can be waived', introduces a contradiction. The original clause clearly states a 1.5% finance charge, while the modified clause provides an ambiguous and subjective option for waiving the charge, which can be argued as unenforceable due to lack of clear terms.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'provided that, such enforceability shall be limited only to the extent that the Customer feels is fair and reasonable' introduces a subjective element that undermines the binding nature of the agreement. This caveat effectively allows the customer to unilaterally decide the extent to which the agreement is enforceable, creating a significant legal contradiction. The standard contract law requires mutual agreement and obligations.",

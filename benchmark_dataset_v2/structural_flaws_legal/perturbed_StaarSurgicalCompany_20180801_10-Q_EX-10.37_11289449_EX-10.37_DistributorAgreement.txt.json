                "original_text": "25. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution\n25.1 This Agreement, which is in English, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. The parties hereby expressly disclaim and exclude any applicable provisions of the United Nations Convention for the International Sales of Goods.\n25.2 The parties waive their rights to seek remedies in court (except where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief), including any right to a jury trial. Except in a case where the relief sought is an injunction or other equitable relief, the parties agree that any dispute between the parties arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, whether characterized or sounding in contract or tort or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California, USA. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own expenses of the arbitration, but the arbitration fees and costs shall be borne equally between the parties participating in the arbitration. Disputes shall not be resolved in any other forum or venue.",

Force Majeure\nPerformance of the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder shall be subject to force majeure and acts of God, including but not limited to insurrections, riots, wars and war-like operations, terrorist acts, explosions, governmental acts, epidemics, failure of contractors to perform, strikes, fires, accidents, acts of any public enemy, inability to obtain required materials, supplies, products or qualified labor, delay in transportation and any applicable law, regulation or restriction of any foreign, federal, state or local governmental entity or instrumentality. However, the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid, remove or cure said circumstances. Any party temporarily excused for performances hereunder by any such circumstance shall resume performance with utmost dispatch when such circumstances are removed or cured. Any party claiming such circumstances as an excuse for delay in performance shall give prompt notice in writing thereof to the other party. Nothing herein and no contrary provisions of any law, regulation, or governmental pronouncement shall, however, relieve Distributor of its obligation to make the payments to STAAR required hereunder at the times and in the manner herein specified.\n\n25.2 The parties agree that any dispute between the parties arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, whether characterized or sounding in contract or tort or otherwise, shall be resolved through a method agreed to by the parties at the time a dispute arises. Each party shall bear its own expenses of the dispute resolution, but the dispute resolution fees and costs shall be borne equally between the parties participating in the dispute resolution. Disputes shall not be resolved in any other forum or venue.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause (25.2) is moved to be part of Section 21, force majeure clause, which is completely unrelated, and the section 25 is modified as a whole. Now, it lacks clear instruction, and requires the method agreed to by the parties at the time a dispute arises, making it difficult to enforce. Additionally, the removal of the reference to the International Chamber of Commerce rules reduces enforceability, and the mention of waiving rights to court remedies is removed.",

                "original_text": "10. Regulatory and Post-Market Surveillance Requirements\n10.1 During the term of this Agreement and for at least ten (10) years thereafter, Distributor shall maintain records to allow for traceability of individual serial/lot numbers to customers for all sales of the Products. Upon request by STAAR, Distributor shall supply STAAR with a report of the information contained in such records.\n10.2 In the event that STAAR deems it necessary to recall any Product, or any governmental authority requests recall of any Product distributed or sold by Distributor in the Territory, Distributor and STAAR shall cooperate fully with each other in effecting such recall, with an effort to reduce as much as possible the expense thereof and Distributor must notify STAAR of any contemplated or requested recalls as soon as possible (and at all times within any period required to notify any regulatory authority under applicable law) and prior to Distributor taking any steps to effect such a recall. Without limiting Distributor's obligations under law, as between Distributor and STAAR, the decision of whether or not to recall any Product shall be made solely by STAAR. Distributor shall notify all customers who received the recalled Product and shall record all receipts of Product returned under any recall. Distributor shall maintain copies of recall notification letters and maintain distribution logs that detail where each Product was shipped by Distributor.\n10.3 Distributor shall fully document and inform STAAR in writing of any Complaints or other matters addressed in this Section 10. Documentation with respect to Complaints shall include the Product model and serial or lot number, customer contact information, and as much detail as possible regarding the nature of the Complaint. Distributor will forward to STAAR any Complaint involving significant bodily injury, illness or death resulting from use of Products within one (1) calendar day of receipt and Distributor must notify STAAR of any such incident prior to issuing any notice required by law in respect of such incident (including those to be issued to governmental or regulatory authorities). Distributor shall forward to STAAR all other Complaints within five (5) calendar days of receipt. If any evaluation of Product involved in a Complaint by STAAR is necessary or appropriate, Distributor will use best efforts to retrieve the affected Product, if available, and return it to STAAR. STAAR will pay for the return shipment of such Product to STAAR. STAAR will be responsible for investigating all Complaints, determining if reporting to regulatory authorities in the Territory is required, and submitting such reports to regulatory authorities when required. The term \"Complaints\" as used in this Section 10.3 means any report, complaint or other communication received by Distributor (or its employees, contractors, agents or representatives) from end users of Products or their healthcare providers related to the safety or efficacy of the Products.\n10.4 STAAR informs Distributor that Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 above are requirements of the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), and that non-compliance by Distributor of these Sections will constitute grounds for STAAR to immediately cease supply of Products to Distributor and will be deemed a failure by Distributor to perform a material obligation, warranty, duty or responsibility hereunder.\n10.5 Distributor acknowledges and agrees that it has full understanding of and shall duly observe and abide by any and all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the import, commercialization, marketing, distribution or sale of Products in the Territory (collectively, \"Regulatory Requirements\"). Distributor further acknowledges and agrees that STAAR does not take any, and shall not be responsible for, any legal liability or responsibility for damages, costs or legal consequences that may result from any failure by Distributor to observe or comply with any Regulatory Requirements.\n10.6 Distributor shall observe all transport and storage requirements and conditions applicable to the Products as indicated on any Product packaging.",

Regulatory and Post-Market Surveillance Requirements\n10.5 Distributor acknowledges and agrees that it has a basic understanding of and shall try to observe the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the import, commercialization, marketing, distribution or sale of Products in the Territory (collectively, \"Regulatory Requirements\"). Distributor further acknowledges and agrees that STAAR does not take any legal liability or responsibility for damages, costs or legal consequences that may result from a failure by Distributor to comply with any Regulatory Requirements.\n10.6 Distributor will observe all transport and storage requirements and conditions applicable to the Products as indicated on any Product packaging.",
                "explanation": "Sections 10.1-10.4 are removed and 10.5 is weakened by changing \"full understanding\" to \"basic understanding\" and \"duly observe and abide by\" to \"shall try to observe\". This reduces distributor's clear obligations regarding record-keeping, recalls, complaint handling, and compliance with the Medical Device Directive, making it harder to enforce these requirements. This also obscures the legal basis for STAAR ceasing supply for non-compliance.",

Specifically, Distributor shall not (a) violate any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws; or (b) offer, pay or promise to pay, give or promise to give, or authorize the payment or giving of, anything of value to any official representative of any Governmental Entity or authority or any political party or officer thereof or any candidate for office in any jurisdiction (individually and collectively, a \"Government Official\"), (i) for the purpose of (A) influencing any act or decision of such Government Official in his official capacity, (B) inducing such Government Official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty, (C) securing any improper advantage, or (iv) inducing such Government Official to influence or affect any act or decision of any Government Entity, or (ii) in order to assist Distributor in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to Distributor or any of its affiliates. The term \"Governmental Entity\" as used in this Section 15.2 means any government or any department, agency or instrumentality thereof, including any entity or enterprise owned or controlled by a government, or a public international organization. Distributor shall maintain for at least two (2) years and make readily available to STAAR or its duly authorized representatives' books, records and accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that accurately and completely reflect the nature of every transaction related to the sale of the Products.",
                "changed_text": "2. Business of Distributor\nDistributor is and shall remain an independent contractor. Distributor agrees that STAAR has granted it no authority to act or make any representations or warranties on behalf of STAAR. Distributor is at all times acting for its own account, and at its own expense. Distributor represents to STAAR that Distributor has trained and experienced personnel, facilities and other resources in the Territory in order to diligently, professionally and effectively market, distribute and sell the Products. Distributor shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and treaties relating to the marketing, distribution and sale of the Products and the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder. Distributor shall be free to establish its own pricing for Products sold by Distributor and shall notify STAAR of its pricing, as in effect from time to time.\n\n15.2 Distributor represents that they will try to act in compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Distributor is not expected to review their books, records and accounts.",
                "explanation": "Moving the FCPA compliance clause (15.2) from a dedicated section to an early section titled 'Business of Distributor' which generally discusses the contractor's independence and high-level responsibilities dilutes its significance. Then, removing the detail and simply stating the distributor 'will try to act in compliance' dramatically weakens the requirement and places a higher burden of proof on Staar",

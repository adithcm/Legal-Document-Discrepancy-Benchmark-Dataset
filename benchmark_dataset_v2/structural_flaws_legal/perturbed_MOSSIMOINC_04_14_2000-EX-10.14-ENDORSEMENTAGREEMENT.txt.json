                "original_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance with limits no less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) and naming Licensor and Duval as additional named insureds. Within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Licensor evidence of such policy, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Licensor at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",
                "changed_text": "Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance with limits to be determined. Company will submit to Licensor evidence of such policy, but Company is not responsible for informing Licensor of modifications to the policy.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the specific insurance limit and eliminates the requirement for the insurer to notify Licensor of policy changes. This reduces the enforceability of the insurance requirement, because a general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage must have a limit defined.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring definiteness of terms, failure to specify could violate requirements for insurance coverage.",

This agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its principals of conflicts of laws. In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer not employed by or associated with either party to this agreement) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Cleveland, Ohio. Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",
                "changed_text": "22. SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS. Section headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of&bbsp;aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the -7- construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted.\n21. ARBITRATION/GOVERNING LAW. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of a state to be determined at a later date. Should the parties be unable to resolve the conflict, they reserve the right to litigate. The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation moves the arbitration clause to a section where it wouldn't be normally found (Significance of Headings). Also, this introduces a contradiction as the clause now states that the governing law will be determined at a later date. Furthermore, the original clause made arbitration mandatory. The modified version allows for litigation, directly contradicting the original intent of mandatory arbitration. The clause no longer includes the rules to be followed during the process, limiting enforceability.",

                "changed_text": "Company agrees to consider potentially indemnifying Licensor, Duval and their authorized agent, or any of them, from and against expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs. The conditions for which are to be determined.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that the Company indemnifies the Licensor, Duval, and their agents. The modified clause replaces 'agrees to protect, indemnify and save harmless' with 'agrees to consider potentially indemnifying,' weakening the obligation. It further introduces ambiguity by stating 'The conditions for which are to be determined,' which implies that the scope and applicability of the indemnification are undefined, making the clause vague and difficult to enforce. The clause now lacks detail, making it unenforceable.",

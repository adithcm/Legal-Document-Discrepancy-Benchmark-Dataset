This agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its principals of conflicts of laws. In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer not employed by or associated with either party to this agreement) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Cleveland, Ohio. Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.",

In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who may or may not be a lawyer employed by or associated with either party to this agreement) in accordance with rules determined at the time of the dispute.

The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding if both parties agree to it.",
                "explanation": "The arbitration clause is weakened by changing the requirements for the arbitrator, the location of arbitration, and the binding nature of the decision, introducing ambiguity and reducing the enforceability of mandatory arbitration. It introduces elements of ambiguity and mutual agreement that undermine the original intent of a clear, binding arbitration process. ",

                "explanation": "The change removes the specific liability insurance limit of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000), which introduces ambiguity and vagueness regarding the extent of coverage required. The original clause demanded explicit notice at least twenty days in advance, this has now been moved to 'providing notice of modification,' which weakens the protection for Licensor and Duval. This may make it more difficult for Licensor/Duval to claim complete compensation.",

A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within thirty (30) days of the full execution of this Agreement.

Removing both the expense of the insurance, the required limit, Duval as an insured, and requiring twenty days notice reduces both clarity and enforceability. By stating 'Company shall provide,' it leaves who will cover the expense of coverage unstated. ",

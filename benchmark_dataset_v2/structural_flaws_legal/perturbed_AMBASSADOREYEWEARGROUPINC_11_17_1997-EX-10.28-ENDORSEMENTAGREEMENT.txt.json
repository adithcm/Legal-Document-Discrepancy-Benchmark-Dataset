Indemnification by Licensee and Product Liability Insurance.\n\n            Diplomat hereby indemnifies KI, Inc. and KI, undertakes to defend KI, Inc. and KI against, and hold KI, Inc. and KI harmless from, any claims, suits, loss and damage (including attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of (a) any allegedly unauthorized use of any patent, process, idea, method, or device by Diplomat in connection with the products covered by this Agreement, (b) any alleged defects in the products covered by this Agreement, and (c) any other alleged action by Diplomat. Diplomat agrees that it will obtain, at its own expense, product liability insurance from a recognized insurance company which is qualified to do business in the State of California providing adequate protection (at least in the amount of $         ) for KI, Inc., KI and Diplomat against any claims, suits, loss or damage arising out of any alleged defects in the products. As proof of such insurance, a fully paid certificate of insurance naming KI, Inc. and KI as an insured party will be submitted to KI, Inc. by Diplomat for KI, Inc.'s prior approval before any product is distributed or sold, and at the latest within thirty (30) days after the date first written above. Any proposed change in certificates of insurance shall be submitted to KI, Inc. for its prior approval. KI, Inc. shall be entitled to a copy of the\n\nthen prevailing certificate of insurance, which shall be furnished KI, Inc. by Diplomat. As used in the first 2 sentences of this paragraph 6, \"KI, Inc.\" shall also include the officers, directors, agents, and employees of the KI, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.",

Promotional Material.\n\n                  (a) In all cases where Diplomat desires artwork to be created       involving products that are the subject of this license, the cost of such       artwork and the time for the production thereof shall be borne by       Diplomat. All artwork and designs involving KI's name, or any reproduction       thereof, shall, notwithstanding their invention or use by Diplomat, be and       remain the\n\nproperty of SW, and SW shall be entitled to use the same and to license       the use of the same by others.\n\n                  (b) KI, Inc. shall have the right, but shall not be under any obligation, to use KI's name and/or the name of Diplomat so as to give KI's name, KI, Inc., or KI, Inc.'s programs full and favorable prominence and publicity. KI, Inc. shall not be under any obligation whatsoever to use KI's name, or any person, character, symbol, design, likeness, or visual representation thereof in any radio or television program.\n\nDiplomat hereby agrees to obtain product liability insurance from a recognized insurance company which is qualified to do business in the State of California providing adequate protection (at least in the amount of $ ) for KI, Inc., KI and Diplomat against any claims, suits, loss or damage arising out of any alleged defects in the products. As proof of such insurance, a fully paid certificate of insurance naming KI, Inc. and KI as an insured party will be submitted to KI, Inc. by Diplomat for KI, Inc.'s prior approval before any product is distributed or sold, and at the latest within thirty (30) days after the date first written above.

KI, Inc. shall be entitled to a copy of the then prevailing certificate of insurance, which shall be furnished KI, Inc. by Diplomat.\n\n                  (c) Diplomat agrees not to offer for sale, advertise, or       publicize any of the products licensed hereunder on radio or television       without the prior written approval of KI, Inc., which approval KI, Inc.       may grant or withhold in its unfettered discretion.",
                "explanation": "The requirement for Diplomat to obtain product liability insurance is moved to the section on promotional material. This is an irrelevant section for insurance requirements, making it less likely to be noticed and enforced. The original section, 'Indemnification by Licensee and Product Liability Insurance', is meant to clearly state the responsibilities and protections related to liability, but moving the insurance requirement makes it unclear if the parties intended to follow through. Furthermore, this is in a contract involving parties in California, so having adequate product liability insurance is important.",

KI, Inc. and its duly-authorized representatives shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable hours of the day, to visit the offices of Diplomat one time each calendar quarter for the purpose of examining said books of account and records, and all other documents and materials in the possession or under the control of Diplomat, with respect to the subject matter and terms of this Agreement, and shall have free and full access thereto for said purposes and for the purpose of making extracts therefrom. Upon demand of KI, Inc., Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. a detailed statement by an independent certified public accountant showing the number, description, gross sales price, itemized deductions from gross sales price and net sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat to the date of KI, Inc.'s demand. The cost of preparing such statement shall be borne by KI, Inc. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the prepared statement indicates that KI, Inc., received less than all royalties payable to it under this Agreement, and the differential between the royalties received and those payable amounts to more than  % of the royalties received, then the cost of such statement shall be borne by Diplomat. In the event books of account and records shall be kept available for at least two (2) years after the termination of this license.",

KI will make one (1) personal appearance per License Year during the period of this Agreement on behalf of Diplomat at the Vision Expo in New York, New York, subject to the terms of this paragraph. Such appearance shall be for the purpose of signing autographs, shall last for a period of up to three (3) hours, and shall be subject to KI's schedule and availability. Diplomat, at its own expense, shall provide KI with a hair and make-up assistant of KI's choosing for each personal or media appearance required under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The clause regarding the maintenance of records and the right of KI, Inc. to audit those records is moved to the section describing KI's personal endorsement and appearances. This is an unlikely place to find financial audit rights, thus reducing its enforceability. A party isn't likely to check there to see those obligations written in the contract.",

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent KI, Inc. from granting any other licenses for the use of KI's name or likeness, or from utilizing KI's name and likeness in any manner whatsoever, except that KI, Inc. agrees that except as provided herein it will grant no other licenses for the territory to which this license extends for the use of KI's name and likeness in connection with the sale of the products described in subparagraphs 2.(a)(1) and (2) of this Agreement effective during the term of this Agreement.\n\nNone of the terms of this Agreement can be waived or modified except by an express Agreement in writing signed by both parties.

                "explanation": "The 'No Waiver' clause, which typically clarifies that inaction does not constitute a relinquishment of rights, is moved to the 'Exclusivity' section. This placement obscures its general applicability, making it appear related only to the exclusivity terms of the agreement. This may weaken its effectiveness in preventing implied waivers regarding other aspects of the contract. It is expected a section of 'No Waiver' to be a section by itself.",

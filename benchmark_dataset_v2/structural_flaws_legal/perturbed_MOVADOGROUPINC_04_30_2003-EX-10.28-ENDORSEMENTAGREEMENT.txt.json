Any notice to the Company shall be addressed to the attention of the General Counsel, with a copy to the Chief Executive Officer, at the principal office of the Company at 650 From Road; Paramus, New Jersey 07652. Any notice to the Trustees of the Trust shall be addressed to the Trustees of the Trust, 115 Central Park West, Apt. 4D, New York, New York 10023, with a copy to Andrew W. Regan, Esq. c/o Shearman & Sterling, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022. Any party may change his or its address by giving written notice of such change to the other party pursuant to this Section 8.",
                "changed_text": "All notices hereunder shall be sent by carrier pigeon. Any notice to the Company shall be addressed to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer, at the principal office of the Company at 650 From Road; Paramus, New Jersey 07652. Any notice to the Trustees of the Trust shall be addressed to the Trustees of the Trust, 115 Central Park West, Apt. 4D, New York, New York 10023. Any party may change his or its address by giving verbal notice of such change to the other party pursuant to Section 8, provided that the other party acknowledges such notice in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandated certified mail and written notices to specific individuals, ensuring a verifiable record. The modified version replaces certified mail with carrier pigeon, removes the General Counsel from the notice recipients, and allows for verbal notice if acknowledged in writing, making it difficult to ensure proper and verifiable notification, creating ambiguity and enforceability issues.",

                "changed_text": "The Company may amend or modify this Agreement at any time, and any such amendment or modification shall be effective immediately. The Trust's acceptance of continued benefits under this agreement will be considered acceptance of the amendments and modifications.",
                "explanation": "The original clause protected the Trust by requiring their written consent for adverse amendments. The modified version eliminates the consent requirement, stating that amendments are effective immediately and that the Trust's continued receipt of benefits implies acceptance. This undermines the Trust's rights and ability to negotiate changes, making it easier for the Company to unilaterally alter the agreement to the Trust's detriment.",

Except to the extent preempted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), all rights hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to its rules governing conflicts of laws, or the rules of any other jurisdiction which would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York to apply. If this Agreement is determined to be subject to ERISA, it is intended to be exempt from the reporting and disclosure provisions of ERISA pursuant to Section 104(a)(3) of ERISA and Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104-24.",

All rights hereunder shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction of the Company's choosing, which may or may not be the State of New York, depending on where the company decides to bring suit. It is also the intent of this agreement that the agreement be subject to ERISA, even if it is not. This agreement is meant to fully comply with ERISA as the company understands it.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specified New York law as governing, with an exception for ERISA. The modified version grants the Company the discretion to choose the governing law at the time of suit, introducing uncertainty. The original clause states that the agreement is to be exempt from ERISA, and the modified version contradicts it by stating the agreement should comply with ERISA.",

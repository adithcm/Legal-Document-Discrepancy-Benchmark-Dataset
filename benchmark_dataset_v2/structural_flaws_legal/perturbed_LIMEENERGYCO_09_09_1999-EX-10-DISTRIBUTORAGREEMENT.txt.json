                "changed_text": "5.8.     Nonpublic Information. The Distributor acknowledges that is it                   aware that the  securities  laws  prohibit  any person who has                   material, non-public information concerning the Company or the                   matters  which  are  the  subject  of  this   Agreement   from                   purchasing  or selling  securities of the Company (or options,                   warrants and rights relating  thereto) and from  communicating                   such  information to any other person under  circumstances  in                   which it is reasonably  foreseeable that such person is likely                   to purchase or sell such securities.\n\n6.9      Governing Law.  This Agreement is to be construed according to the laws          of the State of Delaware.",
                "explanation": "The governing law clause, which specifies that the contract is construed under Illinois law, is moved to a section about nonpublic information and changed to Delaware law. Placing this in an irrelevant section and changing the state reduces the clarity of which state law governs the contract and makes it more difficult to enforce. The change to Delaware law introduces a legal contradiction.",

Company shall at all times make reasonable  efforts to maintain quality control and to deliver Products to Distributor which, when received by Distributor, or, as the case may be, the end-user, are properly and adequately packaged and contained, fully assembled (except for miscellaneous components which may be shipped separately to prevent damage in transit), fully functional and otherwise in conformance with the warranties set forth herein.  Company warrants that the Products will be designed, manufactured, constructed, assembled and packaged in a workmanlike manner and that such Products shall be fully functional and fit for their intended purposes. Company further warrants that the Products sold hereunder shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of twenty-four (24) months after delivery to Distributor's end-user. The Company shall only be liable for defective Products if written approval is made.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the sentence that the Company shall not be liable for defective products, except as provided in this agreement. It then adds that the Company will only be liable for defective Products if written approval is made, which is added to the warranty section and introduces an unexplicit requirement, making it harder for the consumer to demonstrate the existing defect. This creates a legal contradiction.",

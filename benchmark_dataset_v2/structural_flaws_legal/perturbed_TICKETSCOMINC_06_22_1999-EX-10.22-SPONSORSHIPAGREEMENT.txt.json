                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, to the extent allowed by law.",
                "changed_text": "Any late payments under this Agreement will be assessed a service fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, but the applicability of this fee may be waived at MP3.com's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'but the applicability of this fee may be waived at MP3.com's sole discretion' contradicts the original clause. While the original clause establishes a clear late payment fee, the added phrase introduces ambiguity and gives MP3.com the option to negate the fee, potentially violating financial disclosure regulations by making the fee non-mandatory. The change makes the financial terms unclear.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Truth in Lending Act (TILA) principles or similar regulations requiring clear disclosure of financial terms.",

Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Diego County, California, and each party hereby consent to the jurisdiction thereof.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California; however, the venue for any disputes may be subject to negotiation between the parties at the time the dispute arises.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states that California law governs and any claims must be brought in San Diego County courts. The added phrase, 'however, the venue for any disputes may be subject to negotiation between the parties at the time the dispute arises,' directly contradicts this. It introduces uncertainty regarding the legal jurisdiction and venue, making the clause unenforceable. This contradicts the original clause's intent of establishing a clear legal framework.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles requiring clear jurisdiction and venue clauses.",

                "changed_text": "Tickets may terminate this Agreement; however, they must provide reasonable rationale prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days subsequent to the Effective Date.",
                "explanation": "The changed clause replaces the original agreement's 'any reason' justification with the condition that 'reasonable rationale' is required. This change adds a contradiction that was not originally in place, opening the door to disputes as to what is and is not considered a 'reasonable rationale' for the termination of the agreement.",

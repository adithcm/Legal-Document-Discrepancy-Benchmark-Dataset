EACH PARTY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT         TO THE OTHER PARTY'S ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.",

EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO         TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,         ANY CREDIT SUPPORT DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY, OR ANY TRANSACTION.

                "explanation": "The jury trial waiver, which should be prominently displayed and easily found, has been moved to a less relevant section (Event of Default) making it harder for a party to locate and acknowledge. This obfuscation undermines the clear and conspicuous requirement often associated with such waivers to ensure informed consent.",

However, the parties can mutually agree to a different state's laws for specific disputes.",
                "explanation": "Adding 'However, the parties can mutually agree to a different state's laws for specific disputes' after explicitly stating New York law governs introduces a contradiction. It creates ambiguity regarding which law actually applies, making enforcement unpredictable. This could lead to legal challenges based on which jurisdiction's law should be applied.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'However, the Counterparty maintains the option to pursue additional claims against the Trust Estate' directly contradicts the original non-recourse clause. The original clause states that claims are extinguished if the Trust Estate is insufficient. The added sentence re-introduces the possibility of further claims, creating a legal contradiction that makes the extent of the Counterparty's recourse unclear.",

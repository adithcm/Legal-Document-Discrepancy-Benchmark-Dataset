                "explanation": "The jury waiver clause, normally found within the 'Governing Law' or 'Dispute Resolution' section, has been moved to the 'Independent Contractor' clause. This relocation obscures the clause's importance and enforceability, making it less likely to be noticed and understood by a party signing the contract. This is a legal contradiction because jury waivers must be conspicuous and knowingly made.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty clause is placed next to the Disclaimer. However, I added the disclaimer language next to it, making it so it is difficult to follow the original warranty. This is a legal contradiction because the warranty is weakened by this, which makes it contradictory to the intended purpose.",

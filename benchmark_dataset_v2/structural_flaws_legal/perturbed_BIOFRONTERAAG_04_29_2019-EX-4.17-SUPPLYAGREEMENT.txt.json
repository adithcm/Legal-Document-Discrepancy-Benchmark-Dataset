                "original_text": "12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without reference to any principles of conflicts of law thereof. Any suit or proceeding arising in respect of this Agreement will be tried exclusively in the United States District Court of the Southern District of the State of New York or, if that court declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other State Court in the State of New York or Federal court of the United States of America located in the State of New York, and both parties irrevocably and unconditionally agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and to venue in, such courts (and agree not to commence any action, suit, or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts). Both parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of this Agreement in such court, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit, or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Both parties further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth below shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against the parties in any such court. BOTH PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING REGARDING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.",
                "changed_text": "1.11 Optional Dispute Resolution. Any suit or proceeding arising in respect of this Agreement will be tried in a jurisdiction to be mutually agreed upon at the time a dispute arises. Both parties hereby waive their rights to object to the selected venue, which is understood to be the chosen forum at that time. Both parties agree that the method of service shall be determined at the time of a dispute, and may not include registered mail. BOTH PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY MAY BE AVAILABLE, DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION SELECTED AT THE TIME OF A DISPUTE.",
                "explanation": "By moving the governing law and dispute resolution clause to a new optional section, it's enforceability is affected. The optional dispute resolution introduces conflicts and makes it ambiguous whether New York law and jurisdiction apply. The changed text also implies that the method of service and jury trial depend on the jurisdiction selected at the time of a dispute, further contradicting the original clause and creating legal uncertainty. Jurisdiction requirements require specificity.",

M. Best rating of A, including Product Recall, Bodily Injury and Property Damage Insurance, with a combined single limit of not less than $[***] per occurrence and $[***] in the aggregate annually (this limit can be secured via a combination of primary and excess/umbrella policies). In addition, each of the Parties shall maintain and keep in force at its sole cost and expense throughout the Term of this Agreement and for three years following the effective date of expiration or termination hereof (if such policies are on a claims made basis), Product Liability Insurance from carriers having an A.M. Best rating of A with a combined single limit of not less than $[***] per occurrence and in the aggregate annually. 10.4.2 Each party agrees to provide the other party with a Certificate of Insurance evidencing such coverage, naming the other party as an additional insured. Each party agrees to give the other party written notice, promptly, of any material change in or cancellation of coverages or limits. In addition, if and for so long as Supplier utilizes any subcontractor(s) or agents to provide services hereunder, Supplier will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such subcontractor to hold, at least, the minimum insurance coverages listed above.",
                "changed_text": "4.6 Optional Insurance Provisions. Each of Supplier and CUTANEA will consider maintaining insurance, but are not required to do so. If insurance is maintained, each party may provide the other party with a Certificate of Insurance, but is not required to do so. Each party will endeavor to provide notice of changes or cancellation of coverages, but is not required to do so. Insurance coverage by subcontractors is optional.",
                "explanation": "By moving the insurance requirements to an 'Optional Insurance Provisions' section, the enforceability of the original clauses regarding mandatory insurance coverage is negated. By changing 'shall maintain' to will 'consider maintaining,' it introduces a contradiction, making the insurance coverage discretionary rather than mandatory. It can be argued that the entire insurance clause is now unenforceable.",

In the event that a party becomes debarred, the debarred party agrees to notify the other party immediately if the same affects Supplier's ability to lawfully supply the Products or CUTANEA's ability to lawfully purchase the Products. 5.8.2 Each of the parties represents, warrants, certifies and covenants that to the best of its knowledge it has not and will not use in any capacity the services of any individual, corporation, partnership, or association which has been convicted or debarred under Section 306 of the Act or similar local law. In the event that a party becomes aware of or receives notice of the conviction or debarment of any individual, corporation, partnership, or association providing services to such party, which relates to the execution or performance of this Agreement, Supplier agrees to notify CUTANEA immediately.",

                "explanation": "The 'Debarment' clause, which ensures that neither party is excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs, is moved to a 'Miscellaneous Compliance' section and diluted to a vague statement. This makes it difficult to enforce the original intent of the clause. It removes the specific reference to Section 306 of the Act and replaces it with a casual statement, creating contradiction and uncertainty about the parties' obligations.",

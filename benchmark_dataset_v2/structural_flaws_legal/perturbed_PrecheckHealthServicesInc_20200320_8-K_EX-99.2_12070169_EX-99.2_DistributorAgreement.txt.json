                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state where the Distributor's headquarters are located; however, all marketing materials will be governed by the laws of Nevada.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Texas law governs the entire agreement. The modified clause introduces ambiguity and contradiction by suggesting the law of the Distributor's headquarters applies to the agreement generally, while Nevada law governs marketing materials. This creates uncertainty about which state's laws apply to different aspects of the contract, undermining enforceability and potentially conflicting with the original intent.",

                "explanation": "The original clause prohibits any challenges to the termination. The modified clause contradicts this by allowing a claim for breach of contract if the termination is deemed unjustified. This introduces a contradiction as it both forbids and permits challenging the termination, leading to uncertainty about the parties' rights and obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes the distributor as an independent contractor with no authority to bind the Principal. The changed clause adds that the Principal retains the right to direct the Distributor's sales strategy. This creates a contradiction because the Principal's direct control over sales strategy could blur the line between independent contractor and employee, potentially leading to misclassification issues and violating labor laws. The explicit designation of 'independent contractor' is undermined by the degree of control exerted by the Principal.",

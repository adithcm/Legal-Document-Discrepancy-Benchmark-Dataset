EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY ACTION RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.",

EACH OF THE PARTIES SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY ACTION RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY' weakens the jurisdiction clause. While New York law is still specified, the absence of the explicit waiver could allow a party to argue for jurisdiction elsewhere, contradicting the intent of the original clause.",

                "explanation": "Adding 'unless otherwise mutually agreed upon' introduces a loophole to the jury trial waiver. It creates an exception that can be exploited to argue against the waiver, contradicting the initial intent of an 'IRREVOCABLE AND UNCONDITIONAL' waiver and potentially leading to litigation on whether such mutual agreement was reached.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'would be irreparably harmed' to '*might* be harmed' and 'without posting bond or other security' to '*possibly* without posting bond or other security' weakens the Licensor's position regarding injunctive relief. The original clause presumes irreparable harm and waives the bond requirement, making it easier to obtain an injunction. The modified clause introduces uncertainty regarding both, potentially requiring Licensor to prove irreparable harm and post a bond, thereby hindering their ability to quickly enforce the agreement.",

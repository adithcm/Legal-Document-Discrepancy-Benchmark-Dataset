Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Company and the Association jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Capital Resources, its officers, directors, agents and employees and each person, if any, who controls or is under common control with Capital Resources within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, that Capital Resources or any of them may suffer or to which Capital Resources and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by Capital Resources or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion Application or any Blue Sky application or other instrument or document of the Company or the Association or based upon written information supplied by the Company or the Association filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or the subscription rights applicable thereto under the securities laws thereof (collectively, the \"Blue Sky Application\"), or any application or other document, advertisement, oral statement, or communication (\"Sales Information\") prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Company with its consent or based upon written or oral information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Association, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify or register the Shares under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents or information, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or, (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statements or alleged untrue material statements in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion Application, any Blue Sky Application, the preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or Sales Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Association by Capital Resources regarding Capital Resources expressly for use under the caption \"The Conversion - Marketing Arrangements\" in the Offering Prospectus nor is indemnification required for material oral misstatements made by Capital Resources, which are not based upon information provided by the Association or the Company orally or in writing or based on information contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information distributed in connection with the Conversion.",

However, the Company and the Association jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Capital Resources, its officers, directors, agents and employees and each person, if any, who controls or is under common control with Capital Resources against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever, only if Capital Resources repays any fees received under this agreement, and it will be determined by Capital Resources that the indemnification would create material damage to the association and no indemnification is required under this paragraph.",

The added requirement to repay fees and the subjective determination of material damage significantly reduce Capital Resources' ability to rely on this clause.",

In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason unavailable as a result of Section 9(e) or held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the Association or Capital Resources, the Company, the Association and Capital Resources shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding of any claims asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company or the Association or Capital Resources from persons other than the other party thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that Capital Resources is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to Capital Resources pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings and the Company and the Association shall be responsible for the balance.  If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 9 above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company and the Association on the one hand and Capital Resources on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and Association on the one hand and Capital Resources on the other from the offering as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Association on the one hand and Capital Resources on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total gross proceeds from the Subscription and Public Offerings (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total fees (not including expenses) received by Capital Resources. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and/or the Association on the one hand or Capital Resources on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Association and Capital Resources agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that Capital Resources shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to Capital Resources under this Agreement.  It is understood that the above-stated limitation on Capital Resources' liability is essential to Capital Resources and that Capital Resources relied upon such limitation and would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement.  No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company and the Association under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Association may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10, each of Capital Resources', the Company's or the Association's officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls Capital Resources or the Company or the Association within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Association.\n\nAny party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10.",

This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which so executed and delivered shall be an  original, but all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Contribution is subject to the requirement that, should indemnification by the company be sought, it is the sole responsibility of the indemnified to give notice to the indemnifying party and to guarantee indemnification. Moreover, Capital Resources is not liable for claims unless otherwise determined. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10.\n",

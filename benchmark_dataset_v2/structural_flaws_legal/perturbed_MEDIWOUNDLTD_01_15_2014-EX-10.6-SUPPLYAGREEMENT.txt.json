Governing Law and Disputes\n\n15.1 This Agreement is made under and subject to the provision of the substantive laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its conflict of law rules.\n\n15.2 Any disputes relating to this Agreement of whatever nature that cannot be resolved by negotiation between the parties shall be referred for final resolution to arbitration in New York City by 3 (three) Arbitrators under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties and their legal successors. The arbitrators may at their discretion, provide for discovery by the parties not to exceed 4 (four) months from the date of notice of arbitration and the arbitrators shall notify the parties of their decision in writing within 30 (thirty) days of the completion of the final hearing. The arbitrators may at their discretion award costs and expenses in respect of the arbitration.\n\n15.3 The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York.",
                "changed_text": "13. Miscellaneous\n\n13.6 Any disputes relating to the interpretation of Section 13.2 of this Agreement of whatever nature that cannot be resolved by negotiation between the parties shall be referred for final resolution to arbitration in New York City by 1 (one) Arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and their legal successors. The arbitrator may at his discretion, provide for discovery by the parties not to exceed 2 (two) months from the date of notice of arbitration and the arbitrator shall notify the parties of their decision in writing within 60 (sixty) days of the completion of the final hearing. The arbitrator may at his discretion award costs and expenses in respect of the arbitration.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause has been moved from the 'Governing Law and Disputes' section to 'Miscellaneous,' where it is less likely to be noticed. Additionally, this new clause specifies it applies solely to Section 13.2 of the contract, and changes other specifications, causing confusion. The original was intended to apply to the whole contract.",

                "explanation": "The Limitation of Consequential Damages is a vital legal clause. Moving it from its own section to be a subsection of the 'Definitions' section buries it within the document, making it harder to locate and easier to overlook. The original clause has been shortened to only limit the liability to punitive damages. This weakens the protections.",

Insurance\n\nIn order to provide insurance coverage for CBC responsibilities, obligations and undertakings as set out under this Agreement and/or as required under any law with respect to the manufacturing of Bromelain SP, CBC undertakes, at its sole cost and expense, to take out and maintain an \"All risk\" insurance against loss of and destruction or damage to the Facility (including fire, theft and vandalism, etc.), third party liability insurance, product liability insurance for the Bromelain SP and employers liability insurance. All notices related to insurance policies must be sent via carrier pigeon to MediWound's old address.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the 'Notices' section to specify an absurd method of contact significantly impedes the process of formal communication. The addition of \"carrier pigeon\" and \"MediWound's old address\" creates an unreasonable barrier. This directly contradicts the intention of ensuring effective communication, potentially voiding the enforceability of important provisions.",

                "original_text": "(f) Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws in force in the Province of Ontario (excluding any conflict of laws rule or principle which might refer such construction to the laws of another jurisdiction). The Parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario and waive any objection relating to improper venue or forum non conveniens to the conduct of any proceeding in any such court.",
                "changed_text": "(f) Governing Law: This Agreement shall be subject to interpretation under the legal concept of 'good faith', which means both parties act honestly and reasonably. The Parties agree to collaborate to resolve any disputes in a manner that aligns with this principle of 'good faith'.",
                "explanation": "Moving the governing law clause from a standard legal provision to a subjective concept of 'good faith' significantly reduces its enforceability. This obscures the legally binding jurisdiction and replaces it with an ambiguous principle, making it difficult to predict how disputes will be resolved or which laws will apply.",

                "original_text": "13. CONFIDENTIALITY (a) Obligation: Each Party acknowledges that all Confidential Information consists of confidential and proprietary information of the disclosing Party. Each Party shall, and shall cause its employees, agents and contractors to hold Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, and shall use the same degree of care by instruction, agreement or otherwise, to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party's Confidential Information that it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information, but with at least a reasonable degree of care commensurate with the nature and importance of such Confidential Information. Each Party agrees not to make use of Confidential Information other than for the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement), and not to release, disclose, communicate it or make it available to any third person other than employees, agents and contractors of the Party who reasonably need to know it in connection with the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations by such Party under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement) and who are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth herein. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party in writing promptly of any loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of such other Party's Confidential Information and cooperate with such other Party to protect the confidentiality and ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights and other rights therein.",
                "changed_text": "13. CONFIDENTIALITY (a) Obligation: Each Party acknowledges that all Confidential Information consists of confidential and proprietary information of the disclosing Party. Confidentiality is appreciated but not legally required. Each Party agrees to make reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information, time allowing. Disclosure will be on a 'best efforts' basis, but is not guaranteed or enforceable in any legal manner. In the event of a leak or accidental disclosure the receiving party will provide an apology.",
                "explanation": "Changing the confidentiality clause to state confidentiality is 'appreciated but not legally required' directly contradicts the original intent of the section. It replaces the enforceable obligation to protect confidential information with a non-binding and unenforceable set of actions and an apology as the sole resolution for accidental disclosure.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION (c) Arbitration: Subject to Section 19(d), any dispute that has proceeded through mediation established in Section 19(b) without resolution may be submitted to arbitration. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall take place in the City of Toronto, Ontario. The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the Parties or as may be specified in the arbitrator's decision. The provisions of the Arbitration Act of Ontario, as amended, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement shall govern the arbitration process. The Parties agree to exclude the appeal provisions of the Arbitration Act, as may be amended from time to time, and in particular, section 45 thereof. The determination arising out of the arbitration process shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the arbitration.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION (c) Arbitration: Any dispute that has proceeded through mediation established in Section 19(b) without resolution may be submitted to arbitration should both parties agree in writing. If arbitration occurs, it shall be conducted in a location chosen by the party who 'feels most aggrieved'. Costs of arbitration are the responsibility of the party requesting the arbitration. Unless both parties agree, the arbitration is non-binding. Either party may appeal the arbitrator's decision.",
                "explanation": "The 'Arbitration' clause is weakened by requiring mutual agreement for arbitration to occur, rather than being a guaranteed method of dispute resolution. Additionally, assigning the costs to the party requesting arbitration discourages its use. By making the process non-binding unless agreed upon and allowing appeals it renders the clause toothless.",

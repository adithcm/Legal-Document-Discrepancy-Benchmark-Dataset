                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Swiss law, unless the parties mutually agree to apply the laws of another jurisdiction at a later date. The conflict of law rules and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods do not apply.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Swiss law as governing, but the modified clause introduces a contradiction by allowing parties to later agree on a different jurisdiction. This weakens the enforceability of the Swiss law provision.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'irrevocably' and adding the clause about alternative dispute resolution, the exclusivity of Zurich courts is undermined. This creates a legal contradiction by implying that court proceedings are not necessarily the primary or exclusive method for dispute resolution, affecting the enforceability of the jurisdiction clause.",

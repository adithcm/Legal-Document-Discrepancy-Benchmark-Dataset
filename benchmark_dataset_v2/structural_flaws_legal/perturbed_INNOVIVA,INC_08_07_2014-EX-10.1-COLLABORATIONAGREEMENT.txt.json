During normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice to the Recording Party, such records shall be made available for inspection, review and audit, at the request and expense of Theravance, by an independent certified public accountant, or the local equivalent, appointed by Theravance and reasonably acceptable to the Recording Party for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the Recording Party's accounting reports and payments made or to be made pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however that such audits may not be performed by Theravance more than once per Calendar Year. Such accountants shall be instructed not to reveal to Theravance the details of its review, except for (i) such information as is required to be disclosed under this Agreement and (ii) such information presented in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions to Theravance, and all such information shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Recording Party; provided, however, that in any event such information may be presented to Theravance in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions.

This change introduces a structural flaw by creating ambiguity about the retention period, undermining its enforceability, and making it harder for Theravance to verify Net Sales accurately. \n\nAdditionally, the relocation of \"The documents from which were calculated the sums due under this Article 6 shall be retained by the relevant Party during the Term.\" to the top of the paragraph create confusion in the audit procedure.",

                "explanation": "Moving the Disclaimer of Warranty clause to Article 16 (Miscellaneous), and renaming Article 16.11 (Entire Agreement), lessens the prominence and immediacy of the disclaimer. Disclaimers are expected in \"Representations and Warranties\" section in the contract. Relocating it buries it among general terms, reducing the likelihood it will be carefully reviewed in the context of product liability. This weakens its enforceability, especially in jurisdictions requiring clear and conspicuous disclaimers.",

Such arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be conducted in accordance with then current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall have the right to award or include in his award any relief that he or she deems proper in the circumstances, including without limitation, money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from date due), specific performance, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and costs. The award and decision of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding on all parties to this agreement, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and each such party waives any right to contest the validity or enforceability of such award. The provisions of this Paragraph are intended to benefit and limit third-party non-signatories, and will continue in full force and effect subsequent to, and notwithstanding expiration or termination of, this Agreement. You and we agree that any such arbitration shall be conducted on an individual, not a class-wide basis, and shall not be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "17.5 No Guarantees.\n\n   If in connection with this Agreement we provide to you any waiver, approval, consent, or suggestion, or if we neglect or delay our response or deny any request for any of those, then we will not be deemed to have made any warranties or guarantees upon which you may rely, and will not assume any liability or obligation to you. Except insofar as we elect to enforce this Agreement or to seek temporary or permanent injunctive relief as provided above, all controversies, disputes or claims arising between us, our affiliates, and our and their respective owners, officers, directors, agents, and employees (in their representative capacity) and you (and your Principal Owners and guarantors) arising out of or related to: (1) this Agreement, any provision thereof, or any related agreement (except for any lease or sublease with us or any of our affiliates); (2) the relationship of the parties hereto; (3) the validity of this Agreement or any related agreement, or any provision thereof; or (4) any specification, standard or operating procedure relating to the establishment or operation of the Franchise, shall be submitted for arbitration to be administered. In case of failure, arbitration is at the discretion of both parties.",
                "explanation": "The relocation of the arbitration clause into the \"No Guarantees\" section creates an ambiguity and reduces its enforceability. Arbitration clauses are intended to be clear and distinct, yet placing it under \"No Guarantees\" implies that even the mandatory arbitration is not guaranteed, impacting its legal weight.",

If we establish such prices for any services or products, you agree not to exceed or reduce that price, but will charge the price for the service or product that we establish. You hereby agree to apply any pricing matrix or schedule established by us. If you wish to offer an alternate pricing matrix, you must obtain our prior written approval. In states where you must enter a Management Agreement (Section 2.3), this provision shall be modified, to the extent legally permissible, and/or legally construed to conform to the laws of the state where your Franchise location will be located.",

Location franchises; (2) purchasing approved equipment, furniture, furnishings, signs, materials and supplies; (3) development and implementation of local advertising and promotional programs; (4) general operating and management procedures; (5) establishing and conducting employee training programs for your Franchise; and (6) changes in any of the above that occur from time to time. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may periodically establish maximum and/or minimum prices for services and products that the Franchise location offers, including without limitation, prices for promotions in which all or certain The Joint Franchise locations participate.

You hereby agree to apply any pricing matrix or schedule established by us. If you wish to offer an alternate pricing matrix, you must obtain our prior written approval.",
                "explanation": "The clause regarding pricing has been moved under a section about \"Guidance and Assistance\" creates an ambiguity. Pricing controls should be part of operating standards not just guidance. This reduces the clause's enforceability as the franchisee might interpret the pricing guidelines as mere suggestions rather than mandatory obligations.",

Best rating of A-VIII or better approved by us, and in such amounts as we may determine from time to time: (1) comprehensive public, professional, product, medical malpractice and motor vehicle liability insurance against claims for bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the operation of the Franchise or otherwise in conjunction with your conduct of the Franchise Business pursuant to this Agreement, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage amounts as set forth in the Operations Manual; (2) general casualty insurance, including theft, cash theft, fire and extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief insurance, for the replacement value of the Franchise and its contents, and any other assets of the Franchise; (3) worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as required by law, with limits equal to or in excess of those required by statute; (4) business interruption insurance for a period adequate to reestablish normal business operations, but in any event not less than six (6) months; (5) any other insurance required by applicable law, rule, regulation, ordinance or licensing requirements; and (6) umbrella liability coverage with limits of not less than $1,000,000/$3,000,000 or such other amounts that we may establish in the Operations Manual. You must purchase such insurance coverage(s) only from our approved or designated supplier(s). We may periodically increase or decrease the amounts of coverage required under these insurance policies, and/or require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance, to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 General Manager.\n\n   At your request, we may, but are not obligated to, agree for you to employ a general manager to operate the Franchise (\"General Manager\"). The term \"General Manager\" means an individual with primary day-to-day responsibility for the Franchise's operations, and may or may not be you (if you are an individual) or a Principal Owner, officer, director, or employee of yours (if you are other than an individual). We may or may not require that the General Manager have an equity interest in the Franchise. The General Manager will be obligated to devote his or her full time, best efforts, and constant personal attention to the Franchise's operations, and must have full authority from you to implement the System at the Franchise. You must not hire any General Manager or successor General Manager without first receiving our written approval of such General Manager's qualifications. Each General Manager and successor General Manager must attend and complete our Initial Training (as defined herein). No General Manager may have any interest in or business relationship with any business competitor of your franchise. Each General Manager must sign a written agreement, in a form approved by us, to maintain confidential our Confidential Information described in Paragraph 9.1, and to abide by the covenants not to compete described in Paragraph 9.3. You must forward to us a copy of each such signed agreement. If we determine, in our sole discretion, during or following completion of the Initial Training program, that your General Manager (if any) is not qualified to act as General Manager of the Franchise, then we have the right to require you to choose (and obtain our approval of) a new individual for that position. Before you open the Franchise and during any Term of this Agreement, you must maintain in force, under policies of insurance written on an occurrence basis issued by carriers with an A.M. Best rating of A-VIII or better approved by us, and in such amounts as we may determine from time to time. For minor infractions of the agreement, insurance might be optional, depending on the availability of said insurance policies.",
                "explanation": "Mandatory insurance requirements have been inserted into the section describing General Manager. Section 10.8 provides the details of comprehensive insurance policies required to protect the business. This is crucial for mitigating risks. Relocating this clause and then following that with a statement that insurance may be optional creates ambiguity and weakens the legal obligation for the franchisee to secure adequate insurance coverage.",

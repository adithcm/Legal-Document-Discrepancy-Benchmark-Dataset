This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Israel (including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute), without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Israel or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Israel.",
                "changed_text": "7.2 Governing Law. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby and/or the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Israel unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties at the time of a dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that Israeli law governs the agreement. The modification introduces an exception allowing for an alternative agreement at the time of a dispute. This contradicts the initial provision, creating uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws ultimately apply. This affects the enforceability of the clause because it is unclear whether the reference to the Israeli laws is actually binding or subject to change.",

The Parties hereby submit any disputes under this Agreement to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Tel-Aviv, Israel, provided however, that either party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other appropriate remedy against the other in a mutually agreed upon country.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tel-Aviv courts but allows Recipient to seek injunctions elsewhere. The modified text removes the 'irrevocably' aspect, making jurisdiction discretionary and opens it to mutually agreed upon country, which introduces an element of uncertainty and potential conflict regarding where disputes should be resolved. By adding 'mutually agreed upon country' for both parties, it introduces contradiction and ambiguity.",

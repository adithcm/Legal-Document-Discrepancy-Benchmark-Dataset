In the event of any dispute arising out of this Agreement, MICOA and Agency agree to submit such dispute to arbitration as follows:\n\n                  a.       There shall be three arbitrators; one shall be\n                            selected by the Agency, one shall be selected by\n                            MICOA, and a third shall be selected by those two\n                            arbitrators. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on\n                            the selection of a third, American Arbitration\n                            Association's regional office closest to Agency's\n                            main office shall be requested to appoint the third\n                            arbitrator.\n\n                  b.

In the event of any dispute arising out of this Agreement, MICOA and Agency agree to submit such dispute to arbitration as follows:\n\n                  a.  In cases of disputes, both parties may choose mediation as a first step, without forfeiting their right to arbitration.\n\n                  b.       The determination of the arbitrators shall not be final\n                            and binding upon the Agency and MICOA. Instead, either party may appeal the arbitrator's decision within 30 days.\n\n                  c.  Punitive and/or exemplary damages may be awarded at the arbitrator's discretion.\n\n                  d.  The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of an arbitrator chosen mutually. The Agency and MICOA shall pay the cost of their arbitrator and share equally in the expense of the third arbitrator, or each pay for an agreed-upon single arbitrator.\n\n                  e.  Either Party, may where permitted by the law of Nevada, enter judgment upon the arbitrators' award, unless appealed.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration and details its procedure. The modified clause adds the option of mediation, weakens the binding nature of arbitration, allows for punitive damages, and alters arbitration procedures. This contradicts the original clause's firm arbitration agreement, making enforcement uncertain. The Year 2000 Compliance section placement obscures it, as it is not easily found within the dispute resolution section.",

The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.",

Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be                   offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers'                   compensation, and its other nonphysician professional                   liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds                   with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include                   Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal                   products.

Terms and limits of coverage shall be determined by the Agency alone.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires the Agency to maintain specific insurance and provide copies to MICOA as a precondition. The modified clause removes the mandatory provision of providing policy copies and weakens the requirement that MICOA approve of the terms of coverage, instead giving the agency autonomy over the terms of the insurance. The section relocation to 'Potential Opportunities' makes it less prominent, affecting enforceability.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes an exclusive agreement where the Agency cannot sell competing products without MICOA's consent. The modified clause nullifies the exclusivity, stating that the Agency can sell competing products on a non-exclusive basis. This is a contradiction to the initial exclusivity agreement.

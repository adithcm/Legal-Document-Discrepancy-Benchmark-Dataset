Company further represents that it has not received any written notice of a claim and otherwise has no knowledge that the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, violate or infringe upon the rights of any Person. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Investor, Investors' Affiliates, and their officers and directors, and their direct and indirect customers, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, diminution in value, deficiencies, actions, proceedings, taxes, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of investigation as incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the representations made in this Article 3.09.",
                "changed_text": "Company represents that to the best of its knowledge, the methods described and claimed in the Patents and the Technical Information, and the products produced thereby in accordance with such information, will be free from claims of infringement of the patents and copyrights of any Third Party.

However, the indemnification is optional and subject to negotiation.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall' to 'may' makes the indemnification clause optional and introduces ambiguity. The addition of 'However, the indemnification is optional and subject to negotiation' further weakens the clause, rendering it less enforceable and contradicting the intent of providing a guarantee against infringement claims. This is a substantial change that undermines the investor's protection against potential legal liabilities stemming from IP infringement.",

                "explanation": "Introducing 'Martian Law' as a governing law creates a legal contradiction and absurdity. Martian Law does not exist, therefore this clause is nonsensical and creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws actually govern the contract, undermining the clause's validity and enforceability. This directly contradicts the initial specification of New York and US law.",

                "explanation": "While this article states that the resolution shall be exclusive in the procedure written, introducing 'trial by combat' goes against the exclusive dispute resolution mechanism, and introduces absurdity. Trial by combat does not exist, therefore this clause is nonsensical and creates uncertainty about the real dispute resolution mechanism that the parties will use.",

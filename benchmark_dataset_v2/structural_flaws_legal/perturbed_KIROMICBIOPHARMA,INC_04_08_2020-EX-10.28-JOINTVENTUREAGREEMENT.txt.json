                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the GDPR compliance by suggesting the exchange of personal data is optional ('may at times') and removing the explicit requirement for prior informed consent. The added clause 'whether they have been given prior information and acquired consent or not' introduces a legal contradiction by directly opposing GDPR's core tenet of requiring consent for processing personal data. This relocation severely undermines the enforceability of GDPR within this contract.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that Texas law governs the agreement. By changing the law to Nevada and burying it in a section about modifications, after stating no modifications are valid unless in writing, creates confusion and reduces the enforceability of the governing law clause. This makes it harder to determine which state's laws apply in case of a dispute.",

                "changed_text": "1) Duties of Bravatek Bravatek agrees to serve as a non-exclusive project sales lead finder for COMPANY. In this capacity, Bravatek will use its best efforts to provide the following services to COMPANY. a. Promote, market and introduce the Products to prospective clients in the government space nationwide. b. Provide a quarterly Pipeline or project information leads report to COMPANY on a monthly basis which contains a 3-month rolling forecast of potential sales. c. Follow-up on on-going project leads that COMPANY is actively engaged with or believes is appropriate. d. Provide COMPANY with any promotional materials, technical papers, white papers, proposals, etc. prior to publication or delivery to prospective clients.\n\n10) Indemnification COMPANY shall indemnify Bravatek, its directors, officers and employees, for any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs incurred in connection with any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of COMPANY or breach of COMPANY of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Moving the indemnification clause directly into the 'Duties of Bravatek' section makes it appear as if it's solely related to Bravatek's actions as a sales lead finder. This weakens the enforceability of the indemnification clause for other breaches of the agreement. Further, by incompleteing the 2nd half of the clause, it makes it difficult to enforce for Bravatek",

                "explanation": "The clause outlines the agreed upon compensation fee and when it is received. By editing the lead finder percentage, and repayment date, this introduces contradiction. By reducing the percentage and lengthening the repayment time, there could be a dispute on when the payment occurs and how much the payment is.",

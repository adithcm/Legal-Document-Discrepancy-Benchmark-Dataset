                "changed_text": "21.5 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.\n\n21.5.1 This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with principles of fairness and equity, referencing generally accepted business practices.\n\n21.5.2 The Parties agree that any dispute arising out of this Agreement will first be subject to non-binding mediation. Only in the event that mediation fails, the parties may pursue other remedies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Delaware law and exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware courts. The modified clause replaces this with vague principles of fairness and equity, eliminates the jurisdiction clause, and mandates non-binding mediation before other remedies, making the dispute resolution process uncertain and difficult to enforce in a specific legal framework.",

During the performance of this contract or any purchase order issued hereunder, the Supplier agrees to comply with all applicable Federal, state and local laws respecting discrimination in employment and non-segregation of facilities including, but not limited to, requirements set out at 41 CFR §60-1.4, 41 CFR §61-300.10, 29 CFR Part 471 Appendix A to Subpart A, 41 CFR §60-300.5 and 41 CFR §60-741.5, which specific clauses are herein incorporated by reference into all covered contracts and subcontracts as required by Federal law. This Supplier and any applicable subcontractor shall abide by the requirements of 41 CFR §60- 300.5(a) and §60-741.5(a) to the extent applicable. These regulations prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals on the basis of protected veteran status or disability, and require affirmative action by covered prime contractors and subcontractors to employ and advance in employment qualified protected veterans and individuals with disabilities.",

                "explanation": "Moving the U.S. Government Affirmative Action Regulations to a section named 'Affirmative Action' and changing the language to 'strive for a diverse workforce' and 'addressed on a case-by-case basis' significantly weakens the enforceability of the required compliance with specific federal regulations. It replaces the specific legal requirements with a general aspirational goal, making it difficult to prove non-compliance or hold the Supplier accountable to the mandated regulations.",

Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, a receiving Party is hereby notified in accordance with the US Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 that it will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any US federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (x) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (y) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding.",

Supplier will not offer any gift to a PNC employee, contractor, or agent that is: (i) more than a nominal value; (ii) more than an infrequent occurrence; (iii) cash or cash equivalents; or (iv) illegal, sexually oriented, offensive or otherwise inappropriate. However, should the employee feel compelled to disclose potential trade secrets, this will be taken into consideration.",
                "explanation": "Moving the notification regarding the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) out of the section on confidential information and implying that the disclosure of potential trade secrets will be taken into consideration in a section about gifts and entertainment introduces ambiguity and undermines the clarity of the protection offered by the DTSA. This placement makes it more difficult for the receiving party to be aware of their rights and protections under the DTSA, potentially discouraging legitimate whistleblowing.",

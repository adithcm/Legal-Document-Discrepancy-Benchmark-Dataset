Dispute Resolution and Attorneys' Fees:\n   (a) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County before an arbitrator who is a retired U.S. District Court judge. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement. Nothing in this agreement clause shall preclude parties from seeking provisional or injunctive relief remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.",

Entire Agreement: \nThis Agreement contains the entire contract of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all agreements and understandings between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall in every case be construed simply according to its fair meaning.\n\n22. Dispute Resolution and Attorneys' Fees:\n   (a) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined in a manner agreeable to both parties, potentially including arbitration. The arbitration, if agreed upon, shall be administered by a mutually selected organization. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Provisional or injunctive relief remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction may be considered.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration for all disputes. The modified clause introduces ambiguity by suggesting disputes will be resolved 'in a manner agreeable to both parties, potentially including arbitration.' This contradicts the original mandatory arbitration clause, creating uncertainty regarding the dispute resolution process. This is a structural flaw because mandatory arbitration clauses are standard procedure.",

Insurance:\n   MusclePharm shall, throughout the Term of the Agreement and for a period of not less than four years thereafter, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense from a qualified insurance company licensed to do business in California and New York, a commercial general liability insurance policy including coverage for contractual liability (applying to the terms and conditions of this agreement), product liability, personal injury liability, and advertiser's liability, in a form approved by the AS Parties, in the amount of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence naming the AS Parties (for the avoidance of doubt, specifically including each of Lender, Endorser, and Fitness) as additional named insureds. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such policy shall provide protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any defects or failure to perform, alleged or otherwise, of the Products and Licensed Products or any material used in connection therewith or any use thereof. The policy shall provide for ten (10) days notice to the AS Parties from the insurer by Registered or Certified Mail, return receipt requested, in the event of any modification, cancellation, or termination thereof. MusclePharm agrees to furnish the AS Parties a certificate of insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement and, in no event, shall MusclePharm manufacture, distribute, advertise, or sell the Licensed Products prior to receipt by the AS Parties of such evidence of insurance. MusclePharm shall be responsible to provide for any appearances pursuant to this Agreement by Endorser appropriate certificates of insurance with coverage limits of at least Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence endorsed to name the AS Parties as additional named insureds with respect to claims arising out of appearances by Endorser.

Sales and Marketing Plan And AS Product Line and Trademarks:  \n(a) MusclePharm shall utilize its commercially reasonable efforts to advertise and promote the Licensed Products at its own expense and to sell the Licensed Products through the Distribution Channels worldwide as contemplated herein during the Term and to promote both the goodwill of the Endorser and the market reputation of the Licensed Products. MusclePharm will conduct its activities relating to the marketing of the Licensed Products in a professional manner. In that connection:\n27. Insurance:\n   MusclePharm may, at its discretion, obtain and maintain a commercial general liability insurance policy. The AS Parties acknowledge that MusclePharm is responsible for all deductibles.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates specific insurance coverage with minimum amounts, naming the AS Parties as insured. The modified clause makes insurance optional ('may, at its discretion') and removes the requirement for specific coverage and minimum amounts. It also shifts the sole responsibility of all deductibles. This contradiction significantly weakens the AS Parties' protection and creates uncertainty about the extent of insurance coverage. In CA, insurance requirements should be explicit, clear and in a separate area. The original clause also had requirements for minimum coverage.",

Quality Control:\n(a) MusclePharm acknowledges and agrees that, in order to maintain the goodwill and integrity of the Endorser, the Name and Appearance Rights, and the Trademarks (the \"Endorser IP\"), the Licensed Products shall be of a standard and of such style, appearance and quality as to protect and enhance the goodwill associated with the Endorser IP, which standard the AS Parties may from time to time prescribe and which, in any event, shall be of substantially the same or better quality than the samples previously provided by MusclePharm to Endorser. To this end, MusclePharm will use the approval form attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\" to obtain required approvals under this Agreement (including, ingredients contained in the Licensed Products). Prior to any use of any of the Endorser IP, MusclePharm shall submit to the AS Parties for the AS Parties' prior written approval all artwork, photos, images, writings, advertising campaigns, slogans, claims made and other Name and Appearance Rights associated with the Endorser IP, samples of materials and design of the Licensed Products on which the Endorser IP are to appear and of all advertising, press and promotional literature which MusclePharm intends to use in the marketing or merchandising of the Licensed Products using the submission form in Exhibit \"E\" attached hereto. The AS Parties shall respond to any such approval request within ten (10) business days. To the extent that the AS Parties shall fail to respond within such ten (10 day) period, the submissions shall be deemed disapproved. Should MusclePharm desire to submit the same request for approval, the AS Parties shall respond within five (5) days detailing the reason for disapproval. Should the AS Parties fail to respond in this last Five (5) business day period, submission shall be deemed approved. In addition, MusclePharm shall send, at its expense, at a minimum, two (2) representative samples of each Licensed Products, at each of the concept, pre-production and production stages, to the AS Parties at the address set forth in Section 20 below for prior approval. During the Term, MusclePharm will also send two (2) representative samples of the Licensed Products to the AS Parties at the address set forth in Section 20 below upon request so that the AS Parties can determine whether the quality of the Licensed Products bearing the Endorser IP is being maintained.",

The AS Parties acknowledge that MusclePharm is ultimately responsible for ensuring the products are safe and meet all regulatory requirements.",
                "explanation": "The original clause outlines a strict quality control process with mandatory approvals from the AS Parties at each stage. The modified clause weakens this process by stating MusclePharm has 'sole discretion' over quality control, undermining the AS Parties' approval rights. This contradiction creates ambiguity and undermines the AS Parties' rights. The initial obligation is strong and the subsequent change creates ambiguity. This could be considered misleading.",

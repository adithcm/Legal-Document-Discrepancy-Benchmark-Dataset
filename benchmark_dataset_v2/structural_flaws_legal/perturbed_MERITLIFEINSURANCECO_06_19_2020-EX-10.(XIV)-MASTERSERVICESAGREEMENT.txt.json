Except as otherwise specified below, all actions, disputes, claims and controversies under common law, statutory law or in equity of any type or nature whatsoever, whether arising before or after the date of this Agreement, and whether directly or indirectly\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\nrelating to: (a) this Agreement and/or any amendments and addenda hereto, or the breach, invalidity or termination hereof; (b) any previous or subsequent agreement between the parties; and/or (c) any other relationship, transaction or dealing between the parties (collectively the \"Disputes\"), will be subject to and resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of U.S. Arbitration & Mediation, (www.usam.com). Any award or order rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed as a judgment or order in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction, which includes within the federal judicial district of the residence of the party against whom such award or order was entered.",
                "changed_text": "14. INSURANCE. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Contractor shall maintain workers compensation insurance in the amount required by statute, comprehensive general liability insurance with coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) and professional errors and omissions insurance for bodily injury, property damage or other losses with coverage of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000), in connection with the provision of Services by Contractor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. At Company's request, Contractor shall provide Company with certificates or other acceptable evidence of insurance or self-insurance evidencing the above coverage and shall provide Company with prompt written notice of any material change.\n\n19. Arbitration. Except as otherwise specified below, all actions, disputes, claims and controversies of any type or nature whatsoever relating to this agreement, will be subject to and resolved by a method agreed upon by both parties. If both parties cannot agree, the dispute will be settled in court.",
                "explanation": "The original arbitration clause is moved to the Insurance section. A revised arbitration clause is made to appear, which makes the arbitration process subject to both parties to agree upon, introducing contradiction. This makes it more difficult to enforce arbitration as the primary means of dispute resolution because it requires agreement. This affects the clarity and enforceability of the agreement.",

Upon receipt of final payment Contractor shall provide to Company, and will assigns to Company, all right, title and interest to any Works in progress.",

Upon receipt of final payment Contractor shall retain all right, title and interest to any Works in progress.",
                "explanation": "Revising this clause contradicts the agreement by limiting payment to expenses only if there is no termination fee, conflicting with the earlier promise of paying 'all fees and expenses that have been incurred or earned.' Additionally, it deprives the company of any rights to work in progress, which is a contradiction with the previous version.",

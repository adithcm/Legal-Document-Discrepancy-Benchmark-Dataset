                "explanation": "By changing 'including reasonable legal fees' to 'excluding reasonable legal fees,' we create a contradiction. The original clause intends to protect BOSCH by ensuring CLIENT covers all legal costs. The modification suggests CLIENT does not cover BOSCH's legal fees, potentially undermining the protection BOSCH initially sought. This shift could make the indemnity clause less enforceable as it contradicts the expected purpose of such clauses.",

                "explanation": "The alteration states that Bosch grants the Client exclusive rights to sell and distribute the product in the Territory. However, the revised text creates a contradiction by adding that Bosch also grants a third party the same rights in the same territory. This contradicts the initial exclusivity granted to the Client, making the exclusivity provision unenforceable and potentially leading to disputes about who has the right to sell where. Therefore, the modified text creates a contradiction in the contract regarding exclusive rights to distribution.",

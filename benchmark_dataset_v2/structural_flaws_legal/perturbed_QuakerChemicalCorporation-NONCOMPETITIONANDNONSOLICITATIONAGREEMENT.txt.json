Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement. If any action or proceeding shall be commenced to enforce this Agreement or any right arising in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party the reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by such prevailing party in connection with such action or proceeding.",

Amendment Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by a party of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.\nEach Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate.

                "explanation": "The attorneys' fees clause is moved to a section regarding amendments and waivers, which is not logically related to dispute resolution or remedies. This misplacement can obscure the right of the prevailing party to recover attorneys' fees, especially since it's mixed in with clauses about waivers and amendments. This makes it harder to find and assert the right to attorneys' fees in case of a legal dispute.",
                "contradicted_law": "Pennsylvania law generally allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees if explicitly provided for in a contract, but such provisions are typically found in sections related to remedies or dispute resolution. Placing it in the 'Amendment Waivers, etc.' section obscures its relevance.",

                "explanation": "The order of the subsections within the 'Governing Law' section is changed. More importantly, the exclusive jurisdiction clause in section (b) is made non-exclusive.

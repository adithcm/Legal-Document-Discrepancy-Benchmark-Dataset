                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, Premier will be required to purchase [***] for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022 (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\"). Regarding the MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, this is only a non-binding estimate.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the MAOV for specific periods is a 'non-binding estimate,' the contract creates ambiguity regarding Premier's actual purchase obligations. The original clause specifies a required purchase amount, while the modification suggests this requirement is merely a suggestion. This introduces a contradiction that reduces the enforceability of the minimum purchase obligation.",

                "explanation": "Adding the phrase 'unless the parties mutually agree otherwise' gives both parties the leeway to ignore any part of the agreement, including all previously agreed terms. This renders the entire original contract, including the present amendment, unenforceable, as all terms are effectively rendered optional. It creates a fundamental contradiction between the intended binding nature of a contract and the possibility of unilateral or bilateral alteration without formal amendment.",

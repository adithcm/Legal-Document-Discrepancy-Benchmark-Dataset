                "original_text": "8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n    8.1.  Negotiation and Escalation.  If any controversy or claim arises relating to this Agreement, the Parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a solution to their differences, including progressively escalating any controversy or claim through senior levels of management.  If negotiation does not result in a resolution within 30 days of the date one Party first notifies the other of the controversy or claim, either Party may resort to arbitration under Section 8.2  [Arbitration].\n\n    8.2.  Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration].  The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes.  The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter.  The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement.  Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",
                "changed_text": "12.19 Dispute Resolution. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled through negotiation. If the parties cannot resolve the dispute through negotiation, then they may mutually agree to pursue mediation or arbitration. The specific method of dispute resolution, including the selection of mediator or arbitrator, will be determined by written agreement between the parties at the time the dispute arises.",
                "explanation": "By replacing the original Section 8 with a statement in Section 12.19, the mandatory arbitration clause is replaced by a clause emphasizing negotiation first, and then introduces ambiguity by stating that the parties may 'mutually agree' to mediation or arbitration. This contradicts the original explicit requirement for binding arbitration under AAA rules and makes the dispute resolution process uncertain and unenforceable.",

Neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.",
                "explanation": "Moving the limitation of liability clause to the miscellaneous section and removing the exception for breaches of confidentiality (Article 9) and intellectual property rights (Section 10.1.4(v)), as well as the indemnification obligations, significantly weakens the protections for those provisions. This creates a contradiction by seemingly making breaches of confidentiality and IP rights subject to the limitation of liability when they were explicitly excluded before, reducing the clarity and enforceability of these crucial protections.",

                "explanation": "By modifying the interest clause and moving it to the miscellaneous section, the mandatory nature of the interest and the defined interest rate (1% per month or maximum permitted by law) are removed. Instead, it becomes permissive ('may bear interest') and leaves the interest rate to be determined later by the creditor. This introduces uncertainty and contradiction, as the original clause provided a clear and enforceable interest rate, while the modified clause lacks specific terms and could be challenged as unenforceable due to vagueness.",

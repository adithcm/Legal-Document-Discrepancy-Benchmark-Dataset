Key elements include the following: (a) You must ensure that laptops, memory sticks, phones and other mobile devices are password protected and encrypted. You must not take such devices outside the office without encryption. You must take care of them and keep them secure. (b) You must use strong passwords, changing them when asked and not sharing them with unauthorised colleagues. (c) You must not access other individuals' personal data unless in the course of your work. Data breach - and urgent notification 18.5 If you discover a data breach, you must notify the Chairman or CFO immediately - and, if practicable, within one hour. Depending on context, you may then need to provide further information on the circumstances of the breach. 18.6 A data breach occurs where there is destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data which is being held, stored, transmitted or processed in any way. For example, there is a data breach if our servers are hacked or if you lose a laptop or USB stick or send an email to the wrong person by mistake. 18.7 Failure to notify a breach or to provide information as set out above will be treated seriously and disciplinary action may be taken.

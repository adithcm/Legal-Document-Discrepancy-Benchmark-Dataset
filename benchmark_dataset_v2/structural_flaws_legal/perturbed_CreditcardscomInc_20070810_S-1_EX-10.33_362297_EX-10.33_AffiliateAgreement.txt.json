Modification\n\nChase reserves the right to change any and all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion, by posting a new agreement on its Website. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions, the definition of Approved Accounts, and all other provisions of this Agreement are subject to change without notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE'S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.",
                "changed_text": "16. Service Interruption\n\nCertain technical difficulties may, from time to time, result in service interruptions. Affiliate agrees not to hold Chase responsible for the consequences of such interruptions.\n\n19. Modification\n\nChase reserves the right to change some of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, at any time and in its sole discretion, if affiliate agrees in writing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the amount of Commissions are subject to change with notice other than posting such information on the Chase Website. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. AFFILIATE'S CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM FOLLOWING CHASE'S POSTING OF A NEW AGREEMENT ON ITS WEB SITE WILL NOT CONSTITUTE BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE, unless affiliate agrees to the terms in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original modification clause clearly states that Chase can unilaterally change any terms, and continued use constitutes acceptance. This change introduces ambiguity by stating 'some of the terms and conditions,' and requiring written agreement by the affiliate, to some extent. This contradicts the original clause and can create legal challenges regarding which terms can be unilaterally changed and what constitutes acceptance.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty disclaimer explicitly disclaims all warranties. The modified version, while still mentioning warranties, introduces uncertainty with 'under certain conditions', and 'makes warranties' contradicting the original intent of a complete disclaimer. This creates a potential legal contradiction, as it's unclear what warranties are actually being offered and under what conditions. The contradiction can cause potential liability for Chase.",

                "explanation": "The original clause gives the affiliate the right to select or remove links at any time, which is now contradicted by not being able to remove them without approval. The original clauses also put the responsibility on the affiliate to obtain written approval, the revision removes that responsibility. By making those changes, the new term is contradictory to the original intent.",

                "explanation": "By changing the anti-bribery clause to a 'non-continuing basis,' limiting the knowledge requirement to 'actual' knowledge, restricting compliance to the initial agreement, and stating an intent of non-criminal action rather than an absolute warranty, and stating that improper payments will never be authorized it introduces a contradiction in terms. This weakens the overall anti-corruption warranty and potentially shields the franchisee from liability for future violations.",

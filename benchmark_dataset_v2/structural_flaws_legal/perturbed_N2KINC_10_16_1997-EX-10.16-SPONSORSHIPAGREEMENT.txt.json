                "type": "Structural Flaws - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules applicable to commercial disputes.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will use other dispute resolution means that are determined mutually.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates binding arbitration via the American Arbitration Association. The revised clause replaces this with a vague 'mutually determined' resolution, making enforcement uncertain. By removing the specific arbitration requirement, it undermines the original intent to have a clear and binding dispute resolution process.",
                "contradicted_law": "United States Arbitration Act, which favors clear and enforceable arbitration agreements.",
                "location": "Section 15(c)"

                "original_text": "Sponsor will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor will maintain records. Excite may request inspection but should be in accordance with internal policies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provided Excite with a clear right to audit Sponsor's records, including a process for notice, scope, and payment of fees. The revised version removes specificity, making it difficult for Excite to enforce audit rights. The reference to 'internal policies' introduces ambiguity, as these policies are not defined or accessible, hindering the enforceability of the audit clause.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring clarity and specificity in audit clauses.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement will be governed by laws.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states New York law governs the agreement, providing certainty in interpretation and enforcement. The revised version removes this crucial specification, leading to ambiguity about which jurisdiction's laws apply. This ambiguity creates uncertainty about how the contract will be interpreted and enforced, potentially leading to disputes about applicable law.",

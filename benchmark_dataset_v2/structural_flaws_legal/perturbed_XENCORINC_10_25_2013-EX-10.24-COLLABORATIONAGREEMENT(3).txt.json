The application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded. The Parties agree that all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its formation, existence, validity, enforceability, performance, interpretation, breach or termination, shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said rules. The exclusive place of arbitration shall be New York State of New York, USA and the proceedings shall be conducted in English language. The award for arbitration shall be final and binding and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction against BII or XENCOR. Nothing in this Section shall prevent any Party, before an arbitration has commenced hereunder or any time thereafter during such arbitration proceedings, from seeking conservatory and interim measures, including, but not limited to temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, or their equivalent, from any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties further agree that a. except as may be otherwise required by applicable laws, rules or regulations, neither Party, its witnesses, or the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, results of the arbitration hereunder without prior written consent of both Parties; and b. neither Party shall be required to give general discovery of documents, but may be required only to produce specific, identified documents, or narrow and specific categories of documents, which are relevant to the case and material to its outcome and reasonably believed to be in the custody, possession or control of the other Party; and c. decisions ex aequo et bono or in equity are not permissible.",
                "changed_text": "11.4 Publicity XENCOR or BII may issue the mutually agreed press release attached as Appendix 8 announcing the execution of this Agreement. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no press release or other form of publicity regarding a Project or this Agreement shall be permitted by either Party to be published unless both Parties have indicated their consent to the form of the release in writing. The same applies, to any changes in the press release attached as Appendix 8. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the Parties from disclosing this Agreement, if and as far as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations. However, the disclosing Party shall inform the other Party well in advance whenever reasonably possible and shall provide the opportunity to comment on such required disclosure (e.g. under SEC rules). In addition, subject to XENCOR's compliance with Section 9.1, nothing in this Section shall prevent XENCOR from disclosing the status of development, regulatory approval or commercialization of the Product.

                "explanation": "The arbitration clause, which is usually under \"Applicable Law and Arbitration,\" has been moved to \"Publicity.\" This relocation reduces its enforceability because it is not where one would typically look for dispute resolution mechanisms. Arbitration clauses are important and are meant to be easily accessible and visible, not hidden in a section about press releases.",

                "explanation": "The 'Notices' section, detailing how official communications should be delivered, has been misplaced under 'VAT'. This is problematic because the appropriate process for sending official communication about the contract is in an incorrect section. This obscures how official contract communication should occur, which can cause disputes and reduce enforceability.",

A summary of the preliminary plan for the Phase 1 clinical trial of the Product to be conducted by XENCOR is attached as Appendix 7, it being understood that timing of such clinical trial 13 may be delayed to the extent (i) caused primarily by BII's failure to provide Product conforming to the Specifications; or (ii) by safety issues relating to the Product; or (iii) by regulatory delays; or (iv) other causes outside the control of XENCOR. XENCOR shall promptly provide BII notice of the completion and a summary overview of the outcome/observations of the Phase 1 clinical trial regarding the Product and a summary overview of any negotiations with a possible Business Partner regarding the further development of the Product. Moreover, XENCOR shall inform BII on an annual basis or, if there is good cause, upon request of BII (whichever is the case) about the actual status of such Phase 1 clinical trial or such negotiations, such request not to be more often than twice per year. With the exception of wilful misconduct by a Party, and such cases where a limitation of liability and/or indemnification is not possible under applicable law, for which cases there shall be no limitation, any and all liability and/or indemnification obligations of each of BII and XENCOR under this Agreement shall be: a. excluded for incidental, indirect, consequential, punitive or special damages (provided that the foregoing shall not exclude a Party's right to consequential or incidental 25 damages for any negligent or intentional breach of confidentiality and non-use obligations under Section 9); and b. each Party's aggregate liability and/or indemnification obligations towards the other Party under this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to the average annual aggregate amount paid or to be paid by XENCOR to BII hereunder; provided, however, that in the case of a Party's negligent or intentional breach of confidentiality and non­use obligations pursuant to Section 9, this limitation of liability shall be increased to twice the average annual aggregate amount paid or to be paid by XENCOR to BII hereunder; provided however that the foregoing Subsections a. and b. of this Section 7.4 shall not limit XENCOR' s liability and indemnification obligation towards BII with respect to any third party claims according to clause (iii) and (iv) of Section 7.3 b. regarding any use of the Deliverables (in particular the Product) in humans and/or with respect to any third party claim that BII's use of the Material to manufacture the Product infringes any issued patent owed by such third party (excluding any such claim based specifically on use of the Process but not on the use of the Material).",
                "explanation": "The 'Limitation of Liability and Indemnification' terms has been relocated into section 2.8.3, \"Timelines and Information\" under 'Further Obligations of XENCOR.' This is a critical clause that directly impacts risk management and financial exposure in case of disputes, and would typically fall under Liability, Indemnification, or similar dedicated headings. Placing this provision within a section primarily discussing timelines and information related to clinical trials makes it difficult for a contracting party to recognize or fully appreciate its implications, especially since limitation of liability should be its own section.",

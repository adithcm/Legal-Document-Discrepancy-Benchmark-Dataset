                "original_text": "NON-CIRCUMVENT: As part of the Services provided under the Agreement and any applicable exhibits, Kubient will be working with and introducing certain third-party advertisers, sponsors, agencies, media buyers, service providers, vendors, publishers, affiliates and/or media partners (collectively \"Third-Party\") with whom Customer does not have a pre-existing relationship. During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer agrees not to work with, directly or indirectly, any Third-Party that Customer comes to know through disclosure by Kubient as part of the Services, without the express written consent of Kubient and compensation to Kubient under the applicable exhibit and/or schedule. Provided however, this provision shall not apply in the event Customer can establish, in writing, that it had a preexisting working relationship with such Third-Party prior to the Agreement and without Kubient's assistance. Customer acknowledges that this provision is reasonable and necessary for the protection of Kubient and that Kubient will be irrevocably damaged if such covenant is not specifically enforced. Customer further agrees that Kubient will be entitled to seek injunctive relief for the purpose of restraining Customer from violating this covenant (and no bond or other security shall be required in connection therewith) in addition to any other relief to which Kubient may be entitled under the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The clause regarding non-circumvention is weakened by negating the requirement for express written consent or compensation. This change creates a contradiction; the customer agrees not to work with third parties introduced by Kubient, but the exception negates this agreement by allowing such work without consent or compensation. This makes the non-circumvention clause difficult to enforce.",

During the Term and any renewal terms of the Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year following the expiration or earlier termination thereof, Customer shall not, whether for its own account or for the account of any other person or entity, interfere with the relationship of Kubient with, or endeavor to entice away from Kubient, any person or entity who was or is a an employee or Third-Party of Kubient.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'However, this does not apply to general job postings accessible to the public' to the non-solicitation clause, the clause becomes contradictory. While the customer agrees not to solicit Kubient's employees, the exception allows them to effectively do so through public job postings, thereby weakening the protection offered to Kubient. It makes enforcement harder as the line blurs between soliciting and general hiring practices.",

If PB fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date therefore, then, without prejudice to any other remedies that SFJ may have, that amount will bear interest from the due date until payment of such amount is made, both before and after any judgment, at a rate equal to, [***] percent ([***]%) per annum computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days payment is delinquent or if such rate exceeds the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, at such maximum rate.",
                "changed_text": "6.4 Late Payments. If PB fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date therefore, then, without prejudice to any other remedies that SFJ may have, that amount *may* bear interest from the due date until payment of such amount is made, both before and after any judgment, at a rate to be determined at the discretion of SFJ, not to exceed [***] percent ([***]%) per annum computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days payment is delinquent or if such rate exceeds the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, at such maximum rate.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'will' to 'may' and adding discretion to SFJ significantly weakens the enforceability of the late payment interest clause. It creates ambiguity about whether interest *will* actually be charged, making the original clause's obligation uncertain.",

The arbitrators shall have no power or authority, under the ICDR rules and procedures or otherwise, to relieve the Parties from their agreement hereunder to arbitrate or otherwise to amend or disregard any provision of this Agreement.

                "explanation": "Changing this makes the term less clear about who is going to pay the cost. The original phrase 'borne by the Party the arbitrator determines has not prevailed' provides a definite side that bears the cost, while changing this to 'shall be borne equally' is significantly different because there is now a financial impact for both parties, and not just one.",

                "original_text": "15.13 Relationship of the Parties.\n\n15.13.1 Independent Contractors. Nothing contained herein will be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture, or similar relationship between the Parties, including for tax purposes. Neither Party is the agent, employee, joint venturer, partner, franchisee, or representative of the other Party. Each Party specifically acknowledges that it does not have the authority to, and will not, incur any obligations or responsibilities on behalf of the other Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party (and its officers, directors, agents, employees, and members) will not hold themselves out as employees, agents,\nrepresentatives, or franchisees of the other Party or enter into any agreements on such Party's behalf.",
                "changed_text": "1.1.202 \"Vendor(s)\" has the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 2.4.2.\n\n1.2 Construction. For purposes of this Agreement: (1) words in the singular will be held to include the plural and vice versa as the context requires; (2) the words \"including\" and \"include\" will mean \"including, without limitation,\" unless otherwise specified; (3) the terms \"hereof,\" \"herein,\" \"herewith,\" and \"hereunder,\" and words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; and (4) all references to \"Section\" and \"Exhibit,\" unless otherwise specified, are intended to refer to a Section or Exhibit of or to this Agreement.\n\n1.  5   3   Relationship of the Parties.\n\n1.  5   4 Independent Contractors. Nothing contained herein will be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture, or similar relationship between the Parties, including for tax purposes. However, in certain cases, both parties might be considered franchisees of each other. In such events both parties shall incur obligations and responsibilities on behalf of the other Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party (and its officers, directors, agents, employees, and members) will not hold themselves out as employees, agents\nrepresentatives, or franchisees of the other Party or enter into any agreements on such Party's behalf.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces an internal contradiction regarding the relationship between the parties. Initially, the section asserts that nothing creates a partnership or similar relationship. Then, it states that in certain cases, both parties might be considered franchisees of each other. The statement that in such events both parties shall incur obligations and responsibilities on behalf of the other Party directly contradicts the intention of this section, it reduces clarity and makes it difficult to enforce.",

SFJ hereby represents, warrants and covenants that it will have, as and when needed, sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations hereunder. Further, SFJ will have Commercially Reasonable Practices, meaning with respect to the performance of activities under this Agreement by a Party (as pertains to its role in conducting the Clinical Trials): un reasonable and diligent efforts.",
                "explanation": "By modifying the definition of Commercially Reasonable Efforts and misplacing it under SFJ Representation, Warranty and Covenant, it makes it difficult to enforce the original intent of the term. This significantly affects the clarity of obligations, and potentially protects the SFJ from breaches of contract. This relocation reduces the enforceability and clarity of what constitutes acceptable effort.",

                "explanation": "By adding a conditional statement, it introduces uncertainty and weakens the cumulative nature of the remedies originally intended. The addition \"If SFJ breaches the agreement remedies will be in addition to remedies provided for this Agreement\" creates contradiction - this phrase is redundant, as the original terms outline cumulative remedies for ALL parties. This undermines enforceability by suggesting that remedies are not cumulative by default.",

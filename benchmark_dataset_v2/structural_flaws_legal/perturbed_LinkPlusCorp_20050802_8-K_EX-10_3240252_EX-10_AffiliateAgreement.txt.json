                "original_text": "7.2 All actions, cases, suits and proceedings in connection with this Agreement shall be brought in Maryland. All persons affected by this Agreement specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts. No action, case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen, or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the date of the last payment. ALL ACTIONS, CASES, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE HEARD WITHOUT A JURY. ALL PERSONS AFFECTED BY THIS AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND SPECIFICALLY CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN SAID COURTS.",
                "changed_text": "7.2 All actions, cases, suits and proceedings in connection with this Agreement shall be brought in Maryland. All persons affected by this Agreement specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts. No action, case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen, or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the date of the last payment. ALL PERSONS AFFECTED BY THIS AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND SPECIFICALLY CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN SAID COURTS. However, the parties can mutually agree to bring a suit to a different state.",
                "explanation": "The last sentence in section 7.2 allows for a mutual agreement to bring a suit to a different state, contradicting the previous statements that all actions should be brought in Maryland, creating ambiguity and uncertainty. The clarity and enforceability of the original clause about the jurisdiction requirements has now been diminished.",

                "explanation": "The phrase \"but the parties can negotiate the breach on a case by case basis\" introduces a contradiction by undermining the preceding statement that non-payment after sixty days constitutes a material breach, weakening the enforceability of the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The changed text states that the agreement will remain in force for perpetuity unless Axiometric terminates without LKPL approval, which introduces a contradiction. The original text implies that both parties need to come to an agreement in order for termination to occur. This creates ambiguity on how termination should occur, and thus the term is now not as enforceable. ",

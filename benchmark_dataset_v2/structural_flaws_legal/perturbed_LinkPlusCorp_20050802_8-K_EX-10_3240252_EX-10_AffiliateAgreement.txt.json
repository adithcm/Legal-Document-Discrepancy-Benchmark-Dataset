All persons                   affected by this Agreement specifically consent to the                   personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts. No action,                   case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of                   or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party                   more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen,                   or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the                   date of the last payment. ALL ACTIONS, CASES, SUITS AND                   PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE HEARD WITHOUT A JURY. ALL PERSONS                   AFFECTED BY THIS AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A                   TRIAL BY JURY AND SPECIFICALLY CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL                   JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN SAID COURTS.",
                "changed_text": "All actions, cases, suits and proceedings in connection with                   this Agreement may be brought in a location convenient to Link Plus Corporation, as determined by Link Plus Corporation. All persons                   affected by this Agreement specifically consent to the                   personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts. No action,                   case, suit or proceeding, regardless of form, arising out of                   or related to this Agreement, may be brought by either party                   more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen,                   or in the case of nonpayment, more than two (2) years from the                   date of the last payment. Actions, cases, suits and proceedings may be heard with or without a jury, depending on the preference of Link Plus Corporation. All persons                   affected by this Agreement may or may not waive all rights to a trial by jury and may or may not consent to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in said courts.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and contradiction by stating that actions may be brought in a location convenient to Link Plus Corporation, contradicting the original clause mandating Maryland as the jurisdiction. Furthermore, the explicit waiver of the right to a jury trial and the consent to jurisdiction are made optional, undermining the enforceability of these provisions. It contradicts the purpose of jurisdiction clause that is designed to provide certainty and predictability in the event of a dispute.",

                "changed_text": "Payments that are not received within sixty (60) days after their due date may, at the discretion of the paying party, be considered a material breach of this Agreement, but the party due payment may only pursue legal action with the express written consent of the paying party. The recovery of reasonable legal fees is subject to further negotiation and agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by giving the paying party the discretion to determine if a late payment constitutes a breach and requiring their consent for legal action, effectively nullifying the original clause's protection for the receiving party. It also limits the ability to recover reasonable legal fees, making it difficult to ensure compliance. It undermines the payment enforcement and protection for the payee.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by stating that the agreement will remain in force as long as Link Plus Corporation deems it beneficial, effectively overriding the perpetuity clause and giving Link Plus Corporation unilateral termination rights. It conflicts with the principle of mutual agreement in contract termination and creates uncertainty for Axiometric. The addition of a unilateral termination clause contradicts the original intent of the clause, potentially leading to disputes.",

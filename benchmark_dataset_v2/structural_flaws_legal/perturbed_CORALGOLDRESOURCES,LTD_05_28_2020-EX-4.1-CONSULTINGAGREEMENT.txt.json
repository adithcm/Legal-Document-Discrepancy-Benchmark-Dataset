                "original_text": "18. GOVERNING LAWS\n\n18.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, and the parties hereto submit and attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of British Columbia.",
                "changed_text": "18. GOVERNING LAWS\n\n18.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties and following the execution of any and all other clauses in this agreement, the Agreement shall be governed by whatever laws the consultant deems necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that British Columbia and Canadian federal laws govern the agreement. The modified version contradicts this by stating that governing laws will be determined by the consultant. This creates a legal contradiction because it allows for potentially any jurisdiction's laws to apply, undermining the initially agreed-upon legal framework. This introduces uncertainty and reduces the enforceability of the agreement under British Columbia law.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless authorized to do so by any other agreement' creates a significant loophole in the confidentiality clause. This allows the consultant to bypass the confidentiality obligations outlined in this agreement if another agreement exists, even if that agreement is vague or ill-defined. This introduces a legal contradiction because it weakens the explicit confidentiality provisions of this contract, making it more difficult for the Company to protect its confidential information.",

GOVERNING LAWS 18.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, and the parties hereto submit and attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of British Columbia.",

WAIVER 17.1 Any waiver of any breach or default under this Agreement shall only be effective if in writing signed by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced, and no waiver shall be implied by indulgence, delay or other act, omission or conduct. Any waiver shall only apply to the specific matter waived and only in the specific instance i n which it is waived. 18. GOVERNING LAWS 18.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties and Intermark Capital Corp., the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of a Province and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, and the parties hereto submit and attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province. The Province will be mutually agreed upon by both parties.",
                "explanation": "Altering 'the laws of the Province of British Columbia' to 'a Province mutually agreed upon' introduces ambiguity and contradiction. The original clause provides a clear jurisdiction, while the altered clause leaves the jurisdiction undetermined, potentially leading to disputes over which laws apply. This also could be deemed unenforceable as the parties can't avoid the laws applicable to the location of the actual performance of the contract.",

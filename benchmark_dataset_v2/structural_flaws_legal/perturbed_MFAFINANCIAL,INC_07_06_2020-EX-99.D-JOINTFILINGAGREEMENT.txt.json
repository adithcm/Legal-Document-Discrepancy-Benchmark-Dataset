                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states the agreement is 'in accordance with' SEC Rule 13d-1(k) and will be included as an exhibit. The modified version introduces uncertainty and contradiction by stating that the agreement is 'subject to mutual agreement' and may not always be included as an exhibit, directly contradicting the mandatory nature implied by referencing the SEC rule.",

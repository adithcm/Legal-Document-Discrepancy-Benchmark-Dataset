The Remarketing Agent shall not act as an underwriter for the Tendered VRRM- MFP Shares and shall in no way be obligated to advance its own funds to purchase any Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares (except as provided in Section 2(c) or to the extent that in its individual capacity as purchaser of those VRRM-MFP Shares it may elect, in accordance with Section 6 hereof, to purchase, in its sole discretion) or to otherwise expend or risk its own funds or incur or become exposed to financial liability in the performance of its duties hereunder. Section 9. Indemnification.

                "changed_text": "Royalty payments shall be paid annually within ninety (180) days following the close of the calendar year.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment terms to be annually and within 180 days directly contradicts standard business practice that suggests payments should be paid quarterly, at the minimum, and also goes against accounting standards and practices that suggest annual reconciliation",

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice to 5 days and limiting the inspection time to a one-hour window imposes an unreasonably short timeframe for the Licensee to prepare for and accommodate an audit.  Most companies need ample time to compile data for an audit. This is contradictory to generally accepted auditing principles that ensure reasonable access and preparation time.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 15 days is an unreasonable short amount of time. Also, this short amount of time contradicts generally accepted contract law principles that allow reasonable time for remedies.",

                "explanation": "California Labor Code Section 201 and 202 requires prompt payment of wages, but not more than the next regular payday. Setting a 60-day payment term, which is far beyond the next regular payday, is likely to violate California labor laws regarding timely wage payments for an independent contractor.",

                "original_text": "From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates.",

                "explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally invalidates non-compete agreements. While non-solicitation agreements are more likely to be upheld, a 24-month restriction, especially in a rapidly evolving field, could be deemed unreasonable and therefore unenforceable under California law as an unlawful restraint of trade. California courts scrutinize the reasonableness of such restrictions.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of law principles of California or any other jurisdiction.",
                "explanation": "Although parties can agree to a choice of law, if the application of Delaware law would deprive the consultant of protections afforded by California law, particularly concerning wage payment and non-compete restrictions that are strongly protected by California public policy, a California court might refuse to enforce the Delaware choice of law provision. The change introduces a potential conflict because California has a strong public policy against certain restrictive covenants and in favor of prompt wage payment, and applying Delaware law could undermine these policies.",

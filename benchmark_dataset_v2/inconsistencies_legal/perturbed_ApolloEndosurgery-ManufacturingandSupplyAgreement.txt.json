                "original_text": "APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within ten (10) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this ten (10) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection and rejection period to 10 days may be unreasonably short, especially for complex medical devices, and could be deemed unconscionable or violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the product. It does not give APOLLO ample time to detect any manufacturing defects which could be harmful.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, potential violation of UCC provisions regarding reasonable time for inspection and rejection (UCC 2-602, 2-606, 2-607) depending on jurisdiction.",

                "changed_text": "Establishment shall retain such records for two (2) years following the date of manufacture, or such longer period of time if consistent with Regulatory Standards, and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment shall contact Apollo and give Apollo the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo or destroyed.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to two years may violate FDA regulations and ISO 13485 standards which often require longer retention periods for medical device manufacturing records. This also reduces the length of time APOLLO can access the records, hindering auditing.",

The evidence will (a) indicate that the policy will not change or terminate without at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to APOLLO, (b) APOLLO shall be listed as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for insurance policy changes or termination to five days is insufficient time for APOLLO to secure alternative coverage or assess the risk implications. This may violate standard business practices and could be deemed a breach of the duty of good faith. It potentially leaves APOLLO at risk if ESTABLISHMENT fails to maintain adequate insurance.",

                "original_text": "APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications.",
                "changed_text": "APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within ten (10) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this ten (10) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection period to 10 days is unreasonable and may violate implied warranty laws under the UCC, which require a reasonable time for inspection. This change creates a non-compliance issue as it may not provide sufficient time for APOLLO to thoroughly inspect the goods, potentially waiving their right to reject defective products.",

                "original_text": "Each Party's agreement to indemnify, defend and hold the other harmless is conditioned on the indemnified Party (i) providing written notice to the indemnifying Party of any claim, demand or action arising out of the indemnified activities within thirty (30) days after the indemnified Party has knowledge of such claim, demand or action; (ii) permitting the indemnifying Party to assume full responsibility to investigate, prepare for and defend against any such claim or demand; (iii) assisting the indemnifying Party, at the indemnifying Party's reasonable expense, in the investigation of, preparation for and defense of any such claim or demand; and (iv) not compromising or settling such claim or demand without the indemnifying Party's written consent; provided, however, that the failure of the indemnified Party to undertake any of the foregoing actions shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of any obligation it may have under this Article 8, except to the extent that the indemnifying Party's ability to fulfill such obligation has been materially prejudiced thereby.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party's agreement to indemnify, defend and hold the other harmless is conditioned on the indemnified Party (i) providing written notice to the indemnifying Party of any claim, demand or action arising out of the indemnified activities within five (5) days after the indemnified Party has knowledge of such claim, demand or action; (ii) permitting the indemnifying Party to assume full responsibility to investigate, prepare for and defend against any such claim or demand; (iii) assisting the indemnifying Party, at the indemnifying Party's reasonable expense, in the investigation of, preparation for and defense of any such claim or demand; and (iv) not compromising or settling such claim or demand without the indemnifying Party's written consent; provided, however, that the failure of the indemnified Party to undertake any of the foregoing actions shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of any obligation it may have under this Article 8, except to the extent that the indemnifying Party's ability to fulfill such obligation has been materially prejudiced thereby.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for indemnification claims to 5 days is likely to be considered an unreasonably short timeframe. This could be deemed unconscionable under contract law, particularly if the claim involves complex issues requiring more time to investigate and assess. This creates non-compliance by potentially depriving the indemnified party of a fair opportunity to notify the indemnifying party.",

                "changed_text": "Establishment shall retain such records for two (2) years following the date of manufacture and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment may automatically destroy the quality control documentation without notifying Apollo.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to two years contradicts FDA requirements for medical device manufacturers, which typically require longer retention periods (e.g., the expected life of the device or a defined period after its distribution). Furthermore, allowing ESTABLISHMENT to destroy records without notifying APOLLO impedes APOLLO's ability to comply with post-market surveillance and reporting obligations, potentially violating federal regulations.",

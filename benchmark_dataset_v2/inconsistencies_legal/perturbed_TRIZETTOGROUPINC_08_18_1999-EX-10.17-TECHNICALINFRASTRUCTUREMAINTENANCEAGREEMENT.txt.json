                "original_text": "Charges will be invoiced and are payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on thirty days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",
                "changed_text": "Charges will be invoiced and are payable within sixty (60) days after the date of the invoice. All charges are subject to change by MMMW for the forthcoming period capped at the CPI annually, on ten days written notice. MMMW reserves the right to apply [*] finance charges.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict because while a 30-day payment window is generally acceptable, reducing the advance notice for charge changes to 'ten days' may be non-compliant with commercial and fair practice laws, which usually require a more reasonable notification period (typically 30 days or more) for significant changes in financial terms. This depends on Indiana state law (where the agreement is interpreted) regarding fair business practices and notice periods for contractual modifications. While the original text gave 30 days' notice, the edited version gives only 10 days' notice for charge changes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Indiana's Deceptive Consumer Sales Act or common law principles requiring reasonable notice for changes to contractual terms, depending on how 'significant' the charge change is deemed to be.",

                "explanation": "This change reduces the statute of limitations for claims arising from the agreement to one year.  In Indiana, the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims is generally longer than one year (often six years for oral contracts and ten years for written contracts). This contractual reduction of the statute of limitations could be deemed unenforceable if it unreasonably shortens the time available for a party to pursue a valid claim, conflicting with Indiana law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Indiana statutes of limitations for contract claims (e.g., I.C. 34-11-2-7 for written contracts) if a 1-year limitation is deemed unreasonably short and against public policy.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cancellation notice period to fourteen days might be considered unreasonable, especially considering the complexities of technical infrastructure agreements. A more extended period is generally needed to find alternative support, which might be considered an unfair practice under consumer protection or contract law. This is dependent on Indiana state law and whether 14 days is deemed sufficient for the nature of this contract.",

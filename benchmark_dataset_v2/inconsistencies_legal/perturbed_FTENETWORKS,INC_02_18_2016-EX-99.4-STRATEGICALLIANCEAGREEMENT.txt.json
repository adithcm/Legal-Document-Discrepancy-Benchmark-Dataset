                "original_text": "Subcontractor agrees to indemnify and defend EDGE from and against any lien claims and to discharge any lien or furnish an indemnity bond equal to the lien amount (or any greater amount required by law) within ten (10) days notice from EDGE of the presence of any lien.",

                "explanation": "Texas law (and most states) provides more than two days to respond to a lien notice. Reducing the response time to two days creates a contradiction and places an unreasonable burden on the subcontractor, potentially violating due process.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to five days may conflict with Texas law regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure, especially for complex construction or service contracts.

                "explanation": "Texas law, particularly in legal contexts, typically requires a reasonable period for notice to be considered effective, accounting for potential delays in delivery. Eliminating the 'actually received or seventy-two (72) hours' clause and stating that notice is effective immediately upon sending is legally problematic. Certified or registered mail has a tracking period, and the law does not allow the elimination of time to receive. This creates a conflict with standard legal practices.",

                "original_text": "No later than [***] ([***]) Business Days following the end of each month during the Term, Company shall report to Janssen the number of Details performed (and any other information necessary to determine whether the requirements set forth in Section 3.2.2 and Exhibit B have been satisfied) during such month by the Sales Representatives in accordance with this Agreement and the Call Plan, as reported by the Company Internal Detail Reporting System.",

The report must be submitted within 30 business days.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the reporting deadline to 30 business days. This may conflict with internal deadlines for accurate, monthly, real-time sales data used for decision-making, thus creating operational inconsistencies. Additionally, the modification requires the data be from the Sales Reps and not an internal reporting system which may not be legally sufficient for compliance purposes.",

                "explanation": "Extending the deadline for delivering the Fee Notice to 60 days could potentially contradict regulations requiring timely and accurate financial reporting, especially if quicker payments or reconciliations are mandated by law or other agreements.",

                "original_text": "PaperExchange shall then have three business days after receipt of such notice to (a) accept or reject such advertiser, in its reasonable business discretion, and (b) notify VerticalNet of its decision. If, at the end of such three-day period, PaperExchange has not responded to such notice, PaperExchange shall be deemed to have accepted such advertiser.",

If, at the end of such one-day period, PaperExchange has not responded to such notice, PaperExchange shall be deemed to have accepted such advertiser.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the response time for accepting or rejecting advertisers to one business day may be deemed unreasonably short, especially given the need for due diligence and internal consultations. This could be seen as an unfair business practice and potentially violate regulations related to fair contracting and business dealings, especially where PaperExchange might require more time to properly vet potential advertisers.",

Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",

Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such one business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the approval/disapproval timeframe for advertising materials to one business day puts undue pressure on the Receiving Party. This is an unreasonably short period that may hinder proper review. Such a compressed timeline could raise concerns about fair dealing and potentially violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the audit period to 6 months may be considered an unreasonably short timeframe to allow for proper financial review and could potentially contradict accepted accounting practices or regulations that recommend a longer period for audit rights, especially in complex financial relationships. This may be seen as restricting the ability of the Auditing Party to fully assess the financial accuracy of the payments, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and transparency in contractual relationships.",

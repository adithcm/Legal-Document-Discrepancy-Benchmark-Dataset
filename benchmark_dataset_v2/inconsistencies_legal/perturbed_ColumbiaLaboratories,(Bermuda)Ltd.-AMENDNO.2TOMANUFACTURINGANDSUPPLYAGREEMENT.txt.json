                "original_text": "Claims relating to quantity, weight and loss or damage to any Product sold under this Agreement shall be waived by Columbia unless made within [***] of receipt of Product by Columbia.",
                "changed_text": "Claims relating to quantity, weight and loss or damage to any Product sold under this Agreement shall be waived by Columbia unless made within 24 hours of receipt of Product by Columbia.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the claim window to 24 hours is unreasonably short and likely contradicts standard commercial practices and potentially applicable sale of goods laws. A reasonable timeframe is typically required to allow for proper inspection and assessment of damages. This creates an unfair and likely unenforceable term.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 90 days without specifying interest may violate UK Late Payment legislation. UK law sets specific guidelines for payment terms and the right to claim statutory interest for late payments, particularly for smaller businesses. This delay without addressing interest conflicts with these regulations.",

Each Party shall guard such Confidential Information using the same degree of care as it normally uses to guard its own confidential, proprietary information of like importance, but in any event no less than reasonable care.",

Each Party shall guard such Confidential Information using the same degree of care as it normally uses to guard its own confidential, proprietary information of like importance, but in any event no less than minimal care.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year for proprietary information and lowering the required standard of care to 'minimal care' could be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under UK law. Courts typically expect a reasonable period for confidentiality and a standard of care consistent with protecting commercially sensitive information. Such a drastic reduction may be seen as unconscionable.",

                "original_text": "In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice period.",
                "changed_text": "In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within ten (10) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within five (5) days of the end of such ten (10) date notice period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for reporting nonconformities and returning products places an unreasonable burden on the Manufacturer and contradicts general commercial reasonableness standards, potentially violating implied warranties or consumer protection laws depending on the end-use of the product. The reduction in days could violate the implied warranty of merchantability requiring reasonable time to inspect goods.",

                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to ten years may be deemed unreasonable and an unlawful restraint of trade, particularly in Arizona where the agreement is governed. Courts often scrutinize non-solicitation agreements to ensure they are not overly broad or burdensome, and a ten-year restriction may be considered excessive and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By extending the payment dates significantly and unilaterally favoring the Manufacturer, this could potentially conflict with state-specific prompt payment laws for commercial transactions. If Subcontractor is a small business, this may violate laws designed to protect them from delayed payments, depending on the state's specific regulations.",

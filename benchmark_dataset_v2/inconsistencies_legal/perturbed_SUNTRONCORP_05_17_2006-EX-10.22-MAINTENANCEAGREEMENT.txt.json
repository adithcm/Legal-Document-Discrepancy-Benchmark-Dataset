The Required Capital Contributions shall be made within ninety (90) days following the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, regardless of the fiscal year end. The Required Capital Contributions for the last Fiscal Quarter of the fiscal year end shall be made within one hundred eighty (180) days following such fiscal year end.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential conflict with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and SEC regulations for publicly traded companies (if Suntron Corporation is publicly traded or subject to SEC reporting requirements). GAAP and SEC regulations mandate timely and accurate financial reporting, and extending the deadline for capital contributions related to financial performance significantly beyond standard reporting timelines (e.g., 90 days for year-end) could violate those requirements. The longer period could obscure the true financial picture of the company during the standard reporting period.",

                "explanation": "The modifications to clauses (a) and (b) significantly shorten the cure periods for defaults, potentially conflicting with standard commercial law principles of reasonableness and good faith. While Minnesota law (governing law per Section 15) allows parties to define default terms, excessively short cure periods, especially for complex financial transactions, may be deemed unconscionable or a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Courts may find that a 2-day or 5-day cure period is insufficient for a party to rectify a complex financial obligation, making the default provision potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates an issue of unequal bargaining power and potential unconscionability in the jury trial waiver. By stating that only the INVESTOR waives their right to a jury trial, while explicitly reserving that right for the Agent and Lenders, the agreement creates a situation where one party is significantly disadvantaged in potential litigation. While jury trial waivers are generally enforceable, courts scrutinize them closely for fairness and voluntariness. This clause's asymmetrical nature could be seen as evidence of coercion or undue influence, making the waiver potentially unenforceable against the Investor under Minnesota law.",

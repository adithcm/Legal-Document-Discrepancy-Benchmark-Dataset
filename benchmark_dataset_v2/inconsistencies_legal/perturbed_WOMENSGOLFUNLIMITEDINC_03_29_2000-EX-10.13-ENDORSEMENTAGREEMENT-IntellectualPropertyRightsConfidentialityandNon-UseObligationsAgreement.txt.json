                "explanation": "This modification introduces a potential conflict with trade secret laws. While the original text requires the return of confidential information upon demand or completion of work, the modified text imposes a 180-day time limit on the Company's ability to demand the return of information. If the Company fails to make the demand within this timeframe, the Recipient is no longer obligated to return the information. This could jeopardize trade secret protection, as a delay in demanding the return of information could be interpreted as a waiver of rights, potentially undermining the confidentiality and trade secret status of the information under both state and federal laws.",

Accordingly, Recipient hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey and agrees that the Company may seek temporary restraining orders against it or other extraordinary relief necessary to protect the Information.",

The Recipient consents to the jurisdiction of only the County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey, and agrees that the Company may seek arbitration but will be only be awarded a maximum of $5,000 if the Recipient violates the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change limits the venue for dispute resolution. The original text allows the Company to seek remedies in both Federal and County Courts in Essex County, New Jersey. The modified text removes the Federal court option, restricting the Company's legal recourse solely to the County Courts. It also limits the relief to Arbitration, and sets a maximum award of $5,000, regardless of the damages actually sustained by the Company. This conflicts with the standard principles of contract law, where remedies should be commensurate with the actual damages incurred and the right to pursue legal action in multiple venues can be a right.",

                "explanation": "This modification undermines the 'work for hire' doctrine. The original text states unequivocally that intellectual property developed by the Recipient during her work for the Company is the exclusive property of the Company and is considered a 'work for hire.' The modified text introduces a condition that makes it all conditional, meaning she must consent for the company to take ownership of her work. This creates ambiguity and potential unenforceability under copyright law, which requires a clear and unambiguous assignment of rights for 'work for hire' arrangements.",

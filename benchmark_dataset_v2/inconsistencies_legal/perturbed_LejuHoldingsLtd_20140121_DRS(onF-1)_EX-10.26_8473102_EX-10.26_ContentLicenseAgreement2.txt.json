                "explanation": "Changing the governing law from the PRC to the United States introduces a legal contradiction. Many provisions valid and enforceable under PRC law may not be so under US law, and vice versa, leading to uncertainty and potential unenforceability. The contract was originally under PRC law; changing it to US law without adjustments will create legal conflicts and invalidate provisions that were legal under the PRC's legal system.",

Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, upon the date of execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination.",
                "changed_text": "1. Beijing SINA and SINA Leju agree that, 180 days after the execution of this Termination Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and, for the avoidance of doubt, all provisions of the Original Agreement survive such termination until that date.",
                "explanation": "By changing the termination date to 180 days after execution but retaining the agreement's effect until then, while stating all provisions survive, a contradiction is created. The original agreement is terminated on execution but its effects remain for 6 months after this. If the termination is subject to conditions which may not materialize for 180 days, there needs to be legal ground.",

                "changed_text": "2. This Termination Agreement represents the complete agreement, but it can be modified verbally by mutual agreement of the parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires written modifications. The change allows verbal modifications, contradicting standard contract law principles requiring written modifications for agreements with integration clauses, especially when significant value or complexity is involved. Verbal modifications are less legally defensible than the provisions requiring modifications in writing and signed by the relevant parties.",

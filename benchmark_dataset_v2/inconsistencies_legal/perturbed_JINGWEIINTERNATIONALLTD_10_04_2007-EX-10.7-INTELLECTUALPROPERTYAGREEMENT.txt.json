                "changed_text": "Without prejudice to any legal or other rights or remedies of the party who asks for termination of this Agreement, any Party has the right to terminate this Agreement immediately with written notice to the other party in the event the other party materially breaches this Agreement including but not limited to the obligation under Article 3 of this Agreement and fails to cure its breach within ten (10) days from the date it receives written notice of its breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a 30-day cure period for breaches. Reducing this to 10 days may be inconsistent with laws or regulations in PRC that require a reasonable cure period, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline to June 1st each year accelerates the payment schedule significantly. While seemingly innocuous, if this change places an undue burden on Party B and disrupts normal business operations or financial planning, it could be argued as an unreasonable term under PRC contract law, especially if there's no corresponding benefit or consideration given to Party B.",

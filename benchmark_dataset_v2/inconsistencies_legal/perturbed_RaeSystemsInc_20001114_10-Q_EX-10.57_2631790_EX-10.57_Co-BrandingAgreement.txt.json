                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within seven (7) days of receipt of notice.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written demand of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall cease using the Confidential Information and return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the Disclosing Party within two (2) days of receipt of notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Receiving Party to return confidential information within seven days of notice. This has been changed to two days, which may be unreasonably short and could be deemed insufficient time to comply with the request, especially considering the volume or complexity of the information. This creates a potential legal challenge to the enforceability of this clause as California law favors reasonable notice and opportunity to comply with contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "The parties shall make such payments within sixty (60) days of the end of each calendar quarter for the Advertising Revenue invoiced during such calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "The change extends the payment timeline from 30 to 60 days which might violate California Prompt Payment laws. While this section of the agreement does not explicitly qualify as a construction or public works contract where these laws are most commonly applied, delayed payment terms can be scrutinized under general contract law principles relating to good faith and fair dealing, particularly if such delay causes financial hardship to the receiving party.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Prompt Payment Laws (potentially applicable under broader contractual interpretation)",

                "changed_text": "Audit Rights. SpinRecords.com shall maintain for a period of one (1) year after the end of the year to which they pertain, complete records of it's customers in order to calculate and confirm SpinRecords.com's obligations hereunder.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period from two years to one year could be problematic. In California, the statute of limitations for breach of written contract is four years. By limiting the availability of records to one year, NETTAXI's ability to effectively audit and pursue legal action for potential breaches related to payment obligations is significantly hampered. This could be viewed as an unreasonable restriction that undermines the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law.",

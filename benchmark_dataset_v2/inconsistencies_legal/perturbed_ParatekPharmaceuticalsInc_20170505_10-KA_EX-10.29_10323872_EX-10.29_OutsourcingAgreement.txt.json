In the event that Customer is of the opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer shall, within [* * *] after the date of physical receipt of Product, provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a \"Notice of Rejection\"), which shall include a description of the grounds for rejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification Product which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of Rejection shall be provided to Supplier not later than [* * *].",

In the event that Customer is of the opinion that the Product is Out Of Specification at the time of delivery, Customer must provide Supplier with a written notice to reject the Product (a \"Notice of Rejection\") immediately, but no later than 24 hours after the date of physical receipt of Product, which shall include a description of the grounds for rejection and copies of test reports and testing methodology conducted on the Product, if any. However, with respect to any Out Of Specification Product which would not be apparent from a reasonable visual inspection on delivery, including in the case of any hidden defects, such Notice of Rejection shall be provided to Supplier immediately.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a reasonable period for inspection and notice of rejection. The modified text demands immediate notification, effectively shortening the time to a potentially impossible timeframe of 24 hours. This is an unreasonable restriction and contradicts the general principle of providing a reasonable timeframe for inspection and notification in commercial contracts, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under US contract law. Also, it changes the timeframe for reporting hidden defects to immediately which is not reasonable and gives undue advantage to the supplier.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within a reasonable timeframe after the invoice date, contingent upon the Customer's lack of a good-faith dispute. The modified text mandates payment within 60 days regardless of any legitimate dispute. This violates fundamental principles of contract law, which grants the customer the right to withhold payment of legitimately disputed invoices.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates record retention for a reasonable period to ensure compliance and verifiability. The modified text truncates this period to a mere 6 months. Per regulations such as FDA requirements, records for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products must be maintained for a much longer period to ensure traceability and regulatory compliance. Shortening the retention period to six months will make it non-compliant with regulatory requirements.",

                "original_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall          continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to          annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual          expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent          shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least          thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "changed_text": "11. The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall          continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to          annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual          expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent          shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least          ten (10) days prior to the desired date of termination.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement requires a 30-day notice for termination. Changing this to 10 days could be problematic under New Jersey law (where mPhase is located) if it's deemed unreasonably short, particularly if it significantly disadvantages one party or contradicts industry standards for similar agreements. A shorter notice period may not allow sufficient time for the other party to make necessary adjustments, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "changed_text": "8.       If Lucent determines that mPhase's Goods are no longer maintained at          the current level of quality, Lucent shall immediately terminate this Agreement without any prior written notification to mPhase.",
                "explanation": "By removing the written notification requirement before termination, Lucent can immediately terminate the contract based solely on their determination of quality, potentially violating New Jersey's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it does not allow the other party the right to cure any quality deficiencies.",

                "explanation": "This change attempts to supersede the applicability of any state or federal law, including New York law, and replace it with Lucent's internal policies. This is legally problematic because parties cannot contract out of mandatory legal requirements. This violates fundamental contract law principles in both New Jersey and New York and would likely be deemed unenforceable.",

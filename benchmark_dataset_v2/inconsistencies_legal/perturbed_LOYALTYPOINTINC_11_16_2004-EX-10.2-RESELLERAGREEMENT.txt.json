                "original_text": "Schoolpop shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws concerning the use of Cards, including anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, and currency control regulations. Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to track information about its Clients which shall meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7) years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Schoolpop shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws concerning the use of Cards, including anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, and currency control regulations. Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to track information about its Clients which shall meet compliance requirements related to the above stated laws, track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain appropriate records for its Clients for a period of two (2) years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request and subject to applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the record-keeping period from seven years to two years post-termination. This could violate federal regulations, such as those under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which may require financial institutions (or entities functioning as such) to retain certain records for five years or more.",

                "explanation": "Lengthening the review period from seven business days to fourteen business days may unduly delay Schoolpop's marketing efforts and ability to comply with time-sensitive promotional opportunities. This could be deemed unreasonable or unconscionable depending on state-specific contract law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the sell-off period from three months to one month following termination may not provide Schoolpop with a reasonable opportunity to liquidate its existing card inventory. If the termination is not due to Schoolpop's breach, this change may be considered an unreasonable restriction on Schoolpop's ability to mitigate losses, potentially conflicting with state-specific contract law principles regarding fair dealing and reasonable business practices.",

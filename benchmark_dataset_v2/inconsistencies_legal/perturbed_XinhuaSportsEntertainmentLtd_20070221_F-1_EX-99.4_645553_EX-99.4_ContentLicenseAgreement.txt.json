Any notice, demand or other communication so addressed to the\n     relevant Party shall be deemed to have been delivered (a) if given or made\n     by letter by hand, when actually delivered to the relevant address against\n     receipt; (b) if given or made by letter by post, two business days after\n     posting; and (c) if given or made by fax, when dispatched and received in\n     good order.",

                "original_text": "Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 60 days, which is a standard timeframe. By extending it to 90 days, we create potential cash flow issues for the supplier (Manufacturer). While not inherently illegal, it can be considered an unreasonably long payment term, particularly for smaller businesses, and could be challenged under general principles of fairness and good faith, especially if the manufacturer is based in a jurisdiction with prompt payment laws (though this requires further jurisdictional information to confirm).",

                "changed_text": "If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within sixty (60) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the \"Late Payment Date\"), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) , and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.",
                "explanation": "By extending the 'Late Payment Date' to sixty (60) days, it delays the application of interest on overdue amounts, which, while not strictly illegal, could be viewed as unreasonable, especially for smaller suppliers. Additionally, setting the interest rate to 'ten percent (10%)' may exceed usury laws in some jurisdictions, creating a conflict with regulatory limits on interest rates.",

Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute.",

If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it may withhold the entire payment without notifying Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Customer may extend payments with no interest.",
                "explanation": "The modified text allows the customer to withhold payment on the entire invoice if any portion is disputed, and removes the requirement to notify the manufacturer of the dispute. This violates commercial norms and could violate prompt payment laws. Moreover, unilaterally waiving the right to charge interest on late payments is unusually favorable to the Customer and conflicts with standard contract practices and potentially state laws governing payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates general principles of good faith and fair dealing, potentially contradicts prompt payment laws, and unfairly favors the Customer.",

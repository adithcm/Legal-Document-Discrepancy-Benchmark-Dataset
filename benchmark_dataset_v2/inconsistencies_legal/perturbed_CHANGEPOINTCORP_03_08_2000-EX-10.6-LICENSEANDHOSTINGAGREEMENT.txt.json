                "original_text": "Within one hundred twenty (120) days after delivery of the Software, Corio shall test the Software for conformance with the Documentation (\"Acceptance Test\"). If the Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation, then Corio shall notify Changepoint in writing of its acceptance of the Software. In the event Corio finds material errors or defects with the Software, Corio shall notify Changepoint in writing of such errors or defects and provide adequate detail to facilitate Changepoint replicating the error or defect. Upon receipt of written notice, Changepoint shall have fifteen (15) days to correct the defect, reinstall the Software at the Corio site and re-perform the Acceptance Test.",
                "changed_text": "Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Software, Corio shall test the Software for conformance with the Documentation (\"Acceptance Test\"). If the Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation, then Corio shall notify Changepoint in writing of its acceptance of the Software. In the event Corio finds material errors or defects with the Software, Corio shall notify Changepoint in writing of such errors or defects and provide adequate detail to facilitate Changepoint replicating the error or defect. Upon receipt of written notice, Changepoint shall have seventy five (75) days to correct the defect, reinstall the Software at the Corio site and re-perform the Acceptance Test.",
                "explanation": "The original contract text provided 120 days for the Acceptance Test. The modified version reduces this timeframe to 30 days, which may be insufficient for complex software testing, potentially leading to premature acceptance or disputes. The modified text provides Changepoint seventy five (75) days to correct the defect. Which is an unreasonable amount of time and could be considered a breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "In the event any payment by Corio under this Agreement is not made within thirty (30) calendar days of its due date, interest on any such unpaid amount shall accrue at a rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "In the event any payment by Corio under this Agreement is not made within ten (10) calendar days of its due date, interest on any such unpaid amount shall accrue at a rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per annum, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "Many states have usury laws that limit the maximum interest rate that can be charged on debts. Charging 25% interest per annum may violate usury laws, depending on the state where the contract is enforced. Additionally, shortening the grace period for payments to 10 days may be considered unreasonably short under certain circumstances, potentially conflicting with fairness and good faith principles in contract law.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the amount of time of written notification at least five (5) days is an insufficient amount of time, and depending on which state this is being contracted, could be a breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "In the event that either Wade or Naked wishes to extend the Term of the Agreement as contemplated above, it shall provide the other Party with written notice at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term. The other Party will then have a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of the notice to indicate whether it also desires to extend the Term, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and if no such indication is made, the other Party will be deemed to have declined the offer to extend.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that either Wade or Naked wishes to extend the Term of the Agreement as contemplated above, it shall provide the other Party with written notice at least ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the Term. The other Party will then have a period of one (1) day from the date of the notice to indicate whether it also desires to extend the Term, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and if no such indication is made, the other Party will be deemed to have declined the offer to extend.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notice period for extending the agreement from 90 days to 10 days and the response period from 14 days to 1 day. While there isn't a specific law mandating a 90-day notice for contract extension options, drastically shortening the period could be deemed unconscionable, particularly if one party is at a disadvantage. New York law emphasizes fair dealing and good faith in contracts; such a short timeframe could be viewed as a violation of these principles, especially if it prejudices one party's ability to properly assess the extension.",

                "changed_text": "Naked shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately without any prior written notice to Wade in the event Wade fails to perform the Wade Services or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the essence of this Agreement).",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the notice and cure period for breaches by Wade, allowing Naked to terminate the agreement immediately. In New York, while contracts can stipulate termination conditions, courts often require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, especially if the breach is not material. Eliminating the notice and cure period entirely could be deemed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, making the termination clause potentially unenforceable. It gives Naked excessive power and deprives Wade of the opportunity to rectify the issue.",

                "explanation": "This change expands the indemnity provision, requiring Wade to indemnify Naked even for claims arising from Naked's own gross negligence. Under New York law, it is against public policy to indemnify a party for their own gross negligence or intentional misconduct. While parties can agree to indemnification, such clauses are generally unenforceable if they attempt to shield a party from liability for their own egregious acts. This change would likely render the indemnity provision at least partially unenforceable.",

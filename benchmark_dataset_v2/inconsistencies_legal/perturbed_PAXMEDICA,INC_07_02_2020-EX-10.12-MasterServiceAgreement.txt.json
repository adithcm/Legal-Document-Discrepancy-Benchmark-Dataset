                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "2.4 CRO will provide a detailed account of all time and tasks, as against project specific task and time addenda, and will be payable within 30 days of receipt of invoice by Client.",
                "changed_text": "2.4 CRO will provide a detailed account of all time and tasks, as against project specific task and time addenda, and will be payable within 60 days of receipt of invoice by Client.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadline to 60 days. While not inherently illegal, exceeding standard payment terms (often 30 days) without justification could be considered an unfair business practice or violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions (though this depends on the specific industry and location). Many small businesses need cashflow and extending this out, especially if left vague, could create legal issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of prompt payment laws or unfair business practice regulations depending on jurisdiction and industry standards.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",
                "changed_text": "4.1. Either party may terminate this Agreement on ten (10) days written notice if the other materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however that the party in breach shall have the right to cure such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of the other party's intention to terminate.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice and cure period to 10 days may be unreasonably short under certain state laws, particularly where complex services or significant investments are involved. This could be deemed insufficient time for the breaching party to rectify the issue, potentially leading to wrongful termination claims.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state contract laws requiring reasonable notice and cure periods for material breaches, depending on the specific context and jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "By reducing the statute of limitations to one year, the contract now conflicts with the standard statute of limitations for contract claims in Connecticut (where the agreement is governed), which is typically several years (often six years). This shorter period could prevent parties from pursuing legitimate claims if they discover the breach after the one-year window.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for insurance policy changes to just one day introduces a significant risk of non-compliance with standard aviation insurance practices and legal requirements. Insurance providers typically require a more extended notice period (often 30 days or more) to allow for adequate risk assessment and policy adjustments. This modification could violate contractual obligations with insurance carriers and potentially breach aviation regulations related to adequate insurance coverage.",

                "changed_text": "3.4 Within [*****] as from the date of Delivery of any Item of the Stock, the Company shall be responsible for obtaining and shall provide the Repairer with evidence in respect of (i) custom clearance, including payment fees, customs duties, and (ii) customs declarations, with respect to the relevant Stock Item. If such evidence is not provided within 7 days, Repairer can charge a penalty fee.",
                "explanation": "Brazilian customs regulations require specific timelines for customs clearance and documentation. Setting a very short, fixed deadline and adding a penalty fee might not align with the actual legally permissible timeframes and procedures for customs compliance in Brazil, thus introducing a conflict.",

                "explanation": "Setting unrealistically short delivery times (1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes) is an inconsistency with realistic business practices. This could be viewed as an unenforceable obligation if the times are impossible to meet due to logistical constraints, conflicting with good faith principles in contract law.",

                "explanation": "For AZUL which operates in Brazil, setting a notification deadline of 24 hours for a major decision and 48 hours to return the stock could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially considering the scale of the operation, distance, and potential logistical challenges of returning the stock. This may be viewed as a violation of good faith contract performance.",

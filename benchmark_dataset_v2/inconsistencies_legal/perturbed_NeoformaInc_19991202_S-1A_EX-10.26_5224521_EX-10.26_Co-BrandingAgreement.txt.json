                "original_text": "VerticalNet shall provide notice to Neoforma of each advertiser that agrees to place an advertisement on a Neoforma Site on the terms and conditions contained in the then current Neoforma Advertising Policies. Neoforma shall then have three business days after receipt of such notice to (a) accept or reject such advertiser, in its reasonable business discretion, and (b) notify VerticalNet of its decision. If, at the end of such three-day period, Neoforma has not responded to such notice, Neoforma shall be deemed to have accepted such advertiser. Neoforma shall then work with the advertiser to facilitate the placement of the advertisement and maintain such advertisement on the agreed-upon page of a Neoforma Site. Neoforma shall have the right to terminate its agreement with any such advertiser in its reasonable business discretion. Neoforma shall be responsible for, and shall have sole control of, all credit, billing and collection with the advertisements on the Neoforma Sites. VerticalNet shall have no authority to make collections on behalf of Neoforma.",
                "changed_text": "VerticalNet shall provide notice to Neoforma of each advertiser that agrees to place an advertisement on a Neoforma Site on the terms and conditions contained in the then current Neoforma Advertising Policies. Neoforma shall then have one business day after receipt of such notice to (a) accept or reject such advertiser, in its reasonable business discretion, and (b) notify VerticalNet of its decision. If, at the end of such one-day period, Neoforma has not responded to such notice, Neoforma shall be deemed to have accepted such advertiser.

                "explanation": "The change reduces the time Neoforma has to respond to VerticalNet's notice of advertisers from three business days to one business day. This timeframe could be considered unreasonably short, particularly for a significant decision that may require careful evaluation, potentially conflicting with general principles of fair dealing and reasonableness implied in contract law.",

Any failure of the Receiving Party to respond within such five business day period shall be deemed disapproval of the advertising materials in question.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the response time from five business days to one to approve advertising materials is unreasonable. Reviewing advertising campaigns involves multiple departments and, by law, requires more than one day. This may also go against the 'Good Faith' clause later in the contract. ",

                "original_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in six (6) equal installments, each due on or prior to the 1st of each month between June and November of the applicable Contract Year.",
                "changed_text": "Sponsor shall pay Club the Annual Fee for each Contract Year of this Agreement in two (2) equal installments, the first due on December 31st and the second due at the company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts standard business practices and potentially Florida Statutes regarding payment terms. Requiring only two payments, one significantly delayed, and the other at the company's discretion, introduces uncertainty and could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; Potential violation of Florida Statutes related to contract law regarding reasonable payment terms.",

                "explanation": "This modification creates an inconsistency. The original text allows the club to have a time-bounded duration of twelve months, however, the new modification makes it null and void and that the trade value will immediately expire.",

                "explanation": "This modification contradicts standard payment procedures and could violate principles of fair dealing. The elimination of any grace period for payment and Club's failure to provide invoice relieve all obligation violates standard contract law principles, thus introducing legal risks.",

This creates a contradiction because, depending on the state, providing only 12 hours' notice might violate securities regulations requiring reasonable notice for significant transactions to protect shareholders and ensure market transparency. The change fails to meet standard notification periods and increases the risk of insufficient disclosure.",

                "explanation": "The change alters the timeline for delivering a 'ROFO Purchase Notice' and closing the purchase of shares. By extending the period to 3 days and also 10 business days after the notice, it conflicts with standard market practices requiring prompt action on such offers, also delaying the closing by extending the period, which could be considered unreasonable and thus unenforceable. Such delays can violate requirements for timely transactions under securities laws.",

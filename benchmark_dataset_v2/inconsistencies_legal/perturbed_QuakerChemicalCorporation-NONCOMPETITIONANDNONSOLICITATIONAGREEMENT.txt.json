                "explanation": "Increasing the non-compete period to five years and expanding the geographic scope to include India, while decreasing the passive investment allowance and increasing the acquired business net sales can render the non-compete agreement excessively broad and potentially unenforceable under Pennsylvania law, which requires non-competes to be reasonably limited in time, territory, and scope to protect a legitimate business interest.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-solicitation period to one year and increasing the waiting period for soliciting former employees to twelve months may be deemed unreasonable and insufficient to protect the Buyer's legitimate business interests, potentially conflicting with Pennsylvania law requiring reasonable restrictions to protect against unfair competition.",

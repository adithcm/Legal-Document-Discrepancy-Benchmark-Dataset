                "original_text": "Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco, payment terms shall be [*****] days from shipping date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].",
                "changed_text": "Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco, payment terms shall be 180 days from shipping date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms significantly beyond typical industry standards (e.g., net 30, net 60) can create issues under the UCC, especially if they are deemed unconscionable or place undue burden on the supplier (Cisco). While not a direct violation, such extended terms could be challenged as commercially unreasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - potential issues with commercial reasonableness and unconscionability.",

Any initial credit requests submitted by the Distributor to Cisco greater than [*****] after the underlying point of sale transaction will not be honored by Cisco and Cisco will not grant such credit to Distributor.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor must make the initial credit request to Cisco, in writing, within 10 days of the underlying point of sale transaction. Any initial credit requests submitted by the Distributor to Cisco greater than 10 days after the underlying point of sale transaction will not be honored by Cisco and Cisco will not grant such credit to Distributor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for credit requests to 10 days is problematic because it may conflict with standard accounting practices and dispute resolution timelines, particularly for complex transactions, violating principles of fair dealing. While not a specific statute, such a short timeframe could be deemed commercially unreasonable and unenforceable in some jurisdictions.",

                "explanation": "Limiting the warranty service period to 30 days, irrespective of the original product warranty provided by Cisco, could violate consumer protection laws and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in the United States, if the original warranty extends beyond 30 days. This Act prevents deceptive warranty practices and ensures consumers receive clear warranty information.",

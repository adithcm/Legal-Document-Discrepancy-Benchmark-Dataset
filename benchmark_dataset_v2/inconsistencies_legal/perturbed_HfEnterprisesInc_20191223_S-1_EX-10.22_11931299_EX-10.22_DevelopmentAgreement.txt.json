                "original_text": "The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"Term\".",
                "changed_text": "The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 5-days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. For purposes hereof, the Initial Term, together with any extension or renewal terms, shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"Term\".",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 5 days creates a potential conflict with standard contract law principles, especially in New York, which often require a more reasonable notice period, particularly in ongoing business relationships. A 5-day notice may be deemed unreasonably short and could be challenged in court, depending on the specific circumstances and the relationship between the parties.",

                "explanation": "Decreasing the confidentiality period to one year could be deemed unreasonably short depending on the nature of the confidential information being protected. Many trade secret and intellectual property protection agreements require longer periods (e.g., 3-5 years or even indefinite) to ensure adequate protection. This could violate standard business practices and legal expectations for protecting sensitive technology and business information, making it more susceptible to challenge.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the notice provisions to remove receipt confirmation for email and courier services, and using standard mail could violate standard contract law and expectations regarding valid notice. For critical legal notices, proof of receipt is generally required to establish that the notice was properly delivered and received. Removing these safeguards could lead to disputes over whether proper notice was given, making the notice provisions unenforceable.",

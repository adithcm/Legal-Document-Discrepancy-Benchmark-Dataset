                "original_text": "5.3 The Distributor must pay the full amount invoiced to it by the Supplier in USD$'s within thirty (45) days of the date of invoice.",
                "changed_text": "5.3 The Distributor must pay the full amount invoiced to it by the Supplier in USD$'s within fifteen (15) days of the date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the payment period from 45 days to 15 days. While not universally illegal, such a short payment window could be considered unreasonable and conflict with standard business practices and potentially the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in some jurisdictions, particularly if the distributor is a small business. This may contradict state-level prompt payment laws that afford more reasonable payment terms.",

                "changed_text": "10.2 The Distributor shall, within one day of a matter which may result in a Relevant Claim:\n\n(a) give the Supplier written notice of the details of the matter;\n\n(b) give the Supplier access to and allow copies to be taken of any materials, records or documents as the Supplier may require to take action under clause 10.2(c);\n\n(c) allow the Supplier the exclusive conduct of any proceedings and take any action that the Supplier requires to defend or resist the matter, including using professional advisers nominated by the Supplier; and\n\n(d) not admit liability or settle the matter without the Supplier's written consent.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the notification period for potential product liability claims from five days to one day. This extremely short timeframe could be deemed unreasonable and may violate state laws requiring a reasonable opportunity to investigate claims. Such a short window may be considered procedurally unconscionable, particularly if the distributor needs more time to assess the situation before notifying the supplier.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the required notice period for termination from twelve months to one month. This may conflict with state franchise laws, which often mandate longer notice periods for termination to protect distributors, giving them adequate time to wind down operations and find alternative arrangements.",

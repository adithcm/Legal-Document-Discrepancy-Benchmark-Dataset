                "changed_text": "CLIENT acknowledges that irreparable injury and damage may result from the disclosure to any third party of Proprietary Information associated with the Product and agrees (1) not to disclose any Proprietary Information to any third party unless compelled by law, and (2) to allow any third party to possess, handle, disassemble, touch, photograph, film or otherwise record images of the Product while the Product is upon CLIENT'S premises or in CLIENT'S possession, custody or control, regardless of whether the product has been purchased with a purchase order and payment fulfilled.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens the confidentiality clause. By adding 'unless compelled by law,' it creates ambiguity regarding what constitutes a legal compulsion, potentially undermining trade secret protection. Furthermore, allowing third-party access to the product regardless of purchase agreement directly conflicts with reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, potentially jeopardizing Bosch's intellectual property under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and Nevada trade secret laws.",

                "explanation": "This change expands the indemnity clause to include claims arising from Bosch's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                "explanation": "This modification attempts to shield BOSCH's product generation and delivery processes from any audit, even in cases of legal dispute. This conflicts with legal principles of discovery and evidence, where courts can compel the disclosure of relevant information, even if confidential, in legal proceedings. It could be deemed an attempt to obstruct justice or prevent fair resolution of disputes, especially if product safety is at issue. This conflicts with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.",

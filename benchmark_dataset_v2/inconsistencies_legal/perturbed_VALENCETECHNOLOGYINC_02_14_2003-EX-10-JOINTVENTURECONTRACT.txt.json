                "original_text": "in the event that either party fails to make its capital contribution, in whole or in part, within [90] days of the due date, or in the event that any of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 34 of this Contract have not been satisfied or waived within [120] days of the date on which this Contract is signed by the parties;",
                "changed_text": "in the event that either party fails to make its capital contribution, in whole or in part, within [30] days of the due date, or in the event that any of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 34 of this Contract have not been satisfied or waived within [45] days of the date on which this Contract is signed by the parties;",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for capital contribution failure and unmet conditions precedent to 30 and 45 days respectively could be considered unreasonable and may be challenged in courts. China's Contract Law requires reasonable periods for fulfilling contractual obligations.",

                "changed_text": "the other Party materially breaches this Contract or materially violates the Articles of Association, and such breach or violation is not cured within fifteen (15) days of written notice to the breaching/violating Party;",
                "explanation": "Decreasing the cure period for a material breach to 15 days is unreasonably short. Depending on the nature of the breach, this might not provide sufficient time for remediation, conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith under Chinese contract law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the application period for contract extension to one month prior to expiration may violate procedural requirements. The Examination and Approval Authority in China needs reasonable time for review and approval, and the shortened period is unlikely to comply with regulations, potentially jeopardizing the extension.",

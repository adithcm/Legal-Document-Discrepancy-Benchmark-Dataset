                "original_text": "(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party: (i) becomes insolvent; (ii) files a petition in bankruptcy; or (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "changed_text": "(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party: (i) becomes insolvent; (ii) files a petition in bankruptcy; or (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows a 30-day cure period for a material breach. Reducing this cure period to 10 days contradicts standard contract law principles, which often consider a 30-day cure period reasonable. Some jurisdictions might view a 10-day cure period as insufficient, especially for complex breaches, making this clause potentially unenforceable or leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from two years to one year weakens the protection of Confidential Information, potentially conflicting with industry standards and best practices for protecting proprietary data.

                "explanation": "The modification to the payment schedule imposes a very high upfront deposit (90%), which may be deemed unconscionable or violate consumer protection laws depending on the jurisdiction. Such a large deposit shifts an unreasonable amount of risk to the client before any significant work is performed. Reducing payments for the four milestones exacerbates this risk imbalance, increasing the likelihood that the client is unfairly disadvantaged and setting the stage for potential legal challenges based on fairness and good faith dealing.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance timeframe to 2 seconds is unreasonably short, creating potential liability issues related to driver safety and fair labor practices. Drivers may feel pressured to accept orders without proper evaluation, potentially leading to accidents or violations of traffic laws. This could expose Pelican Delivers to legal claims related to negligence or vicarious liability.",

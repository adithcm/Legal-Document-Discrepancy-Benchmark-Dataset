On or before the tenth day of each calendar month, PrimeCall shall prepare for DeltaThree a report detailing the total revenues and expenses associated with the sale and use of the Calling Cards in the previous month. In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree shall provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within seven (7) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputes.",

In the event that DeltaThree disputes any amounts set forth on the report, DeltaThree must provide PrimeCall with written notice of such dispute, which notice shall detail the reasons for the dispute, within two (2) days of its receipt thereof. The parties shall negotiate at their leisure to resolve any such disputes.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that PrimeCall has to deliver the report within 10 days of each calendar month. The modified contract changes this to when 'practically feasible', and shortens the dispute time to 2 days. This contradicts standard business practices that require transparency and reasonable time frames for reporting, and many jurisdictions require at least 10 days to dispute financial records.",

The parties have no obligation to negotiate any disputes.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states that DeltaThree has to deliver the report within 10 days of each calendar month, and the other party has 7 days to dispute, with a good faith negotiation. The modification gives DeltaThree the option to deliver whenever it wants, and only gives one day to dispute, with no negotiation required, which violates fair and reasonable business practices.",

In the event that either PrimeCall or DeltaThree materially breaches any of its duties or obligations hereunder, which breach shall not be cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the breaching party specifying the breach, then either PrimeCall or DeltaThree, as the case may be, may, by giving written notice thereof to the other, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination, which date shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date of such notice.",

The breaching party has no right to contest any termination.",
                "explanation": "This section originally allows a 30-day cure period for a breach of contract, with a 10-day notice for termination. The modification reduces the cure period to 5 days, allows immediate termination, and revokes the right to contest the termination. This is particularly egregious since NY law assumes a 'reasonable' cure period, and most complex business contracts are given 30-60 days.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) days after the date that it receives written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows a 30-day cure period for a material breach. Reducing this to 10 days creates a conflict with standard contract law principles that typically provide a reasonable period (often 30 days) to cure breaches, especially in complex commercial agreements. This shorter period could be deemed unreasonable and thus unenforceable under New York law.",

                "changed_text": "Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be within 24 hours of when such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it stipulates that the termination is effective within 24 hours of receipt. This is problematic because it might not align with the specific notice periods required by Florida law (where the company is located), which might require a longer notice period depending on the circumstances and the nature of the agreement. By mandating a 24-hour turnaround, the contract potentially violates legal requirements for reasonable notice.",

This Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law doctrine. The Parties agree that the venue for the resolution of all disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein will be the County of Pinellas, State of Florida.",

This Agreement and the legal relations among the Parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law doctrine.

                "explanation": "The original text provides a 60-day period for mediation before resorting to arbitration. This change reduces that period to 15 days. By shortening the mediation period to 15 days, the contract could be deemed as not providing a reasonable opportunity to resolve disputes through mediation, potentially conflicting with Florida's preference for alternative dispute resolution and good faith negotiation.",

                "explanation": "By stating that 'The Company will not report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant,' the contract directly contradicts IRS regulations that require companies to report payments made to independent contractors exceeding a certain threshold (typically $600) using Form 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC. This is a clear violation of federal tax law.",

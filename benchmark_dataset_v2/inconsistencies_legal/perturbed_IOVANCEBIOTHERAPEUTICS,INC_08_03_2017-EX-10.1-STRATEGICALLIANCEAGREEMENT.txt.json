                "original_text": "Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall notify LBIO within twenty-four (24) hours after learning of any serious AE and any special situation report (both as defined in the applicable Protocol) incurred during or as the result of the Study, and provide a written confirmation report of such individual serious adverse event and special situation report promptly thereafter, as well as a monthly listing of all such serious adverse events and special situation reports, by electronic mail to: lionbiosafety@lionbio.com.",
                "changed_text": "Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall notify LBIO within seventy-two (72) hours after learning of any serious AE and any special situation report (both as defined in the applicable Protocol) incurred during or as the result of the Study, and provide a written confirmation report of such individual serious adverse event and special situation report ten (10) days thereafter, as well as a quarterly listing of all such serious adverse events and special situation reports, by electronic mail to: lionbiosafety@lionbio.com.",
                "explanation": "The change in reporting timeframe for serious adverse events introduces a contradiction. FDA guidelines and many institutional policies require expedited reporting of serious adverse events, often within 24 hours. Delaying the initial notification to 72 hours and the written confirmation to 10 days, and the listing to quarterly, violates these standards, potentially compromising patient safety and regulatory compliance.",

Following receipt of such proposed Publication, LBIO shall have the right to cause MD Anderson to (i) withhold publication or other public disclosure thereof for a period of up to 90 days in order to provide LBIO time to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection thereof, and (ii) remove any proprietary, or otherwise confidential, information of LBIO contained in such Publication (excluding Research results).",

Following receipt of such proposed Publication, LBIO shall have the right to cause MD Anderson to (i) withhold publication or other public disclosure thereof for a period of up to 180 days in order to provide LBIO time to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection thereof, and (ii) remove any proprietary, or otherwise confidential, information of LBIO contained in such Publication (excluding Research results).",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the timeline for publication review, which can conflict with academic norms and open access mandates. Reducing the pre-disclosure review period to 15 days might be insufficient for thorough intellectual property assessment, while extending the potential withholding period to 180 days could hinder academic freedom and potentially violate university policies regarding timely dissemination of research findings. Universities frequently require reasonable review periods and might view 180 days as excessive, leading to legal challenges regarding academic freedom.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days may be deemed unreasonable in certain jurisdictions. Depending on the nature and complexity of the breach, 10 days might not provide sufficient time for the breaching party to rectify the situation, potentially leading to claims of wrongful termination. Contract law generally requires cure periods to be commercially reasonable, considering the specific circumstances.",

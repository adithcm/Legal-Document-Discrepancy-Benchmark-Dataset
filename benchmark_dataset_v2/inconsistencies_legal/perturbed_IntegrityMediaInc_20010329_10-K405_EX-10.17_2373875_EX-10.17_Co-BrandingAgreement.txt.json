At its sole expense, TL will create all artwork for Product covers and packaging, and furnish Integrity with the same for manufacturing of the Products.

Such auditing party must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period. Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason whatsoever.

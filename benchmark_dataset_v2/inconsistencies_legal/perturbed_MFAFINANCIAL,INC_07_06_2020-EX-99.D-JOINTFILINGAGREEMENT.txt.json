                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the parties may choose individually whether to participate in joint filings of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any amendments. Each party is solely responsible for their filings, regardless of the agreement.",
                "explanation": "This modification attempts to negate the requirement for a formal joint filing agreement, suggesting that parties can individually decide whether or not to jointly file, which contradicts SEC regulations that mandate a formal agreement when parties act as a group.",

                "explanation": "This contradicts the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN Act) and most state laws (like the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act - UETA) which give legal validity to electronic signatures and allow agreements to be formed via counterparts.",

                "explanation": "By setting the effective date to be *before* the actual execution date, the contract introduces an inconsistency that makes the agreement immediately invalid. Contract law requires agreements to reflect the actual dates of agreement and execution.",

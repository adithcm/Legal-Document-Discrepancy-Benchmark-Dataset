                "original_text": "Distributor will pay WGT the full amount invoiced within thirty (30) days after the date of WGT's invoice, unless provided otherwise on the applicable invoice, in the lawful money of the United States of America to WGT by wire transfer of immediately available funds to WGT's bank account number 1141139, at the Commerce Bank of Washington, 601 Union Street, Suite 3600, Seattle, WA 98101, ABA routing number 125008013.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor will pay WGT the full amount invoiced within sixty (60) days after the date of WGT's invoice, unless provided otherwise on the applicable invoice, in the lawful money of the United States of America to WGT by wire transfer of immediately available funds to WGT's bank account number 1141139, at the Commerce Bank of Washington, 601 Union Street, Suite 3600, Seattle, WA 98101, ABA routing number 125008013.",
                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 60 days when a shorter timeframe is standard business practice could be considered an unfair or deceptive practice, depending on the specific circumstances and industry standards, potentially leading to legal challenges under state laws. Many jurisdictions have prompt payment laws that could be contradicted by the extended payment period.",

Any such audit will be conducted at such times and in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Distributor's normal operations. If any such audit discloses that Distributor is deficient in its compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Distributor will immediately pay to WGT any deficiency, plus interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month running from the date originally due until the date paid.",
                "changed_text": "Upon WGT's request, Distributor will provide access to such records for examination, reproduction, and audit by WGT or its representatives. Any such audit will be conducted at WGT's discretion, with minimal notice to Distributor. If any such audit discloses that Distributor is deficient in its compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Distributor will immediately pay to WGT any deficiency, plus interest at the rate of two and one-half percent (2.5%) per month running from the date originally due until the date paid.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the interest rate to 2.5% per month (30% annually) may exceed usury limits in some states, thus contradicting state laws regarding maximum permissible interest rates. Also, providing \"minimal notice\" for audits can be viewed as breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it could unreasonably disrupt the distributor's business.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame to report defects to 10 days may be considered unreasonably short, especially for complex products or when dealing with end-users who may not immediately discover defects. This can contradict consumer protection laws that imply a reasonable timeframe for reporting defects and seeking remedies.",

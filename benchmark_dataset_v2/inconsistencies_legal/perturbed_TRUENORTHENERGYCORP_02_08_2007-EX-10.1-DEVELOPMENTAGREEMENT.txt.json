                "original_text": "Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.",
                "changed_text": "Company shall have twelve (12) hours from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall Complete the Initial Well even if Company has not notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate before twelve (12) hours have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a 48-hour response window for the company to decide on participation in the completion of the well. Reducing this to 12 hours creates a legal contradiction because it provides an unreasonably short timeframe that may not allow the company adequate time to evaluate the well information and make an informed decision, violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts. Also, the change that BP 'shall Complete the Initial Well even if Company has not notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate before twelve (12) hours have elapsed' opens the possibility for BP to act without the knowledge of the company's interest.",

                "changed_text": "Company shall have ten (10) days from receipt of such written notice to elect whether it shall participate in such Substitute Well. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Substitute Well.",
                "explanation": "The original text gives the company 30 days to decide on participating in a substitute well. Decreasing the time frame to 10 days could be deemed unreasonable under Louisiana law, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if the decision requires complex analysis.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party may change its address by notifying the other Party in writing of such address change, and the change will be effective five (5) days after such notification is received by the other Party.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states that an address change becomes effective 30 days after notification. Reducing this period to 5 days is unreasonable because it may not allow sufficient time for the counterparty to update its records and ensure proper delivery of notices, especially given the complexities of business operations. This could potentially lead to missed deadlines or other legal issues arising from misdirected communications, contradicting the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Company shall provide and maintain, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance and advertising injury coverage, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), and shall cause such policy to be endorsed to state that Duval is an additional named insured thereunder. A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within thirty (30) days of the full execution of this Agreement. Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.",

A certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage shall be furnished to Duval within sixty (60) days of the full execution of this Agreement. Such insurance policy shall provide that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such policy or remove Duval as an additional named insured without prior written notice to Duval at least ten (10) days in advance thereof.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a certificate of insurance to be furnished within 30 days and a 20-day notice for policy changes. The modified text extends the certificate deadline to 60 days and reduces the advance notice for policy changes to 10 days. This creates a conflict as standard business practice and potentially insurance regulations expect reasonable and prompt notification timelines, making the 10 days unreasonable.",

                "changed_text": "If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or&bbsp;perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the nondefaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: as to (i) if such payment is not made within three (3) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment, or as to (ii) if such default is not cured within fifteen (15) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows 10 days to cure a payment default and 30 days to cure other defaults. The modified text reduces these cure periods to 3 and 15 days, respectively. This change introduces a potential conflict with standard commercial reasonableness, as 3 days may be insufficient to rectify a payment issue, and 15 days might not provide enough time to address more complex breaches of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates submission of insurance policy evidence within 30 days and a 20-day advance notice for termination or modification. The modification extends the submission timeframe to 60 days while shrinking the termination notice to 10 days. This conflicts with prudence in insurance management, where timely policy validation and sufficient notice enable mitigation of risks, possibly violating related regulations.",

                "original_text": "Such reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo in advance or immediately upon such costs being incurred, or otherwise in accordance with historical practice, unless otherwise agreed between the Operating Company and EmployeeCo.",
                "changed_text": "Such reimbursements shall be made by the Operating Company to EmployeeCo at the Operating Company's discretion, with no defined timeline or obligation for advanced or immediate payment.",
                "explanation": "Colorado law requires employers to have consistent payment schedules and prohibits arbitrary delays in wage payments. By removing the obligation for timely reimbursement and introducing complete discretion, this change contradicts state wage and hour laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Colorado Wage Claim Act, C.R.S. ยง 8-4-101 et seq.",
                "location": "Section 1.2"

                "explanation": "Under general contract law principles and potentially specific regulations depending on the industry, unreasonably short notice periods for termination can be deemed unconscionable. Five days may be considered too short to allow the other party reasonable time to mitigate damages. A one-day notice period exacerbates this issue.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law Principles regarding reasonable notice; potential industry-specific regulations",

                "changed_text": "Either party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any entity, without the need for prior consent from the other party. This assignment is effective immediately upon written notification to the other party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for consent for assignment, the contract potentially violates the principle of good faith and fair dealing. Colorado law generally implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, which means that parties must act honestly and reasonably. Unilateral assignment without consent could prejudice the other party's rights, especially if the assignee is less creditworthy or capable. Also, it would nullify the \"collateral assignment\" part, which exists as the ONLY exception.",

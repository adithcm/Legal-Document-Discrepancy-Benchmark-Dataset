                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 30 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 60 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the appointment of a Technical Committee within 30 days. Changing it to 60 days introduces a delay that may conflict with regulations requiring faster action in research and development, particularly in the context of clinical trials, as project timelines are critically time-sensitive, especially in the quickly-developing field of pharmaceutical research.",

To this purpose, before each publication, Molipharma will send in advance the text of the publication to Kiromic for approval. The consent of Kiromic will be tacitly granted after 30 days from receipt of the request for authorization of disclosure.",
                "changed_text": "Kiromic assigns to Molipharma all the rights of publication of the research, unless they are considered confidential for patenting. To this purpose, before each publication, Molipharma will send in advance the text of the publication to Kiromic for approval. The consent of Kiromic will be tacitly granted after 10 days from receipt of the request for authorization of disclosure.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows Kiromic 30 days to approve publications. Reducing this to 10 days could be problematic as it may not provide sufficient time for Kiromic to adequately assess and respond to publication requests. Some regulations or internal policies might require more time for review to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance before public disclosure, especially in sensitive areas like pharmaceuticals.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a 30-day notice for withdrawal from the JV. Reducing this to 10 days introduces a conflict. Many jurisdictions might consider a 10-day notice period inadequate for a complex joint venture, especially considering the potential financial and operational ramifications of a sudden withdrawal. This could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing or specific laws related to partnership dissolutions, which typically require more reasonable notice periods.",

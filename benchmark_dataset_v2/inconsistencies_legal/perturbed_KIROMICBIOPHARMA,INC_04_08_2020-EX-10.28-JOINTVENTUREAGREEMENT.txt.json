                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 30 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "changed_text": "The Steering Committee shall appoint, within 60 days of the signature of this JV, a Technical Committee composed of one representative of each of the Parties in relation to each specific -3- clinical trial program, which shall have the function of coordinating the technical and administrative activities to be undertaken in the framework of this JV.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the deadline for appointing the Technical Committee, which delays the establishment of technical coordination. If the laws in the United States consider thirty (30) days to be a reasonable time for setting up a committee of this nature to comply with R&D guidelines, an additional thirty (30) days could result in non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "This change modifies the timeline for IP disclosure. U.S. patent law prioritizes early disclosure. Delaying notification to 60 days could cause the loss of patent rights if another party independently develops the same invention and files a patent application sooner. Furthermore, this directly contradicts the standard of 'promptly notifying' which suggests an immediate action rather than a delayed one.",

                "explanation": "The contract states a minimum of 30 days’ notice is required for withdrawal. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific nature of the joint venture, statutes or case law may dictate a longer notice period to allow for a reasonable transition or to protect invested resources. Reducing this to 15 days potentially violates these requirements.",

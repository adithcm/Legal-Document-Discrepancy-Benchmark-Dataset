                "original_text": "With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance.",
                "changed_text": "With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced at any time at Operator's discretion, and shall be payable within ten (10) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the monthly rate of two percent (2%).",
                "explanation": "The original text requires invoices to be sent 30 days prior to the end of the month and provides 30 days for payment. It also caps interest rates at the legal maximum. The modified text reduces the payment window to 10 days, which may violate some state prompt payment laws, and removes the reference to the 'highest rate permissible by law', specifying an interest rate of 2% which may exceed usury laws depending on the state. This creates non-compliance by imposing an unreasonably short payment timeframe and potentially exceeding legal interest rate limits.",

If such Power Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5.",
                "changed_text": "Operator shall determine (i) for each full calendar month (the \"One- Month Power Performance Warranty Period\") within thirty (60) Business Days after the end of such month and (ii) for the most recent Look Back Period (the \"One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period\", and, together with the One-Month Power Performance Warranty Period, each a \"Power Performance Warranty Period\"), whether the Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during such Power Performance Warranty Period have delivered to the Interconnection Point the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period (the \"Power Performance Warranty\"). If such Power Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner orally of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'five (5) Business Days' to 'thirty (60) Business Days' delays the notification and claim process significantly. While not directly violating a specific law, unreasonably delaying claim processing could be construed as a breach of good faith and fair dealing, especially if it impacts Owner's ability to meet regulatory reporting deadlines or financial obligations. Additionally, the change from writing to orally may contradict Legal Requirements about documentation.",

                "explanation": "By negating the obligations under the Letter Agreement, this change directly conflicts with regulatory mandates and contractual obligations necessary to maintain QFCP status and receive tariff benefits. Some regulatory requirements require the Bloom System should retain service under the Tariffs, for example, and this removes that warranty. The removal of the conditions under which Operator must act to maintain qualification for QFCP status makes the contract non-compliant.",

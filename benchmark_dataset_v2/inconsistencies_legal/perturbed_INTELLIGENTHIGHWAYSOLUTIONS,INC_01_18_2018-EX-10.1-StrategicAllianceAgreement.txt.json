                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with Fazync via email to IHSI's CEO, Devon Jones, and delivered through Bravatek or a Fazync -designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by Fazync at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at Fazync bank account.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment NET 30 days, which is a common and generally acceptable business practice. Changing this to NET 90 days introduces a potential inconsistency, as excessively long payment terms can be deemed unreasonable or conflict with prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions, particularly if Bravatek is a small business. Texas prompt payment laws generally provide shorter deadlines for payment.",

Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",

Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a 90-day notice for non-renewal. Reducing this to 30 days may conflict with reasonable notice requirements implied under contract law in Texas, especially considering the strategic alliance nature of the agreement. A shorter notice period may be deemed insufficient to allow the other party to adequately prepare for the termination of the agreement and could be considered a breach of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality term is five years. Reducing this to one year may be insufficient to protect trade secrets or other sensitive information, potentially conflicting with the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA) if the information qualifies as a trade secret. A one-year term may be deemed unreasonable to protect proprietary information, particularly given the type of collaboration outlined in the contract.",

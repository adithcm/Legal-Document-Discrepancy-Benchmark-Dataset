                "original_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 25th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the immediate interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes the due date for monthly fees to the 25th of each month and stipulates immediate service interruption for late payments. Florida Statutes, particularly consumer protection laws, require businesses to provide reasonable notice before interrupting services due to late payments, often exceeding a 5-day grace period. This immediate interruption clause, therefore, contradicts standard business practices and consumer protection principles.",

                "original_text": "This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement, which notice must be given not less than five (5) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.",
                "explanation": "The clause originally requires 15 days' notice for non-renewal. Reducing this to 5 days may conflict with general contract law principles that require reasonable notice for termination or non-renewal, especially in service agreements. Depending on the specific industry and jurisdiction (Florida), a 5-day notice might be deemed unreasonably short, potentially leading to legal challenges based on insufficient time to make alternative arrangements.",

                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on, including payments for services not yet rendered.",
                "explanation": "The original clause obligates the customer to pay all 'amounts due'. The modified text now requires payment 'for services not yet rendered' even after termination. This contradicts the principle of 'unjust enrichment' in contract law, which prevents a party from receiving payment for services they have not provided. This clause could be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, particularly if the termination occurs due to i-on's breach of contract.",

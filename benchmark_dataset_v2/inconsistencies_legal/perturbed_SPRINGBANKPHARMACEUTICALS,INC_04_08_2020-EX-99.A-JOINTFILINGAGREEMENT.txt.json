                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and further agree that this agreement be included as an exhibit to such filing. Each party to the agreement expressly authorizes each other party to file on its behalf any and all amendments to such statement.",
                "changed_text": "The parties agree to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) with respect to the Common Stock of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc., but this agreement does not need to be included as an exhibit to such filing. Each party to the agreement authorizes each other party to file on its behalf amendments to such statement, provided written consent is received 5 days prior to the filing date.",
                "explanation": "Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates that the joint filing agreement be included as an exhibit to the filing. This change eliminates that requirement and adds a restriction that contradicts the flexibility allowed for amendments. The new 5 day written consent will add burden to the parties.",

                "explanation": "This change mandates a single original document, conflicting with the generally accepted practice of signing agreements in counterparts, which is legally permissible and often more practical. Also, changes the day in April to December in the future, even though it was created in April 2020.",

                "explanation": "Imposing a stringent 1-day review period for amendments on Schedule 13G filings could be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the potential complexity and significance of these filings, thus leading to legal contestations.",

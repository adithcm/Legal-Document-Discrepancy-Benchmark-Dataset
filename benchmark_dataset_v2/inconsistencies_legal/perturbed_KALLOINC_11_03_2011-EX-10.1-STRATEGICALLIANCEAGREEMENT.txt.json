                "original_text": "Agent accepts and acknowledges that the Kallo 3 day Sales and 5 day Technical Training  Program is required to be completed by the Agent within 90 days of execution of this agreement. Agent is required  to pay a Training program fee of $10,000.00 for the Kallo Mobile care suite of Products on or before the date of  execution of this agreement for the Authorization of Agent under this agreement by Kallo. Agent shall pay $1000/- per day for any additional days of training requested by Agent and all travel expenses plus per diem for the Kallo  representative instructing the program will be due and payable to Kallo on or before execution of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Agent accepts and acknowledges that the Kallo 3 day Sales and 5 day Technical Training  Program is required to be completed by the Agent within 15 days of execution of this agreement. Agent is required  to pay a Training program fee of $10,000.00 for the Kallo Mobile care suite of Products on or before the date of  execution of this agreement for the Authorization of Agent under this agreement by Kallo. Agent shall pay $1000/- per day for any additional days of training requested by Agent and all travel expenses plus per diem for the Kallo  representative instructing the program will be due and payable to Kallo on or before execution of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires completion of the training program within 90 days, whereas the modified version reduces this period to 15 days. This creates an inconsistency because such a short timeframe may be deemed unreasonable or insufficient for adequate training, potentially violating fair business practice laws or regulations regarding adequate preparation of sales agents. This is more likely if the training is comprehensive and requires significant time commitment. Furthermore, the original text does not impose any penalty for non-compliance other than voiding the agreement, whereas the modified version's shorter deadline could lead to disputes and potential legal challenges regarding breach of contract and unfair imposition of impossible conditions.",

                "changed_text": "All sales made by the Agent of the Kallo Mobile care suite of products shall create a Book of Business owned by  the Agent, which constitutes all funds due to Agent under this agreement flowing from each sale for a period not to  exceed 12 months from the date of acceptance by Kallo of the Client EULA or until the EULA terminates under the  provision that are outlined therein of the Kallo Mobile care suite of products.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 36-month period for the Agent's 'Book of Business,' whereas the modified version reduces this to 12 months. This creates a legal contradiction because reducing the period for accruing benefits from sales commissions could be seen as an unfair or unreasonable reduction in compensation, potentially violating labor or contract laws related to earned commissions and vested rights. If the sales cycle and revenue generation typically extend beyond 12 months, this change could significantly deprive the Agent of rightfully earned income, leading to legal challenges based on breach of contract or unjust enrichment.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides the agent with 3 months to confirm the first purchase order with a down payment. The changed text reduces this to 1 month. This creates a contradiction because shortening the timeframe for the initial purchase order with the down payment places an unrealistic expectation on the Agent. Depending on the product, regulatory requirements and other processes, this action puts the Agent at risk of not meeting the commitment. Therefore this becomes an action of Bad Faith.",

While non-solicitation agreements are generally enforceable, a 24-month restriction, especially in a broad industry, may be deemed unreasonably long and thus an unenforceable restraint of trade under Virginia law, depending on the specific facts and circumstances. Virginia courts consider the function, geographic scope, and duration of the restriction.",

As used in this Section 7.2, \"Customer\" means any person or entity to which the Company provided products or services, including any tenants of the Company's properties, (or was invested in real estate owned by the Company), and with which CONSULTANT had contact on behalf of the Company, within the last twelve (12) months of its consultancy with the Company.",

                "explanation": "The original non-solicitation of customers clause has a restriction of 12 months and defines 'Customer' based on contact within the last 12 months of consultancy. The modified version extends both these periods to 24 and 36 months, respectively. This expansion makes the restriction potentially unreasonable and unenforceable under Virginia law as an overbroad restraint of trade, especially if the customer base is large and the consultant's role was limited. The reasonableness depends on the specifics of the consultant's role, the nature of the customer relationships, and the scope of competitive harm to the company.",

                "explanation": "The non-compete clause originally restricts the consultant for 12 months and defines 'Competitor' based on businesses with a principal place in Virginia or states where the company owns real estate. The modified text expands the restriction period to 36 months and broadens the geographic scope of 'Competitor' to include any business in the United States. This significantly increases the scope of the non-compete, potentially making it an unreasonable and unenforceable restraint of trade under Virginia law. Virginia courts require non-competes to be narrowly tailored to protect the employer's legitimate business interests, and this expanded scope is likely overbroad, especially if the consultant's role was not highly specialized or if the company does business in only a limited number of states. The expansion is even more problematic because it now prevents the consultant from being involved in the real estate business in the United States for 3 years.",

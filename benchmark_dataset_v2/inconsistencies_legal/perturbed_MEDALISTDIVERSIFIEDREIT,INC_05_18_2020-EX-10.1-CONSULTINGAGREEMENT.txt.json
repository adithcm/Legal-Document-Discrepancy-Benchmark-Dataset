                "original_text": "7.1 Solicitation of Employees. CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees, contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is (or was within the six (6) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company) an employee, exclusive contractor, or exclusive independent contractor of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twenty-four (24) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not, for itself or any other person or entity: (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company's employees, contractors, independent contractors or any person who provides services to the Company to terminate or reduce their employment or other relationship with the Company; (b) hire any individual who is (or was within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding such hiring, unless such employee was terminated from such employment by Company) an employee, exclusive contractor, or exclusive independent contractor of the Company; or (c) attempt to do any of the foregoing.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the non-solicitation period to 24 months and the hiring restriction to 12 months, potentially making it unreasonably long and broad, depending on Virginia law regarding non-compete agreements. Virginia courts scrutinize non-compete agreements, and such an extension may be deemed unenforceable if it is not narrowly tailored to protect the company's legitimate business interests.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not: (a) have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any Competitor; or (b) engage in or perform services for any Competitor, if such services either (1) are the same as or similar to (individually or in the aggregate) the services CONSULTANT performed for the Company during its consultancy with the Company, or (2) are performed with respect to products or services of the Competitor that are competitive with the products or services provided by the Company with which CONSULTANT was involved during its consultancy with the Company or about which it received Proprietary Information during its consultancy with the Company. As used in this section, \"Competitor\" means: (i) any private or publicly traded real estate investment trust, fund or other investment vehicle or program whose principal place of business is in Virginia or any other state in which the Company owns real estate and whose business strategy is based on investing in, acquiring or developing flex/industrial, retail, multifamily and limited service hotel real estate, whether directly or indirectly through joint ventures, or (ii) any entity whose principal place of business is in Virginia or any other state in which the Company owns real estate and that advises (including any external advisor) such investment vehicles or programs. It is agreed that ownership of no more than 1% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation will not constitute a violation of Section 7.3.",

CONSULTANT agrees that during its consultancy for REIT and for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following the termination of its consultancy with the Company for any reason, whether with or without cause, it will not: (a) have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any Competitor; or (b) engage in or perform services for any Competitor. As used in this section, \"Competitor\" means: (i) any private or publicly traded real estate investment trust, fund or other investment vehicle or program whose principal place of business is in the United States and whose business strategy is based on investing in, acquiring or developing real estate, whether directly or indirectly through joint ventures, or (ii) any entity whose principal place of business is in the United States and that advises (including any external advisor) such investment vehicles or programs. It is agreed that ownership of no more than 0.5% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation will not constitute a violation of Section 7.3.",
                "explanation": "The changes broaden the scope of the non-compete agreement, making it potentially unenforceable under Virginia law. Extending the non-compete period to 18 months increases the likelihood that a court would find it unreasonably restrictive. Broadening the definition of \"Competitor\" to include any entity with a principal place of business in the United States, rather than just Virginia or states where the Company owns real estate, makes the restriction geographically overbroad. Also, decreasing the percentage of acceptable ownership of the Company decreases the percentage of ownership, which is unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "By shortening the survival period of the indemnity clause to one year and removing the exception for gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party, the clause becomes potentially problematic and may violate public policy, depending on the specific circumstances and Virginia law. Indemnifying a party for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct is often disfavored and may be deemed unenforceable.",

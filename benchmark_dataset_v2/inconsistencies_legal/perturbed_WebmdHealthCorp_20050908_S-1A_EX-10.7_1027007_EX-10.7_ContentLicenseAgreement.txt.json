                "changed_text": "(a) Payments. In consideration for provision of the Content and all rights granted hereunder, Emdeon hereby agreed to pay WebMD the amounts set forth on Exhibit B of this Agreement. All amounts payable shall be due fifteen (15) days after the receipt of WebMD's invoice.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to 15 days contradicts standard business practices and potentially state-level prompt payment laws which often allow for a longer payment period. Many states have prompt payment laws that specify timelines for payments, and mandating a 15-day turnaround can be problematic depending on the specific jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period for Confidential Information to 90 days after termination is likely to be considered unreasonably short, particularly for sensitive business data. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, as it allows for rapid exploitation of confidential information post-termination. Trade secrets are protected for as long as they remain trade secrets, regardless of contract termination.",

                "explanation": "Stating that notices are deemed given upon dispatch, regardless of delivery or receipt confirmation, can contradict legal requirements for proper notification, especially in cases involving legal disputes or contract termination. Courts generally require proof of receipt or a reasonable attempt to deliver the notice. This change removes the assurance of receipt, potentially violating due process or fair notice requirements.",

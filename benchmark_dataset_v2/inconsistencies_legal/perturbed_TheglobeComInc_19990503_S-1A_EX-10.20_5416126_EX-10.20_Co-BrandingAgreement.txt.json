                "original_text": "Overdue payments shall accrue interest, at the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the maximum allowable interest under applicable law, from due date until paid, and the owing party shall pay the owed party's costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees).",
                "changed_text": "Overdue payments shall accrue interest at a fixed rate of 25% per month from the due date until paid, and the owing party shall be responsible for covering the owed party's collection costs.",
                "explanation": "This modification sets a fixed interest rate of 25% per month on overdue payments, irrespective of state-specific usury laws that may impose lower maximum interest rates. This creates a conflict with state laws designed to protect borrowers from excessive interest charges. Additionally, the deletion of the phrase \"(including reasonable attorneys' fees)\" creates uncertainty.",

Once every 12 months, the party receiving payment or its designee may inspect such records to verify reports.  Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the inspected party's business activities.",
                "changed_text": "A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep records related to payment computation for only 6 months. The party receiving payment may inspect such records at any time without notice. Any such inspection can be conducted even if it interferes with the inspected party's business activities.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the record-keeping period from 3 years to 6 months, potentially conflicting with statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims, which are typically longer. The removal of restrictions on inspection frequency and the allowance of interference with business activities also introduce contradictions with standard commercial reasonableness principles.",

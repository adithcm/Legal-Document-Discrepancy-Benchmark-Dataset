                "original_text": "5. Termination. If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "changed_text": "5. Termination. If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately without prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 5 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period without prior written notice to Maimon.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for termination with five days' notice. This has been modified to allow the company to terminate the agreement with Maimon immediately and without any prior written notice under certain circumstances (such as disability), and without any prior written notice after the Minimum Period. Additionally, Maimon is now only required to provide 5 days prior written notice before resignation. These changes are contradictory to standard employment law, which requires a reasonable notice period for termination to allow the employee to find a new job, and gives the company very little time to prepare for Maimon's resignation.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of ten (10) years after expiration or termination for any reason of this Agreement, Maimon agrees not to: (a) compete with the business of the Company, whether individually or through any entity, or to use (or permit the use of) any Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of competing with the business of the Company; or (b) suggest to, induce or persuade any customer, client, vendor, supplier, employee, consultant or agent of the Company to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original non-compete clause extends for two years after the termination of the agreement. This has been increased to ten years. This is likely an unreasonably long period for a non-compete agreement, especially given the limited scope of Maimon's role as a contract CEO, and would be difficult to enforce under New York law. The original clause may have been enforceable, but the modified text goes beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect the company's legitimate business interests, potentially violating New York law on unreasonable restraints on trade.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a monthly fee of $1,000. This has been reduced to $100 per month. If Maimon is working full time, this might violate minimum wage laws if Maimon is an employee, since $100 a month will not come up to federal or state minimum wage if converted to a weekly or hourly rate. Note that Maimon is referred to as the 'Company's Chief Executive Officer' and is expected to 'perform all the duties that are ordinarily and customarily performed by a CEO'.",

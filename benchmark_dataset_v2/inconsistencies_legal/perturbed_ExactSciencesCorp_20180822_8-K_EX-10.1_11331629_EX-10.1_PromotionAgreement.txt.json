Exact shall provide to Pfizer a weekly report detailing, on an Eligible Prescriber-by-Eligible Prescriber basis, the Product Laboratory Services activity, including but not limited to, the number of orders received, number of shipments sent to patients, and number of results sent back to prescriber.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party will provide the other Party a written report every 60 days, detailing (i) the number of Details completed and (ii) changes to Sales Representatives' Incentive Compensation. Exact will report Product Laboratory Services activity monthly.",
                "explanation": "Changing the reporting frequency from within fifteen (15) business days to every 60 days introduces a delay. Many laws, including those related to healthcare compliance and financial reporting, require more frequent and timely reporting to ensure accurate monitoring and compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a clear deadline (thirty days after each calendar quarter) for delivering the report and remitting the Promotion Fee. By changing this to 'at the company's convenience' and 'whenever possible,' the modification introduces ambiguity and violates standard accounting principles that require specific payment timelines. This could also run afoul of regulations that mandate timely payments to contractors/partners.",

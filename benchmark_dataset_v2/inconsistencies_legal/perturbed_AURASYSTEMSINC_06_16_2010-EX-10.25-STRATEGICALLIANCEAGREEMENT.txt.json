                "original_text": "Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) fifteen (15) business days  following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii)  forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated.  Aura shall have no obligation to remit payment for any Product before fifteen (15) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall  Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura.",
                "changed_text": "Aura shall remit payment to Zanotti for the invoiced price of any given Product within the earlier of: (i) ninety (90) business days following Aura's receipt and acceptance of payment from its customer for such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated; or (ii) one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from the date of Aura's shipment to a customer of such AETRU System into which such Product is incorporated. Aura shall have no obligation to remit payment for any Product before ninety (90) days following sale to a third-party of such Product nor shall Aura have any obligation to remit payment for any Product not sold by Aura.",
                "explanation": "The original payment terms require Aura to remit payment within 15 business days of receiving payment or 45 days from shipment. The modified version drastically extends these payment deadlines to 90 business days and 180 calendar days respectively. This could be considered an unreasonably long delay, potentially violating prompt payment laws or general principles of fair business practice, particularly if such extended delays are not standard in the industry or justified by specific circumstances. California law requires payments be made according to the agreement or else it will be considered breach of contract.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Zanotti agrees that Aura shall be allowed the full benefit of any and all lower prices  and/or any more favorable terms and/or conditions (\"MFN\" Terms) contained in any other agreement entered into by Zanotti for the sale of any  product substantially similar to the Product in the same or lesser quantities described in this Agreement to third parties. Zanotti shall notify Aura  in writing of any such MFN Terms within fifteen (15) calendar days after agreeing thereto, and shall make the MFN Terms available to Aura as of  the effective date of such agreement and thereafter for the greater of (i) three (3) months or (ii) such time that the MFN Terms remain in effect.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, Zanotti agrees that Aura shall be allowed the full benefit of any and all lower prices and/or any more favorable terms and/or conditions (\"MFN\" Terms) contained in any other agreement entered into by Zanotti for the sale of any product substantially similar to the Product in the same or lesser quantities described in this Agreement to third parties. Zanotti shall notify Aura in writing of any such MFN Terms within one year after agreeing thereto, and shall make the MFN Terms available to Aura as of the effective date of such agreement and thereafter for the lesser of (i) one (1) months or (ii) such time that the MFN Terms remain in effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Zanotti to notify Aura of more favorable terms within 15 calendar days, making the MFN terms available for at least 3 months. The modified version delays the notification to one year and reduces the availability to one month or until the terms are in effect, whichever is lesser. This delay and reduced duration could be deemed commercially unreasonable, particularly if it significantly impairs Aura's ability to compete or benefit from the MFN clause. This weakens the protection Aura is provided under the original agreement.",

                "changed_text": "The obligations with respect to all other Confidential Information shall cease immediately following termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By eliminating the five-year confidentiality period post-termination, this change directly contradicts established legal precedents and best practices for protecting trade secrets and confidential business information. California law recognizes and protects trade secrets and confidential information, imposing obligations even after the termination of a business relationship. Removing this obligation entirely could lead to significant harm and is unlikely to be upheld in court, potentially violating California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act.",

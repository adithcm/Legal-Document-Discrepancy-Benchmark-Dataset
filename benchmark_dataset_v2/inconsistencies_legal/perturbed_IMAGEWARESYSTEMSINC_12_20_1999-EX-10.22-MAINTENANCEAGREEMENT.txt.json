                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "MORPHO shall pay all charges under this Agreement, including the total Annual Maintenance Charge, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a valid invoice from XIMAGE. Thereafter, the then applicable Annual Maintenance Charge shall be invoiced to, and paid by MORPHO prior to the beginning of the next annual maintenance period. All other charges under this Agreement shall be invoiced by XIMAGE and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice.",
                "changed_text": "MORPHO shall pay all charges under this Agreement, including the total Annual Maintenance Charge, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a valid invoice from XIMAGE. Thereafter, the then applicable Annual Maintenance Charge shall be invoiced to, and paid by MORPHO prior to the beginning of the next annual maintenance period. All other charges under this Agreement shall be invoiced by XIMAGE and shall be due and payable within ninety (90) days after receipt of the invoice.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment deadlines beyond a commercially reasonable timeframe, potentially conflicting with California prompt payment laws if MORPHO is considered a small business or if specific industries have shorter mandated payment terms. The original 30-day term might be standard; the modified terms could cause financial strain and violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing under California law.",

                "changed_text": "XIMAGE will endeavor to respond to telephone calls from MORPHO as resources permit.",
                "explanation": "This removes the definite obligation for a 30-minute response time, replacing it with a vague commitment based on resource availability. If the contract pertains to critical systems where timely support is essential (which the context suggests it might), this could violate implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, especially if MORPHO relied on the 30-minute response guarantee. This introduces ambiguity that could render the service level unenforceable and open to interpretation.",

                "explanation": "This reduces the statute of limitations for contract-related claims to six months. This conflicts with California's statute of limitations for breach of written contract, which is four years. Shortening this period can be deemed unconscionable, especially if one party has significantly less bargaining power.",

                "original_text": "C. MKOS will have 30-days from receipt of information to determine if they wish to go forward with the technology license. UTEK, after 30 days, shall have the right to present the technology to other clients.",
                "changed_text": "C. MKOS will have 10-days from receipt of information to determine if they wish to go forward with the technology license. UTEK, after 10 days, shall have the right to present the technology to other clients.",
                "explanation": "This modification reduces the decision period for MKOS to 10 days. Such a short timeframe could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially given the complexity of technology licensing decisions. This could contradict general contract law principles requiring reasonable timeframes for decision-making.",

In consideration for the services to be provided herein, MKOS agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate or cash payment within five (5) days of both parties executing this Agreement. If no consideration is received in the timeline, UTEK has the unilateral option to terminate this Agreement.",

In consideration for the services to be provided herein, MKOS agrees that it will remit the agreed upon stock certificate or cash payment within one (1) day of both parties executing this Agreement. If no consideration is received in the timeline, UTEK has the unilateral option to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the payment timeframe to one (1) day is unreasonable. This could be considered an unconscionable contract term, particularly if the payment method requires more processing time. Many states have prompt payment laws or regulations regarding the timing of payments that deem a 1-day turnaround unreasonable.",

                "explanation": "Extending the period during which MKOS is restricted from directly acquiring technologies presented by UTEK to 60 months (5 years) after termination could be viewed as an unreasonably long non-compete period. Depending on the nature of the technologies and the market, this could be considered an unlawful restraint of trade under state and federal antitrust laws, such as the Sherman Antitrust Act and related state statutes, which prioritize fair competition.",

                "explanation": "Shortening the notice period to 15 days before the deadline for nominating directors may violate state corporate laws or SEC regulations that require a longer period for shareholders to exercise their rights. Similarly, providing only one business day for the Company to remedy a material breach is unreasonable and may be deemed insufficient under Delaware law, where companies are typically afforded a reasonable cure period.",

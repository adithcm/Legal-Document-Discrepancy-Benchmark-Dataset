                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed ten (10) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for noncompliance to 10 days may be considered unreasonably short, especially for complex operational or quality issues. This could potentially conflict with state laws requiring reasonable timeframes for businesses to rectify issues, making it difficult or impossible for the Licensee to comply, leading to potential breach of contract despite good faith efforts.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee. This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon sixty (60) days' written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon sixty (60) days' written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall expire if the Investment Advisor or one of its affiliates ceases to serve as investment adviser to the Licensee. This Agreement shall be terminable (a) by the Licensor (i) at any time and in its sole discretion in the event that the Licensor or the Licensee receives notice of any Third Party Claim arising out of the Licensee's use of the Licensed Mark or (ii) upon fifteen (15) days' written notice by the Licensor to the Licensee or (b) by the Licensee (i) at any time in the event such Licensee assigns or attempts to assign or sublicense this Agreement or any of the Licensee's rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor or (ii) upon fifteen (15) days' written notice by the Licensee to the Licensor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to 15 days might be deemed insufficient under certain state laws that imply a 'reasonable notice' requirement, especially considering the potential impact on the Licensee's business operations and investments tied to the licensed trademark. This could potentially conflict with general contract law principles that emphasize fairness and reasonable notice, especially in situations involving long-term licenses.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the period for disclaimers on public-facing materials after termination to 6 months could be problematic if the Licensor is engaged in ongoing litigation or brand protection efforts that require a longer period to avoid consumer confusion or trademark infringement issues. This change could conflict with trademark law principles that aim to prevent consumer confusion and protect brand integrity, especially if a longer disclaimer period is necessary to achieve those goals. This also disproportionately favors the Licensor.",

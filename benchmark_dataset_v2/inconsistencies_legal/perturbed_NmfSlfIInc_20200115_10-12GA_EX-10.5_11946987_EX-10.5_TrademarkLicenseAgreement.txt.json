                "original_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor Source: NMF SLF I, INC., 10-12G/A, 1/15/2020 to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "changed_text": "Upon written notification by the Licensor Source: NMF SLF I, INC., 10-12G/A, 1/15/2020 to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, within fifteen (15) days, to cure such noncompliance.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for noncompliance to 15 days may be unreasonably short depending on the nature of the noncompliance and the steps required to cure it. This timeframe could be deemed insufficient, potentially leading to disputes and claims of breach of contract if the Licensee is unable to reasonably address the issue within the allotted time.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding reasonableness and fairness; specific regulations related to cure periods in commercial agreements may vary by state (New York) and industry.",

                "changed_text": "For six (6) months following termination of this Agreement, the Licensee shall specify on all public- facing materials in a prominent place and in prominent typeface that the Licensee is no longer operating under the Licensed Mark, is no longer associated with the Licensor, or such other notice as may be deemed necessary by the Licensor in its sole discretion in its prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Third Party Claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the duration of the post-termination notice period to 6 months may be insufficient to protect the Licensor's brand and prevent consumer confusion, especially if the Licensee's operations were closely associated with the Licensed Mark. This shorter period could be challenged as unreasonably limiting the Licensor's ability to protect its trademark rights post-termination, potentially violating trademark law principles related to preventing consumer deception.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notification method to email and stating notices are 'duly given or made when sent' removes the assurance of receipt. Many legal jurisdictions require proof of receipt for important notices. The original clause included methods that provide confirmation of delivery (signature required courier, return receipt requested mail), offering legal protection that the new email-only method lacks. This change could lead to disputes over whether a notice was actually received, especially since email delivery is not always guaranteed.",

Many jurisdictions require proof of receipt for certain notices, particularly in situations involving legal claims or important contractual obligations. State laws (New York) concerning contract enforcement and dispute resolution would be relevant.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the  applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month.",
                "changed_text": "Past due cash payments (i.e., payments due more than thirty (30) days after Berkshire's receipt of the  applicable invoice) shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-five (25%) percent per month.",
                "explanation": "Imposing an interest rate of 25% per month on late payments may violate usury laws in Connecticut, which regulates the maximum interest rate that can be charged on loans and debts. Charging excessively high interest could be considered usurious and lead to legal challenges.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under  clause (i) above, if payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make  payment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have  received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure  each such item of default.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon providing written notice of such breach.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the cure periods for defaults, which are generally required to provide the breaching party a reasonable opportunity to rectify the issue. Under contract law, immediate termination without allowing a cure period may be deemed a breach of contract itself or may not be enforceable, especially if a reasonable cure period would be required under Connecticut law for fair dealing and commercial reasonableness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Connecticut contract law regarding cure periods and reasonable opportunity to cure a breach.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "If the delay referred to above exceeds sixty (60) days (or such other reasonable period taking  into consideration the nature and cause of the delay), either Party may forthwith terminate this Agreement whereupon the Parties shall cease to be  bound by their respective obligations under this Agreement in respect granted under this Agreement shall cease.",
                "changed_text": "If the delay referred to above exceeds ten (10) days, either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the force majeure delay period to ten days is commercially unreasonable and potentially unenforceable under Connecticut law. Courts generally require a more substantial period to account for the realities of force majeure events and to allow parties a reasonable opportunity to resume performance. A ten-day period may be considered too short to address many force majeure circumstances, leading to a finding of unconscionability or a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "changed_text": "The appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) fifteen (15) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless the Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the period for the agent's appointment termination from 45 days to 15 days. This timeline is potentially problematic. Pennsylvania law provides a cooling-off period or specifies particular procedures or review periods for certain types of financial transactions, including securities offerings. Reducing this period to 15 days could put the contract in conflict with consumer protection regulations or securities regulations, if those regulations require a longer period or a specific procedure to terminate the offering.",

                "explanation": "Extending the availability of the earnings statement to 180 days after the close of the period contradicts the requirement to provide it as soon as practicable, and places it far outside the normal reporting timelines expected under the Securities Act. The rule states the report should be provided no later than what is set forth in Section 11(a).",

                "explanation": "Reducing the restricted period for selling shares of Common Stock from 180 days to 30 days can present a conflict. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, lock-up agreements for IPOs and similar offerings typically extend for 180 days (or longer) to prevent market saturation and maintain stock price stability. A 30-day lock-up may be inadequate, especially if there is significant insider or early investor ownership, and it could violate standard underwriting practices or regulatory guidelines if a longer period is expected by regulatory bodies to ensure fair market practices following an offering.",

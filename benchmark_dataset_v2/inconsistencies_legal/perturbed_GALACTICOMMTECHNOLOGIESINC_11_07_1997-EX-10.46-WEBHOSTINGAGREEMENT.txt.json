                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than Wednesday for accesses used from the previuos week (Monday thru Sunday).",
                "changed_text": "Horst Entertainment agrees to pay Galactcomm $0.01 (one cent) per access up to 400,000 accesses thereafter payment shall be $0.005 (one-half cent) per access. Horst Entertainment shall send this amount to Galacticomm by no later than 30 days after the end of the month in which the accesses occurred.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline to 30 days after the month's end contradicts prompt payment laws, which often require more frequent payment intervals, especially for services rendered. This extended delay could violate Florida's prompt payment statutes for services.",
                "contradicted_law": "Likely violates Florida's prompt payment laws, though the specifics depend on whether this arrangement qualifies under those statutes.",

This person(s) must be available by beeper or telephone. Horst Entertainment shall provide this same 24 hour service at the broadcast location.",
                "changed_text": "Galacticomm may provide a person(s) to correct any technical problems (Server being down or inaccessible) during normal business hours, Monday through Friday. The method of contact for technical support is at Galacticomm's sole discretion. Horst Entertainment shall provide 24-hour service.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the technical support availability and granting sole discretion over contact methods could be deemed a breach of contract and a failure to provide essential services, potentially violating implied warranties or consumer protection laws. This lack of continuous support directly contradicts the original agreement's commitment.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and could run afoul of consumer protection laws if the service degradation is significant.",

                "changed_text": "In the event Galacticomm, Inc. chooses to terminate this agreement for any reason, Horst Entertainment Inc. forfeits any right to continued use of the software.",
                "explanation": "Removing Horst Entertainment's right to purchase a license upon termination by Galacticomm may be considered an unfair or unconscionable contract term, especially if Horst Entertainment has invested significantly in the software. This could conflict with principles of good faith and fair dealing and potentially violate contract law regarding unfair terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, and could be challenged as an unconscionable contract term.",

If such period is greater than ten (10) business days then this Sub-Reseller Agreement shall be deemed null and void and to be of no effect.",

If such period is greater than one hundred eighty (180) business days then this Sub-Reseller Agreement shall be deemed null and void and to be of no effect.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement states that if the signature dates are separated by more than 10 business days, the agreement is void. Extending this period to 180 days could create enforceability issues, especially if one party attempts to withdraw before the 180-day period elapses. Contract law requires agreements to be entered into with reasonable promptness, and such an extended window might be deemed unreasonable, especially in a rapidly changing business environment.",

                "explanation": "The removal of the sentence requiring the Reseller to ensure the Sub-Reseller's compliance creates a potential legal issue. Typically, in sub-contracting or reseller arrangements, the primary contractor (Reseller) has a duty to ensure their sub-contractors (Sub-Reseller) comply with the main contract. Removing this obligation could violate standard agency law principles.",

                "explanation": "By stating that breaches by the Sub-Reseller will only be addressed directly between SFDC and Sub-Reseller, the agreement attempts to absolve the Reseller of responsibility for the actions of their sub-reseller. This could conflict with the principles of agency law, where a principal (SFDC) can often hold an agent (Reseller) liable for the actions of a sub-agent (Sub-Reseller), particularly if the sub-agent's actions cause damages.",

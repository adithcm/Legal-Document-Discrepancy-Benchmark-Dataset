If HOC wishes to exercise the Option, it shall give written notice to the Company (the \"Option Exercise Notice\") prior to the Option Expiration Date in the manner set forth in Section 12.1 of this Agreement. If HOC fails to deliver the Option Exercise Notice on or before the Option Expiration Date, HOC shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 2.1. In the event HOC exercises the Option, one or more of the HOC Entities shall subscribe and pay for and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, the Additional Shares and the Parties shall exchange representations and warranties substantially similar to those contained in the Subscription Agreement and execute such documents as may be necessary to complete the subscription and sale of the Additional Shares. Closing of the purchase and sale of the Additional Shares shall take place within ten (10) business days of the delivery of the Option Exercise Notice, such date being referred to as the \"Subsequent Closing Date\".",

                "explanation": "Shortening the option expiration date to 20 days and extending the closing date to 30 business days introduces potential conflicts. While there isn't a single, universal law dictating option periods for private contracts, unreasonably short timeframes can raise concerns about fairness, due diligence, and potential coercion, especially if it significantly disadvantages one party. Furthermore, extending the closing date to 30 business days after the option is exercised, grants undue time to the buyer and may go against market convention. If this delay is seen as detrimental or commercially unreasonable, it could be challenged.",

If HOC delivers the Financing Election, the purchase price for each share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the average closing price of the Shares during the thirty (30) calendar days preceding the date HOC delivers the Financing Election. Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than ten (10) days from delivery of the Financing Election.",
                "changed_text": "HOC shall have two (2) Business Days from delivery of such notice in which to notify the Company that it desires to provide all of such financing (the \"Financing Election\"). If HOC delivers the Financing Election, the purchase price for each share shall be equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the average closing price of the Shares during the five (5) calendar days preceding the date HOC delivers the Financing Election. Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than thirty (30) days from delivery of the Financing Election.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the Financing Election notification period to two business days creates an unreasonably short timeframe for HOC to conduct due diligence and make a significant financial decision. Decreasing the calculation period for the share price to five days, in combination with the increased purchase price, can disadvantage HOC. Increasing the closing period to 30 days after election further shifts the power to Hochschild Mining, and depending on market conditions and applicable state law, the price and closing period may violate market standards.",

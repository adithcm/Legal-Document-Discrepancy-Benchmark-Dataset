                "original_text": "A late payment charge of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by applicable law shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "A late payment charge of five percent (5%) per month shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than ten (10) days.",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the grace period for late payments to 10 days and increases the late payment charge to 5% per month. This contradicts usury laws in many states and countries that place a cap on the maximum interest rate that can be charged. Many jurisdictions limit late fees on commercial transactions.",

                "original_text": "Distributor shall inspect all Products immediately upon delivery and shall, within seven (7) calendar days, give written notice to the common cartier and Developer of any claim for damages or shortages. Distributor shall give written notice to Developer within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery in the event that any Product does not conform with the terms of this Agreement. If Distributor fails to give any such notice, the Products shall be deemed accepted for all purposes of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Distributor shall inspect all Products immediately upon delivery and shall, within two (2) calendar days, give written notice to the common carrier and Developer of any claim for damages or shortages. Distributor shall give written notice to Developer within fifteen (15) calendar days of delivery in the event that any Product does not conform with the terms of this Agreement. If Distributor fails to give any such notice, the Products shall be deemed accepted for all purposes of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows 7 days for claims regarding damages and shortages, and 30 days for products not conforming to the agreement. This edit modifies the timelines to 2 and 15 days respectively. This change is a legal contradiction because such short claim periods may be deemed unreasonable under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which implies a reasonable time for inspection and rejection. Limiting the inspection window to 2 days for damages or shortages is likely insufficient, especially for complex Products. Similarly, 15 days may not be adequate to identify non-conformities.",

                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after the termination hereof for any reason, Distributor will not market, or attempt to market, a computer program which competes in any way with the Products in the areas of consolidation, financial information, financial transaction processing, reporting, data collection, or modeling, including but not limited to the use of personal computers, nor which competes with any modification, alteration or enhancement to the Products which is developed during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years after the termination hereof for any reason, Distributor will not market, or attempt to market, any product whatsoever in the Territory.",
                "explanation": "This change expands the non-compete clause to prohibit the Distributor from marketing *any* product in the Territory for five years after termination. This is likely an unreasonable restraint of trade, especially considering the original clause was limited to competing computer programs. Such a broad restriction is likely unenforceable under Connecticut law and similar laws in other jurisdictions, as it unduly restricts the Distributor's ability to earn a living. The restriction is not narrowly tailored to protect the Developer's legitimate business interests and is excessively long.",

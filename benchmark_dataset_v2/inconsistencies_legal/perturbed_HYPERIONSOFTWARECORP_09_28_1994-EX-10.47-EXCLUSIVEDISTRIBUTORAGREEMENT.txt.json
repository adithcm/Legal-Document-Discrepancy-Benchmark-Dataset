                "original_text": "Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest interest rate allowed by applicable law shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than thirty (30) days.",
                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees and expenses payable hereunder for which Developer issues an invoice to Distributor shall be due and payable sixty (60) days from the date of the invoice. A late payment charge of five percent (5%) per month shall be charged upon all unpaid amounts due hereunder for more than sixty (60) days.",
                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates payment within 30 days with a 1.5% late fee. The modified contract extends the payment term to 60 days and increases the late payment charge to 5% per month. This may contradict usury laws or other regulations in some US states (default jurisdiction) that limit the amount of late fees or interest that can be charged. If the contract defaults to Connecticut law as stipulated in 10.2 Jurisdiction and Venue, the rate of 5% may be above the legal rate.",

Upon written notice from Distributor of defective media for a Product, Developer may provide replacement media at their own discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a warranty period of 90 days. This modification reduces the warranty period to 30 days and makes the provision of replacement media discretionary. This shortened warranty period and discretionary replacement conflicts with implied warranties of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which some states interpret as requiring a reasonable warranty period. Also, the UCC requires good faith, which might conflict with developer's discretion.",

Either party may cancel this Agreement effective on the last day of the Initial Term, or any Renewal Term, by serving written notice of such termination on the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term as the case may be.",

Either party may cancel this Agreement effective immediately, without prior notice, at any time.",
                "explanation": "The original clause stipulates a 30-day notice period for cancellation due to unmet revenue forecasts and a 90-day notice period for termination at the end of a term. This is changed to allow immediate cancellation without notice. This lack of notice period is likely to be considered a breach of good faith and fair dealing, which is implied in most US contracts. Sudden termination without notice may cause significant damages to the distributor, making the clause unenforceable.",

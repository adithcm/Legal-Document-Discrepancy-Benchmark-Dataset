                "explanation": "Reducing the non-compete period to 6 months could be deemed unreasonably short depending on industry standards and the specific knowledge Western Copper gained. Courts often scrutinize non-compete agreements to ensure the duration is no longer than necessary to protect the employer's legitimate business interests. A 6-month period may be viewed as insufficient in the mining industry, thus creating a legal challenge to its enforceability.",

In  the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash  consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for  the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property.

For a period of  5 days from the time of delivery of the Disposition Notice Glamis will, if requested by Western  Silver, entertain an offer from Western Copper to acquire the Designated Mineral Property. In  the ease of a Designated Mineral Property that Glamis intends to dispose of for cash  consideration, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable agreement for  the sale to Western Copper of the [Designated Mineral Property.

                "explanation": "Reducing the negotiation period for the Right of First Offer from 30 days to 5 days and the disposal period from 3 months to 1 month is likely insufficient for complex mining property valuations and due diligence. This could be deemed commercially unreasonable, especially given the potential for significant financial implications. A court might find that 5 days does not provide Western Copper with adequate time to assess the property and secure financing, thereby undermining the purpose of the Right of First Offer.",

                "explanation": "Removing the 'time is of the essence' clause can create uncertainty and potential conflicts, particularly if the contract involves deadlines or specific performance requirements. This directly contradicts the common legal understanding that 'time is of the essence' means strict adherence to deadlines is critical, and failure to meet those deadlines constitutes a material breach. Eliminating this clause could lead to disputes over what constitutes a reasonable delay and whether a breach has occurred, introducing legal ambiguity and increasing the potential for litigation.",

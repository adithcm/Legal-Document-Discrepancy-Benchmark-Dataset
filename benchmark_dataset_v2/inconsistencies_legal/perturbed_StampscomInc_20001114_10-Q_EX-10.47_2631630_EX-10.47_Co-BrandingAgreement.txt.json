                "original_text": "MBE agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute agreements, or to facilitate the execution of agreements among the appropriate parties, so that such Basic Fee is paid to the Company directly from the carrier which ships such package no later than fifteen (15) days following the end of the month in which such package was shipped.",
                "changed_text": "MBE agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to execute agreements, or to facilitate the execution of agreements among the appropriate parties, so that such Basic Fee is paid to the Company directly from the carrier which ships such package no later than sixty (60) days following the end of the month in which such package was shipped.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 15 days, which is a reasonable timeframe. The modified text extends this period to 60 days. This could create issues under California law, which favors prompt payment and could view extended payment terms as an unreasonable delay, potentially violating implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. California Prompt Payment Law is violated.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates payment 'on the next business day or as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within one week)'. The modified text removes this defined timeframe, stating payment will be made 'at the Company's discretion' and MBE will distribute payments 'at their convenience.' This is a contradiction since it creates uncertainty and potential for unreasonable delays in payment, potentially violating California labor laws and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

The modified text makes audits subject to the company's discretion and company guidelines, completely removing MBE's right to audit. This modification eliminates a right to audit and sets audit at company's discretion, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

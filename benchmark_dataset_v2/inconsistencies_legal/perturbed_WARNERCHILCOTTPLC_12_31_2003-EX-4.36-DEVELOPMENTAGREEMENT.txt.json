                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, GALEN will pay to LEO US$5,000,000 (five million United States dollars) to reimburse LEO for a portion of the actual development costs that have been incurred by LEO. This payment is non-refundable.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days after the FDA approval, GALEN will pay to LEO US$5,000,000 (five million United States dollars) to reimburse LEO for a portion of the actual development costs that have been incurred by LEO. This payment is non-refundable. After one year of receiving payment LEO must return the full payment amount back to GALEN.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction. While the original text specifies a clear payment deadline, the modification adds a condition that LEO must refund the payment amount after a year. This could be construed as an unenforceable penalty or illegal financial obligation under contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding penalties and enforceability of financial obligations.",
                "location": "Article 3.3"

                "original_text": "This Article V shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of ten (10) years, provided, however, that following the termination of this Agreement LEO shall be free to use all data, information or other confidential information relating to the Combination Product and following termination of this Agreement, GALEN shall be free to use all GALEN Information.",
                "changed_text": "This Article V shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of one (1) year, provided, however, that following the termination of this Agreement LEO shall be free to use all data, information or other confidential information relating to the Combination Product and following termination of this Agreement, GALEN shall be free to use all GALEN Information.",
                "explanation": "The reduction of the confidentiality period to one (1) year creates a legal contradiction. Trade secrets and confidential information often require longer protection periods to maintain their competitive advantage. A one-year period may be deemed insufficient under trade secret laws, potentially violating state and federal regulations protecting proprietary information, such as the Defend Trade Secrets Act.",
                "contradicted_law": "Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and state trade secret laws.",

                "original_text": "In the event that one of the Parties hereto materially defaults or breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days' written notice, provided, however, that if the Party in default, within the sixty day period referred to, remedies the said default or breach, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that one of the Parties hereto materially defaults or breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days' written notice, provided, however, that if the Party in default, within the five day period referred to, remedies the said default or breach, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from sixty (60) days to five (5) days creates a legal contradiction. Under contract law, a reasonable cure period must be provided to the breaching party. Five days may be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex breaches, making the termination clause potentially unenforceable. This violates general principles of contract law regarding fairness and reasonable opportunity to cure.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding reasonable notice and opportunity to cure a breach.",

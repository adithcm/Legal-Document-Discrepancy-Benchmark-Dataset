                "original_text": "4.4.1 Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at least once per three (3) months at such place and time as set forth in notices provided to the Directors at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of such meeting. Special meetings of the Board shall be held upon notice of not less than three (3) Business Days setting forth an agenda or purpose for the meeting; provided, however, that any Director may waive compliance with such notice requirement before or after the meeting. Special meetings of the Board may be called by at least two (2) Directors upon three (3) Business Days' notice to the Chairman, which notice shall include an agenda for such meeting.",
                "changed_text": "4.4.1 Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at least once per year at such place and time as the Chairman deems appropriate. Special meetings of the Board shall be held upon notice of not less than one (1) Business Day setting forth an agenda or purpose for the meeting; Directors may waive compliance with such notice requirement at any time. Special meetings of the Board may be called by any Director upon one (1) Business Day's notice to the Chairman, which notice shall include an agenda for such meeting.",
                "explanation": "The changes reduce the frequency of mandatory board meetings, shorten the notice period for special meetings to one business day, and allow directors to waive notice requirements at any time. Delaware law requires reasonable notice for board meetings, which is not clearly defined but generally implies more than one business day, especially for significant decisions. Reducing the meeting frequency and allowing immediate waiver of notice create inconsistencies with standard corporate governance practices and fiduciary duties expected under Delaware law.",

If, after the Effective Date, TPH or TPH-A shall have materially breached any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or shall have failed to comply in any material respect with any of the other covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure shall not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof (the \"Default Notice\") has been given by AFSL to TPH/TPH-A, then AFSL shall have the option of purchasing from TPH-A, and TPH-A shall be obligated to sell, all of the Shares then owned by TPH-A at a purchase price per Share equal to the lesser of: (i) the Net Book Value as of the most recent month end (provided that, if the Net Book Value is a negative amount, the product of the Net Book Value multiplied by such Sale Shares shall be deemed to be one Japanese Yen (¥1)), or (ii) the Shares Purchase Price, divided by the number of Sale Shares. AFSL shall provide written notice of its election (the \"Election Notice\") to purchase the Shares owned by TPH-A within ten (10) Business Days following the expiration of the thirty (30) day cure period set forth in the Default Notice. The closing of the purchase of the Shares owned by TPH-A shall take place within thirty (30) Business Days following the date of the Election Notice, or at such other time as the Parties may mutually agree. At such closing, AFSL shall deliver to TPH-A, by wire transfer, the full amount of the purchase price in Japanese Yen for such Shares as provided in this Section 7.5.1 against delivery by TPH-A of the following: (a) a sale agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to AFSL containing among other things, a representation and warranty of TPH-A that it is, and AFSL shall be, the beneficial owner of such Shares, with good title thereto, free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances; (b) documentary evidence reasonably satisfactory to AFSL of the transfer to it of all of TPH-A's Shares and (c) resignations of all Directors, if any, on the Board appointed by TPH-A. Notwithstanding the remedies provided in this Section 7.5.1, AFSL/FSL shall be entitled to all other remedies against TPH/TPH-A available at law or equity or under this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The modified text removes the cure period for breaches, drastically reduces the time frame for exercising the call option and closing the purchase, fixes the purchase price at a nominal amount (¥1), removes the 'reasonableness' standard for the sale agreement, and omits any mention of existing liens. By removing the cure period and setting a nominal price, the provision creates an oppressive and potentially unconscionable penalty for breach, conflicting with basic principles of contract law regarding fairness and reasonable remedies. Under Delaware law, penalties disproportionate to actual damages are often unenforceable.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Any payment due pursuant to this Section that is not received by SDBF within fifteen (15) days after such payment is due shall bear interest from the date the payment was due until paid, at a per annum rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus five (5) percentage points, or if such interest rate is not permitted by applicable law, at the highest non-usurious interest rate permitted by applicable law.",
                "changed_text": "Any payment due pursuant to this Section that is not received by SDBF within five (5) days after such payment is due shall bear interest from the date the payment was due until paid, at a per annum rate of interest equal to the prime rate of interest as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus twenty-five (25) percentage points, or if such interest rate is not permitted by applicable law, at the highest non-usurious interest rate permitted by applicable law.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the grace period for late payments from 15 days to 5 days and increases the interest rate to prime plus 25 percentage points. California law sets limits on the maximum interest rate that can be charged, especially in consumer or small business contexts. A rate of prime plus 25% could easily exceed these usury limits, making the clause unenforceable and potentially illegal.",

                "changed_text": "In the event of cancellation, non-renewal or material modification SDBF shall receive ten (10) days written notice thereof.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for insurance policy changes to 10 days may violate California Insurance Code provisions that require insurers to provide adequate notice (often 30 days or more) to policyholders and other interested parties like SDBF before cancellation or material modification of a policy. This ensures sufficient time to secure replacement coverage.",

                "original_text": "Sponsor shall not claim prevention of or interference with performance of Sponsor's obligations pursuant to this Agreement or the suspension or termination of Sponsor's obligations under this Agreement as the result of any default under this Agreement, without first giving a copy of any notice of default or termination to the Collateral Trustee and providing the Collateral Trustee with the opportunity to cure any such default within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of such notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a default notice to the Collateral Trustee from 120 days to 15 days is highly likely to be considered unreasonable, especially in cases of complex financial defaults. Such a short cure period could be deemed commercially unreasonable and potentially unenforceable under California law, which emphasizes fairness and good faith in contractual performance.",

By preventing Zogenix from receiving sub-distributor agreements, it hinders Zogenix's ability to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws (like FCPA) and contractual obligations, potentially leading to legal liabilities. This lack of transparency violates the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in most contracts.",

Within ten (10) days after a committee meeting, the secretary of such committee shall prepare and distribute to all members of such committee draft minutes of the meeting. Such minutes shall provide a list of any issues yet to be resolved, either within such committee or through the relevant resolution process.\n\n3.3.2 Review of Minutes. The Party members of each committee shall have ten (10) days after receiving such draft minutes to collect comments thereon and provide them to the secretary of such committee.\n\n3.3.3 Discussion of Comments.

There is no fixed deadline for completion or distribution of minutes.\n\n3.3.1 Distribution of Minutes. The secretary of each committee will prepare and distribute draft minutes at their convenience. The minutes will only include resolved items.\n\n3.3.2 Review of Minutes. The Party members of each committee will review minutes only if they find the time to do so.\n\n3.3.3 Discussion of Comments. The secretary and chairperson(s) of such committee will each sign and date the final minutes. Silence from the members indicates agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes any mandatory deadlines for finalizing and distributing minutes. It also alters the process so that silence indicates agreement. This contradicts standard corporate governance practices and legal expectations for accurate record-keeping and transparency in decision-making, making the decision-making process vague and unauditable.",

Subject to any Third Party rights existing as of the Effective Date, each Party shall submit to the Joint Project Committee for review and approval all proposed academic, scientific and medical publications and public presentations relating to a Collaboration Product or any research or Development activities under this Agreement for review in connection with preservation of Patent Rights, and trade secrets and/or to determine whether Confidential Information should be modified or deleted from the proposed publication or public presentation.

The review period may be extended for an additional sixty (60) days if a representative of the non-publishing Party on the Joint Project Committee can demonstrate a reasonable need for such extension including, but not limited to, the preparation and filing of patent applications. By mutual agreement of the Parties, this period may be further extended. The Parties will each comply with standard academic practice regarding authorship of scientific publications and recognition of contribution of other parties in any publications relating to the Collaboration Products or any research or Development activities under this Agreement.",

It constrains academic freedom and research publication practices, potentially violating principles related to open science and creating restrictions that would be considered unreasonable. It also reduces required turn around time, thereby reducing the capacity of Theravance to act.",

                "original_text": "FASC shall give prompt notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section; provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall not lessen the obligation of the Adviser to indemnify FASC except to the extent it results in actual prejudice.",
                "changed_text": "FASC shall give notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section within 180 days; provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall lessen the obligation of the Adviser to indemnify FASC regardless of actual prejudice.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires 'prompt notice,' implying a reasonable timeframe. The modification specifies a 180-day notice period, which, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the claim, might be considered unreasonably long and prejudicial to the Adviser's ability to investigate and defend against the claim. Furthermore, removing the 'actual prejudice' requirement makes the notice provision overly punitive, as any delay, regardless of its impact, voids indemnification. This may violate fairness and good faith principles in contract law.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall assume the defense of the claim, and FASC shall cooperate with the Adviser in such defense, subject to the obligation of the Adviser to reimburse FASC for the expenses resulting therefrom. In the event Adviser gives notice that it will assume the defense of any claim, the Adviser shall not be obligated to indemnify FASC for any further legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending such claim, except those incurred at the request of the Adviser or its counsel. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, except with the prior written consent of the Adviser or unless the Adviser fails, within 30 days after notice of the terms of such settlement, to notify FASC that it has assumed the defense of such claim and will indemnify FASC for any liability resulting therefrom.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall assume the defense of the claim, and FASC shall cooperate with the Adviser in such defense, but the Adviser has no obligation to reimburse FASC for any expenses. In the event Adviser gives notice that it will assume the defense of any claim, the Adviser shall not be obligated to indemnify FASC for any further legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending such claim, regardless of who incurred such expense. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, except with the prior written consent of the Adviser or unless the Adviser fails, within 5 days after notice of the terms of such settlement, to notify FASC that it has assumed the defense of such claim and will indemnify FASC for any liability resulting therefrom.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause removes the Adviser's obligation to reimburse FASC for expenses incurred while cooperating in the defense, even when the Adviser has assumed the defense. It also modifies the notification period for settlement terms to 5 days. Depending on the complexity of the claim, five days may be insufficient time for the Adviser to reasonably assess the settlement terms and make a decision, potentially forcing FASC into an unfavorable settlement or relinquishing control without proper evaluation. This could violate the implied duty of good faith.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires 60 days written notice for termination. The modified clause reduces this to 10 days. For investment advisory agreements, a longer notice period might be legally required to ensure an orderly transition of services and protect the interests of the clients or accounts managed under the agreement. A sudden termination could disrupt services and potentially violate fiduciary duties to clients.",

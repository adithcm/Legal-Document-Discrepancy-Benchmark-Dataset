                "changed_text": "For any Product or Solution sold to any perspective clients introduced by Bravatek registered with COMPANY via email to COMPANY's CEO and delivered through Bravatek or a COMPANY-designated distribution affiliate(s) or sales channel(s), Bravatek will receive a lead-finder fee, to be mutually discussed and finally decided by COMPANY at the range of minimum of 10% to maximum of 20% of project revenue, with an exact fee to be depending upon the overall project sales margin and cost of development and delivery of each project, payable NET 90 days after each client payment on delivered products received at COMPANY's bank account.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment term from NET 30 days to NET 90 days. This could create issues under certain state prompt payment laws, which require businesses to pay contractors and subcontractors within a shorter timeframe, potentially violating such laws if the payment is delayed beyond what the law allows.",

                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the date hereof, and will be automatically renewed for one (1) additional twelve month period unless either party shall notify the other in writing of its intention not to renew. Such notice must be given thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the original term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notification period from 90 days to 30 days could be problematic. Depending on the specific industry and the nature of the strategic alliance, a 30-day notice period might be deemed unreasonably short, especially if significant investments or preparations are involved, potentially leading to disputes and claims of insufficient notice under contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "changed_text": "For a period of one (1) year after termination of this Agreement, the parties shall treat as confidential all information and take every reasonable precaution and use all reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the same.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality term from 5 years to 1 year. Given the agreement relates to a strategic alliance around patented technology, reducing the confidentiality period to one year introduces risk. The information may have an economic life beyond one year, creating a conflict with established trade secret protection principles. Some trade secrets can maintain protection indefinitely as long as they are kept secret. The reduced period could be deemed insufficient to protect the value of the trade secrets.",

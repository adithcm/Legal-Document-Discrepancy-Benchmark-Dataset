                "original_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Required Consents with regard to Transferred Third Party Agreements and Third Party Use Rights within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.",
                "changed_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Required Consents with regard to Transferred Third Party Agreements and Third Party Use Rights within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the time frame for obtaining required consents from 180 days to 30 days. Depending on the complexity and number of third-party agreements, 30 days might be insufficient to comply with due diligence and regulatory requirements for obtaining consents for transferring agreements, potentially violating regulations related to contract assignments or intellectual property transfer.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies depending on the jurisdiction and the specific third-party agreements involved, potentially violating contract law principles of reasonable time for performance and due diligence requirements for asset transfers.",

                "changed_text": "Certegy will terminate the use of such Equifax Marks at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the termination of the Equifax Marks optional and undefined, potentially violating trademark law principles related to license termination and proper usage of trademarks, creating non-compliance with regulatory standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trademark law principles requiring licensees to adhere to the terms of the license, including termination timelines and conditions.",

                "explanation": "This change shortens the allowed time for Certegy to transition off shared software and hardware from two years to one year. Depending on the complexity of the systems and the dependencies between Equifax and Certegy, one year may not be a reasonable timeframe to effect such a separation. This could violate regulatory requirements that ensure business continuity and proper IT infrastructure separation, which are often part of merger or spin-off agreements.",

                "original_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Required Consents with regard to Transferred Third Party Agreements and Third Party Use Rights within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. Until all Required Consents are obtained, Equifax and Certegy shall each periodically publish a list setting forth the status of each Required Consent for which a member of its respective Group is the contracting party immediately prior to the Closing Date. Equifax and Certegy shall timely cooperate with each other in order to facilitate the proper and timely publication of such periodic Required Consents list.",
                "changed_text": "Equifax and Certegy shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Required Consents with regard to Transferred Third Party Agreements and Third Party Use Rights within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. Until all Required Consents are obtained, Equifax and Certegy shall each periodically publish a list setting forth the status of each Required Consent for which a member of its respective Group is the contracting party immediately prior to the Closing Date. Equifax and Certegy can delay cooperation with each other to not facilitate the proper and timely publication of such periodic Required Consents list.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the timeframe for obtaining Required Consents from 180 days to 30 days, which may not be commercially reasonable or feasible, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing. The second part about not facilitating the publication of the Required consents also creates a breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The modification eliminates the deadline for terminating the use of Equifax Marks, which could lead to trademark infringement or unfair competition issues if Certegy continues to use the marks indefinitely without permission.",

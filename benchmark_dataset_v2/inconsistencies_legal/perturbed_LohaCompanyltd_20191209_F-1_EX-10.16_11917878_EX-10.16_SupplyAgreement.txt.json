                "original_text": "2.2 The seller shall be confirmed within three working days after receipt of order. If the seller finds order is not acceptable or need to modify, should note entrusted party in two working days after receipt of the order, If the seller did not confirm orders in time or notice not accept orders or modifications, the seller is deemed to have been accepted the order. The orders become effective once the seller accepts, any party shall not unilaterally cancel the order before the two sides agreed .",
                "changed_text": "2.2 The seller shall confirm receipt of the order at their earliest convenience. If the seller finds the order unacceptable or requires modification, they should notify the entrusted party at their earliest convenience. Failure to promptly confirm or communicate regarding the order does not constitute acceptance. Orders become effective upon mutual agreement, but either party retains the right to cancel unilaterally up to the point of shipment.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a strict timeframe (3 working days) for order confirmation, implying automatic acceptance if unconfirmed. The modified text removes this timeframe, allowing for indefinite delays in confirmation and introducing a unilateral cancellation clause. This conflicts with contract law principles requiring definite terms and mutual obligations, and potentially violates the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), which promotes good faith and reasonable deadlines.",

CLAIMS: Within 7 days after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract except those claims for which the insurance company or the owners of the vessel are liable, the Buyers, on the strength of the Inspection Certificate issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau, have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses (such as inspection charges, freight for returning the goods and for sending the replacement, insurance premium, storage and loading and unloading charges etc.) shall be borne by the Sellers.",

CLAIMS: Within 1 day after the arrival of the goods at destination, should the quality, specification, or quantity be found not in conformity with the stipulations of the Contract, the Buyers have the right to claim for replacement with new goods, or for compensation, and all the expenses shall be borne by the Sellers.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the claim period to 1 day after arrival is an extremely short time frame that would contradict the standard claim windows provided under many jurisdictions' sales of goods laws. It creates an unreasonable burden on the buyer to inspect and document any discrepancies within such a short period. By reducing this time drastically, it contradicts laws designed to offer reasonable time for inspection and claim filings.",

                "original_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes, the Buyers are entitled to an unlimited penalty, to be decided at the sole discretion of the Buyer. The rate of penalty is at the Buyer's sole discretion. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery one week later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers shall furthermore be liable for damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, and reputational damage.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a cap on the penalty for late delivery (5% of the total value). The modified version removes this cap, granting the buyer unlimited discretion to impose penalties. This lacks the principle of good faith and fair dealing, and is likely unenforceable under most jurisdictions. Furthermore, reducing the grace period for cancellation to one week and adding liability for consequential damages creates excessively punitive terms that may be deemed unconscionable.",

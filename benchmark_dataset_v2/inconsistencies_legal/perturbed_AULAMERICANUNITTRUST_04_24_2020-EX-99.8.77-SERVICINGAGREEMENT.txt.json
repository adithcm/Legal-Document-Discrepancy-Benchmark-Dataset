                "explanation": "This change alters the payment terms to be paid quarterly instead of monthly and paid out in ninety (90) days instead of thirty (30) days which is in contradiction to general standards of quick payments. These standards make sure the payments are given in a timely manner.",

This delay conflicts with Rule 22c-2, which dictates that the fund, or a financial intermediary, act promptly upon request by the fund's adviser. Extending the execution timeframe to 15 days may be an issue if that execution impacts an investors position in the fund.",

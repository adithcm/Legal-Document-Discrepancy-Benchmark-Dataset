                "original_text": "In the event a Party divests a line of business or line of products or services by (a) spinning off a member of its Group by its sale or other disposition to a Third Party, (b) reducing ownership or control in a member of its Group so that it no longer qualifiers as a member of its Group under this Agreement, (c) selling or otherwise transferring such line of business, products or services to a Third Party or (d) forming a joint venture with a Third Party with respect to such line of business, products or services (each such divested entity or line of business, products or services, a \"Divested Entity\"), the Divested Entity shall retain those licenses granted to it under this Agreement, provided that the license shall be limited to the business, products or services (as applicable) of the Divested Entity as of the date of divestment and such natural development thereof within the Nuance Field of Use (where Nuance is the divesting Party) or SpinCo Field of Use (where SpinCo is the divesting party). The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity's and, in the event it is acquired by a Third Party, such Third Party's execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the deadline from 90 days to 180 days introduces a potential legal contradiction. Some jurisdictions may have laws that specify a maximum timeframe for actions related to the transfer of licenses or intellectual property rights following a divestment. By extending the deadline, the agreement risks conflicting with these legal limitations, potentially rendering this clause unenforceable or creating legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "The change alters the conditions under which a notice is considered 'duly given.' Specifically, removing the requirement for 'written confirmation of receipt' for email notices and extending the timeframe for standard mail to ten business days contradicts standard commercial practice and could violate legal requirements for timely notice in certain jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions legally require confirmation of receipt for critical communications. Moreover, making standard mail ten days to receive is unreasonable.",

                "original_text": "If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances, or in jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision.",
                "changed_text": "If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, all provisions become void and the agreement is terminated. There will be no revised replacement of the provision.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the entire agreement becomes void upon a single provision being deemed invalid, the modification contradicts the principle of severability commonly upheld in contract law. Most jurisdictions prefer to sever the invalid provision and enforce the remainder of the agreement unless the invalid provision is integral to the agreement's purpose. This change makes the entire agreement contingent on each individual clause's validity, increasing the risk of the entire contract being unenforceable and contradicting common legal practice.",

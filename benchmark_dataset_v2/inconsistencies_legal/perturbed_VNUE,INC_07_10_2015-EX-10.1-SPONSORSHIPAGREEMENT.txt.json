                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "$50,000 due upon receipt of this term sheet   $25,000 final balance payment due upon announcement date of July 15, 2015.",
                "changed_text": "$50,000 due upon receipt of this term sheet   $25,000 final balance payment due 120 days after announcement date of July 15, 2015.",
                "explanation": "This modification extends the final payment deadline to 120 days after the announcement date. California law, which governs this agreement, requires specific payment terms to be clearly defined. Extending the payment drastically without defining reasonable reasons for delay could be seen as an unfair business practice or a violation of implied covenant of good faith, especially if it impacts VNUE's ability to operate.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Commercial Code regarding good faith and fair dealing; potential violation of implied covenant of good faith if the delay is unreasonable or causes undue hardship.",

If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",
                "changed_text": "The Sponsor will have 5 days from receipt of the Notice to accept the terms to be the category sponsor of the 2014 Event. If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the response time to 5 days puts undue pressure on the sponsor to make a significant decision, which could be considered an unfair business practice. This may contradict the general principles of contract law requiring a reasonable opportunity to review and consider the terms of a renewal offer. The law expects fair deadlines when presenting contract options.",

Any communication or payment given by mail will be effective upon the earlier of (a) five business days following deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service; or (b) actual receipt, as indicated by the return receipt.",

Any communication or payment given by mail will be effective 30 days following deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the effective date of communication to 30 days after mailing is commercially unreasonable and conflicts with common business practice. It also goes against standard practices for legal notices, which require a quicker notification. This extended timeframe could potentially undermine legal requirements for prompt notice, especially where immediate action is required upon notification.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding reasonable notice; potential conflict with statutes requiring prompt notice in certain legal contexts (e.g., breach of contract, termination).",

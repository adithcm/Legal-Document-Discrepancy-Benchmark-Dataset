                "explanation": "Extending the payment terms to 90 days may violate the Prompt Payment Act, which ensures timely payments to contractors and subcontractors. The Prompt Payment Act (and similar state laws) often sets shorter deadlines than 90 days, especially for government contracts, which can influence general standards for reasonable payment terms.",

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand that the postponing of the delivery of the Terpene Product pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement, shall not be a cause for termination of the Term.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to 10 days for a material breach could be considered unconscionable or a violation of good faith and fair dealing, particularly in Delaware (governing law) where a reasonable opportunity to cure is generally implied. It could be seen as insufficient time to rectify a complex breach, making the termination clause unduly harsh.",

                "explanation": "Setting the timeframe for when notices are considered sufficient after transmitted can contradict state laws if the timeframe is too extended. Some state laws mandate more strict delivery expectations, especially depending on the information transmitted.",

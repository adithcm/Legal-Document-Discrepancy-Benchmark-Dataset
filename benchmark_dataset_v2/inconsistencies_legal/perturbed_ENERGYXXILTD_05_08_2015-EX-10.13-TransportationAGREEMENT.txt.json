                "original_text": "10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 10 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith, provided that if any such amount is later determined to have been due Transporter Section 10.2 below shall apply to such amount.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 60 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith, provided that if any such amount is later determined to have been due Transporter Section 10.2 below shall apply to such amount.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that payments are due within 10 days of invoice receipt, a fairly standard business practice. By extending the payment window to 60 days, it creates inconsistency with common commercial practices. Many jurisdictions have prompt payment laws or regulations that might consider such an extended payment term unreasonable, especially without any specific justification. This is particularly true for smaller businesses or subcontractors who rely on timely payments to manage their cash flow.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-level prompt payment laws or general principles of 'reasonable' commercial practice under contract law; UCC Article 2 may imply reasonable time for payment.",

                "original_text": "11.4 Claims. As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within one year and one day after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within one year and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within two years and one day from the date of delivery, or within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter shall not be liable and such claims will not be paid.",
                "changed_text": "11.4 Claims. As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within 30 days after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within 30 days after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within six months from the date of delivery, or within six months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter shall not be liable and such claims will not be paid.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a one-year-and-one-day window for filing claims and a two-year-and-one-day period for instituting suits. By reducing these periods to 30 days and six months respectively, the modified clause significantly shortens the time available for shippers to discover and pursue legitimate claims. This may contradict statutes of limitations or principles of fairness that require a reasonable opportunity to investigate and litigate claims, particularly in cases involving latent defects or complex damages.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with state statutes of limitations for breach of contract or negligence claims; may violate principles of unconscionability if the shortened timeframes are deemed unreasonably restrictive.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause survives termination for one year. Reducing this to 90 days is problematic because trade secrets, customer lists, and other confidential information require longer protection. A 90-day period might be deemed insufficient to protect sensitive business data, especially in an industry where competitive advantages are built over the long term.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially inadequate protection of trade secrets under state or federal law (e.g., the Defend Trade Secrets Act) if the 90-day survival period is deemed insufficient to prevent misappropriation or unfair competition.",

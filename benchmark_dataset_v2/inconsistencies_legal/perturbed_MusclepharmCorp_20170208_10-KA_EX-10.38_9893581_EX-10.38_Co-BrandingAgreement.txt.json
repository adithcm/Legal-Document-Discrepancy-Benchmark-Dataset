Each such royalty payment shall include an itemized statement showing the nature and source of such royalties, including (i) the number of units of Licensed Products sold (by country and customer); (ii) the total number of units returned for which credit was given and the total dollar amount of such credits, and (iii) the total gross sales and the total royalties due with respect to such gross sales, and each itemized statement shall be certified by a duly authorized officer of MusclePharm. Such statements shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\" and furnished to Lender whether or not any Licensed Products were sold during the Royalty Period.",
                "changed_text": "(v) During the Term and during the sell-off period, MusclePharm shall make royalty payments in U.S. dollars for the respective quarters ending on the last day of September, December, March and June (each, a \"Royalty Period\") within ninety (90) days from the end of each quarterly period. Each such royalty payment shall include an itemized statement showing the nature and source of such royalties, including (i) the number of units of Licensed Products sold (by country and customer); (ii) the total number of units returned for which credit was given and the total dollar amount of such credits, and (iii) the total gross sales and the total royalties due with respect to such gross sales, and each itemized statement shall be certified by a duly authorized officer of MusclePharm. Such statements shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\" and furnished to Lender whether or not any Licensed Products were sold during the Royalty Period.",
                "explanation": "California law requires royalty payments to be made within a reasonable timeframe, typically interpreted as being shorter than 90 days, especially given the nature of the licensed product sales. Extending the payment period to 90 days is an unreasonable delay which could be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing under California contract law.",

                "explanation": "Under California law, a waiver of rights must be knowing and voluntary. By stating acceptance acts as a waiver, it may not be knowing and intentional. This is an attempt to restrict Arnold's ability to dispute royalty statements, conflicting with CA law that protects individuals from unknowingly waiving their legal rights.",

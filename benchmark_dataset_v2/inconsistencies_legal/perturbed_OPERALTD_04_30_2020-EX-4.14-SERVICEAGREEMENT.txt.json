According to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 in India, if the buyer and seller have a written agreement, the payment period cannot exceed 45 days from the date of acceptance or the date of deemed acceptance. Therefore, setting the payment timeline to 180 days is a legal contradiction.",

However, the modified text extends the payment period to 90 days. As the payment period cannot exceed 45 days under the MSMED Act, this modification creates a legal contradiction, potentially rendering the payment term unenforceable.",

Indian law, particularly concerning trade secrets, requires reasonable measures to protect confidentiality. A one-year period might be deemed insufficient to provide adequate protection, contradicting the implied duty to safeguard such information for a reasonable duration based on the information's value and lifespan.",

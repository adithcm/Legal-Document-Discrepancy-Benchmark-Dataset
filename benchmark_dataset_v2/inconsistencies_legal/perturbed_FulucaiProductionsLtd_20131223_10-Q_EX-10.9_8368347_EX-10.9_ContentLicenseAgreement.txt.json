                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Producer shall have thirty (30) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "changed_text": "The Producer shall have ten (10) days from the payment date to dispute the amount of any revenue share payout or any such claim or dispute is hereby waived by the Producer.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the time the Producer has to dispute revenue share payouts. This creates an inconsistency as such a short period may be deemed unconscionable or against good faith dealing, especially if the information needed to assess the payout is complex or not immediately available. This timeframe potentially contradicts general principles of contract law that require reasonable opportunity to review and challenge financial statements.",

Notices shall be made by personal delivery, overnight courier, first class registered mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested), facsimile or e-mail. A Notice shall be deemed served and received on the date executed on a receipt of acceptance or if by personal delivery, upon physical delivery of the same.",
                "changed_text": "All notices, statements or requests for approvals (\"Notices\") must be sent via carrier pigeon only to be considered valid. A Notice shall be deemed served and received only if the carrier pigeon successfully delivers the message.",
                "explanation": "This modification specifies that notices can only be given via carrier pigeon, and only considered received if the pigeon delivers the message. This is clearly an unreasonable and unreliable method of notice, contradicting the reasonable notice requirements inherent in contract law and procedural rules for legal disputes. Modern contract law requires commercially reasonable methods for delivering legally binding notices. This change introduces potential legal challenges regarding the validity of notices given under the contract.",

                "explanation": "This replaces the standard attorney's fees clause with a requirement for the losing party to publicly denounce their claims on social media. This is an unusual and potentially unenforceable remedy that could be seen as a form of compelled speech or public shaming, potentially violating the losing party's rights. It contradicts the typical legal remedies available and could violate free speech protections if used improperly.",

                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days after the initial shipment of the products covered by this Agreement, and promptly on the 15th of each calendar month thereafter, Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. complete and accurate statements certified to be accurate by Diplomat showing the number, description and gross sales price, itemized deductions from gross sales price, and net sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat during the preceding calendar month, together with any returns made during the preceding calendar month. Such statements shall be furnished to KI, Inc. whether or not any of the products have been sold during the preceding calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "Within ninety (90) days after the initial shipment of the products covered by this Agreement, and promptly on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter, Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. statements. These statements will show the number, description, and gross sales price of the products sold, without itemized deductions. No statements are needed if no products have been sold.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires monthly statements with detailed sales information. The modified text changes the reporting period to quarterly, eliminates the requirement for itemized deductions (which is important for calculating royalties accurately), and states statements are unnecessary if no products have been sold. This can be problematic as KI, Inc. needs to stay up-to-date with the royalty payments and the number of returns.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring good faith and fair dealing, as well as the implied duty to cooperate in the performance of the contract. Also contradicts standard accounting practices.",

                "original_text": "Royalties in excess of the minimum royalty shall be due on the 25th day of the month following the calendar month in which they are earned, and payment shall accompany the statements furnished pursuant to subparagraph (c), above. The receipt or acceptance by KI, Inc. of any of the statements furnished pursuant to this Agreement, or of any royalties paid hereunder, or the cashing of any royalty checks paid hereunder, shall not preclude KI, Inc. from questioning the correctness of such statements or payments, provided all such questions are raised with Diplomat within two years of the date of KI Inc's receipt of the statement or payment in question. In the event any inconsistencies or mistakes are discovered in such statements or payments, they shall immediately be rectified and the appropriate payments made by Diplomat.",
                "changed_text": "Royalties exceeding the minimum will be due at Diplomat's discretion. Acceptance by KI, Inc. of statements or royalties means KI, Inc. cannot later question their accuracy. Any discovered inconsistencies will be addressed when Diplomat deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a clear deadline for royalty payments and allows KI, Inc. two years to dispute statements. The modified clause makes royalty payments discretionary, prevents KI, Inc. from ever questioning statements, and removes the obligation for immediate rectification of errors. This is problematic as it greatly weakens KI, Inc.'s ability to enforce royalty payments and audit sales figures, and some states have statutory time limits for breach of contract claims.",

                "original_text": "Diplomat agrees that it will obtain, at its own expense, product liability insurance from a recognized insurance company which is qualified to do business in the State of California providing adequate protection (at least in the amount of $         ) for KI, Inc., KI and Diplomat against any claims, suits, loss or damage arising out of any alleged defects in the products. As proof of such insurance, a fully paid certificate of insurance naming KI, Inc. and KI as an insured party will be submitted to KI, Inc. by Diplomat for KI, Inc.'s prior approval before any product is distributed or sold, and at the latest within thirty (30) days after the date first written above. Any proposed change in certificates of insurance shall be submitted to KI, Inc. for its prior approval. KI, Inc. shall be entitled to a copy of the then prevailing certificate of insurance, which shall be furnished KI, Inc. by Diplomat. As used in the first 2 sentences of this paragraph 6, \"KI, Inc.\" shall also include the officers, directors, agents, and employees of the KI, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.",
                "changed_text": "Diplomat will attempt to get product liability insurance if reasonably possible. Proof of insurance is not required unless specifically requested by KI, Inc. KI, Inc. is not required to be named as an insured party.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates product liability insurance and requires KI, Inc. to be named as an insured party, with proof submitted before product distribution. The modified version makes obtaining insurance optional, eliminates the requirement for KI, Inc. to be named as an insured, and removes the requirement for upfront proof. This increases the risk of liability for KI, Inc. in the event of product defects. Some states have implied warranty laws that could be affected by inadequate insurance coverage.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring reasonable care and the fulfillment of implied warranties, as well as the duty to mitigate damages. Also, potential liability concerns under product liability law.",

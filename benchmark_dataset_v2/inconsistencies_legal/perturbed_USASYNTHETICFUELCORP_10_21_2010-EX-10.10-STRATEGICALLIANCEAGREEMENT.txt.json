Upon the written request of a Party, the other Party shall certify the destruction of such material by written notice to the requesting Party.\n\n(vi) This covenant shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of three (3) years thereafter.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows five days for the return or destruction of confidential information upon request or termination of the agreement and maintains confidentiality for three years after termination. The modified text reduces the return/destruction period to one day and the confidentiality period to one year. This could be considered unreasonably short, especially concerning trade secrets or sensitive business data, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws that require reasonable measures to protect confidential information for an adequate period.",
                "contradicted_law": "State trade secret laws (e.g., the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as adopted by many US states) require reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, and a one-year confidentiality period may be deemed insufficient depending on the nature of the information.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a 30-day cure period for defaults and a 60-day period to dismiss involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. The modified text shortens these periods to 10 and 30 days respectively. A 10-day cure period for significant contractual breaches might be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex issues. Also reducing the time to dismiss an involuntary bankruptcy can also contradict standard business norms.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a five-day waiting period for notices sent by first-class mail to be considered duly given. This is a standard business practice. The modified text extends this period to twenty days, which could be viewed as unreasonably long, particularly if there are time-sensitive obligations such as a breach of contract or legal disputes.

                "original_text": "(v) Any Confidential Information, including all copies of same (including that portion of the Confidential Information that consists of analyses, forecasts, studies or other documents prepared by a Party or its advisors, agents, contractors or lenders), shall be returned to the other Party, or at such Party's option destroyed, within five (5) days of (A) a request by a Party at anytime; or (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon the written request of a Party, the other Party shall certify the destruction of such material by written notice to the requesting Party.",

Upon the written request of a Party, the other Party is not required to certify the destruction of such material.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires return or destruction of confidential information within five days. The modified text changes this to one day, which is potentially insufficient time and could be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the scope of confidential information as defined in the contract, creating legal challenges regarding compliance. Additionally, the removal of the requirement to certify destruction weakens compliance verification, potentially conflicting with best practices for data security.",
                "contradicted_law": "Data protection and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) require reasonable timeframes for data handling and destruction. Some regulations emphasize documented proof of data destruction.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the confidentiality agreement is valid for three years after the termination. The new text reduces the confidentiality timeframe to one year, which might not provide sufficient time for the protection of trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially if the information has a longer shelf life or competitive relevance. This could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, especially for complex technological information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade secret law requires reasonable measures to maintain secrecy. A one-year confidentiality period might be deemed insufficient for protecting certain types of trade secrets, conflicting with the reasonable measures standard.",

                "changed_text": "(c) Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given only when sent by carrier pigeon; if sent by first-class mail, twenty (20) days after being mailed.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines methods for delivering notices with reasonable timeframes. The revised text mandates carrier pigeon, an impractical method, and a twenty-day timeframe for first-class mail which is also an unreasonable time period, potentially causing delays in important communications and legal disputes, and possibly violating requirements for timely notification of key contractual matters.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requires reasonable methods for providing notice. Relying solely on carrier pigeon is not commercially reasonable in most jurisdictions, and a delay of 20 days by mail for notices violates standards of reasonable notice.",

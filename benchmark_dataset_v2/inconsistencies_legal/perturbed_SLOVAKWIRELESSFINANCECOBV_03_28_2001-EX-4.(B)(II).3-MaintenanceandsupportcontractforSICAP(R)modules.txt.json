                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All payments due under this Maintenance and Support contract shall be due       and payable 30 days after the invoice date, with the first invoice to be       issued on the date this Maintenance and Support contract comes into full       force and effect.",
                "changed_text": "All payments due under this Maintenance and Support contract shall be due and payable 60 days after the invoice date, with the first invoice to be issued 90 days after the Maintenance and Support contract comes into full force and effect.",
                "explanation": "Slovakian law dictates payment terms must be fair and not unduly disadvantage the weaker party. Extending the payment term to 60 and 90 days respectively from the standard 30 days after the invoice date could be deemed an unreasonably long delay, particularly for smaller businesses, potentially violating fair trading practices and creating financial strain, thereby contradicting legislative intent concerning equitable business practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Slovakian Civil Code and Commercial Code provisions related to fair trading practices and reasonable payment terms.",

                "original_text": "After this period, Sicap Ltd reserves the right to adjust the prices       annually. The offer must be submitted three (3) months in advance and       EuroTel may decide within one (1) month to prolong or terminate this       maintenance and support contract. If EuroTel doesn't react in writing, the       new offer shall be considered as accepted.",
                "changed_text": "After this period, Sicap Ltd reserves the right to adjust the prices annually. The offer must be submitted one (1) month in advance and EuroTel may decide within fifteen (15) days to prolong or terminate this maintenance and support contract. If EuroTel doesn't react, the new offer shall be considered as accepted.",
                "explanation": "Decreasing the notification period for price adjustments to one month and the decision period for EuroTel to fifteen days is likely a legal contradiction, because per Slovakian law, parties must be afforded reasonable time to assess and respond to contract changes. Such a short timeframe is considered unfair to the client to make a decision regarding a contract change, especially considering the size of the company.",

                "original_text": "After the initial period of two years, the maintenance and support       contract shall be automatically renewed for a period of one year on each       renewal date, unless one of the parties terminates the maintenance and       support contract through written notification to the other party in the       form of a registered letter with proof of receipt, at least six (6) weeks       prior to the renewal date. There shall be no reimbursement of any paid       fee.",
                "changed_text": "After the initial period of two years, the maintenance and support contract shall be automatically renewed for a period of one year on each renewal date, unless one of the parties terminates the maintenance and support contract through verbal notification to the other party at least two (2) weeks prior to the renewal date. There shall be no reimbursement of any paid fee.",
                "explanation": "Changing the termination notification to verbal and reducing the notice period to two weeks is a legal contradiction. Slovakian law mandates written notification for significant contract changes/termination to ensure clear record-keeping and proof of communication. Additionally, such a short notification period is not enough time to find a replacement and is likely to violate contract standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Slovakian Civil Code requirements for written notification and reasonable notice periods for contract termination.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month for sales during the previous month.",
                "changed_text": "All undisputed Royalty payments shall be made in U.S. dollars in cash or to the order of Individual and shall be due and payable within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar quarter for sales during the previous quarter.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment terms to 'ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar quarter' significantly delays payment. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific nature of the royalties, this could violate wage payment laws or breach implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, as many jurisdictions have laws requiring more frequent payment of earned compensation. Illinois, the governing law, may view such a delay as unreasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act or breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "Notices to the parties shall be sent via overnight mail or U.S. Certified Mail or overnight express or priority mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address upon written notice to the other party. Written notices for approvals under this agreement may be via email.",
                "changed_text": "Notices to the parties shall be sent via standard U.S. mail to the addresses listed in the Agreement. Either party may change its address only by updating their information with the Secretary of State. Written notices for approvals under this agreement are not required.",
                "explanation": "Requiring address changes to be updated only with the Secretary of State places an unreasonable burden on the parties, conflicts with standard notification practices, and could lead to missed legal deadlines. Removing the requirement for written approval notices could also be problematic if certain approvals require formal documentation under Illinois law or general contract principles.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with reasonable notice requirements under Illinois contract law and principles of fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "Changing the non-compete clause to extend for the rest of the Individual's life and encompassing 'any product whatsoever' is overly broad and likely unenforceable under Illinois law. Illinois courts scrutinize non-compete agreements, and such a broad restriction is unlikely to be considered reasonable in scope or duration, violating public policy concerns about restricting trade.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates Illinois public policy against unreasonable restraints of trade and potentially conflicts with the Illinois Freedom to Work Act.",

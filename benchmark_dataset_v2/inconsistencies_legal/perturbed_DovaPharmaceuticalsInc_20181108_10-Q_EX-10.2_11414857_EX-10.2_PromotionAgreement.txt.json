Through the JSC, the Parties shall agree on a mutually acceptable form of Detail Report.",
                "changed_text": "Valeant shall provide Dova with a written report (each a \"Detail Report\"), setting out (i) the quarterly average number of Sales Representatives during such Calendar Quarter (calculated by taking the sum of the number of Sales Representatives employed by Valeant (or its affiliates) that have incentive compensation packages that comply with the terms of Section 4.1.3 on each Business Day of the Calendar Quarter divided by the number of Business Days in such Calendar Quarter) (the \"Quarterly Average Sales Force Size\"), and (ii) the aggregate actual number of Details for the Product made by its Sales Representatives during such Calendar Quarter, and the number of Details broken down by the name of the Target Professionals,. The detail report will be provided when Valeant deems appropriate.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Valeant to give Dova a written report after the end of each Calendar quarter. The updated text gives Valeant the power to determine when that written report is provided, potentially conflicting with the original agreement. The change removes the previously defined timeline, conflicting with standard contract law requiring deadlines to be clearly defined.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that both parties finalize the responsibilities to the patient no later than a specific date. However, the updated version states that both parties shall 'attempt' to do so when 'deemed necessary'. If a patient is harmed and the parties never deemed it 'necessary', then both parties could be held liable. The new text also creates ambiguity regarding the finalization of responsibilities, potentially leading to disputes and non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "The original text ensures that Dova operates within applicable laws regarding patient assistance programs, as these programs can reduce a patient's out-of-pocket costs for medications. There are strict regulations in place regarding how these programs operate, and how they cannot be utilized. The new text allows Dova to operate these programs as they see fit and without liability, opening the door to operate the programs outside of the law.",

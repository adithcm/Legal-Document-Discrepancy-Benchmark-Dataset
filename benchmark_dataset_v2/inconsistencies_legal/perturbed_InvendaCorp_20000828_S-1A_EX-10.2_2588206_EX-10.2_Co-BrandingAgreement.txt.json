                "explanation": "The original text provides a clear deadline of three business days for removing competitor advertising. The modified text extends the deadline to ten business days and introduces uncertainty by making the removal discretionary. This contradicts typical advertising agreements where timely removal of competitor ads is crucial and often legally mandated for fair competition.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (Unfair Competition Law) - could be construed as unfair competition if Excite@Home unreasonably delays removing competitor ads, potentially harming Application Provider's market position.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within ten days of the agreement's effective date. Changing this to forty-five days introduces a delay in payment, which could be a breach of contract if it violates standard payment terms or creates financial hardship for Excite@Home. The initial payment is typically for upfront costs.",

                "original_text": "By no later than 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Remarketing Settlement Date, provided that there has been a Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agents shall advise, by telephone, the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee that the Remarketing was a Successful Remarketing and of the Reset Rates determined in the Remarketing and the aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Securities sold in the Remarketing.",
                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agents shall advise the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee that the Remarketing was a Successful Remarketing and of the Reset Rates determined in the Remarketing and the aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Securities sold in the Remarketing at the Remarketing Agents' earliest convenience.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific deadline of '4:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Remarketing Settlement Date,' the modified text introduces ambiguity and conflicts with regulations that require clear and timely notification in financial transactions. This change creates non-compliance by removing a mandated timeline.",

                "original_text": "During a period of five years from the effective date of the Registration Statement, to furnish to the Remarketing Agents copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders of the Company, and to furnish to the Remarketing Agents as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Securities or any class of securities of the Company is listed (such financial statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission), provided that reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission, and publicly available on EDGAR, or furnished on the Company's website, shall be deemed to have been furnished to the Remarketing Agents under this Section 3(h);",
                "changed_text": "The Company is not obligated to furnish reports or other communications to the Remarketing Agents.",
                "explanation": "By stating that 'The Company is not obligated to furnish reports or other communications to the Remarketing Agents,' this modification directly contradicts the initial requirement for the company to provide regular reports to the Remarketing Agents, as specified in the original text. This change implies that the Remarketing Agents will have no access to information about the company's financial health or compliance with regulations. By doing this, it removes the liability of the company to provide reports which can be an issue, as reporting misconduct in financials is important to comply with regulations.",

                "original_text": "A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a letter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures.",
                "changed_text": "A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, with no written notice. No successor Remarketing Agent needs to be appointed.",
                "explanation": "The original text states there needs to be a 5 day notice for the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in order for a resignation to happen. This change completely removes the need for a written notice which can violate labor laws. Also, there is a part of the original text that states that there needs to be a Successor Remarketing Agent appointed, this is also being removed which goes against the original contract of having one appointed.",

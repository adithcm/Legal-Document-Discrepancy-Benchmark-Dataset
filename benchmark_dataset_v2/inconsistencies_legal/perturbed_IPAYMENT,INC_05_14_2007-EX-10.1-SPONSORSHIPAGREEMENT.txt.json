                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "ISO shall cease its use of any Application Materials that become unacceptable to SERVICERS within ninety (90) days of receipt of written notice from SERVICERS or such shorter period of time as may be required to comply with the Rules or to prevent a loss to SERVICERS.",
                "changed_text": "ISO shall cease its use of any Application Materials that become unacceptable to SERVICERS within thirty (300) days of receipt of written notice from SERVICERS. In some cases, SERVICERS may take up to a year to have any changes implemented for their business plan.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the deadline for ISO to stop using unacceptable application materials, extending it to 300 days. In some cases, it might take up to a year to have the business plan implemented, which is an undefined and unspecified deadline. This creates non-compliance, as the original timeline already allowed for shorter periods if required by the Rules or to prevent loss, reflecting a legally sound approach to adapt quickly, but now it is more than tripled.",

                "changed_text": "All Promotional Materials must be sent to SERVICERS for their records, but no approval is needed before use by ISO.",
                "explanation": "This removes the requirement for SERVICERS to approve Promotional Materials before ISO uses them, as well as removes any time constraint for SERVICERS to provide any feedback. This is a violation of regulatory standards where materials used by an ISO must be approved before use, not just sent for records, to protect consumers.",

                "changed_text": "SERVICERS will hold the Termination Reserve Account balance indefinitely, without any obligation to reduce it, regardless of any reductions in ISO's potential liability, as the Program Transfer and Deconversion progress.",
                "explanation": "This modification gives SERVICERS the right to hold the Termination Reserve Account indefinitely, even if there are reduced risks. The current modification leads to non-compliance, as it is in conflict with regulatory standards and general contract law.",

                "original_text": "15. PAYMENT TERMS\nThe Distributor agrees to abide by Lucid's standard payment terms, which are as follows; One Hundred (100) per cent of order value by sixty ( 90 )  day irrevocable letter of credit when order is placed on Lucid.",
                "changed_text": "15. PAYMENT TERMS\nThe Distributor agrees to abide by Lucid's standard payment terms, which are as follows; One Hundred (100) per cent of order value within 15 days by irrevocable letter of credit when order is placed on Lucid.",
                "explanation": "This change mandates payment within 15 days. This could be considered an unreasonably short timeframe under general commercial law principles of fairness and industry standards for international distributors, potentially conflicting with good faith dealings and fair business practices. This is especially problematic considering the size of the order.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of good faith and fair dealing under New York contract law, potentially violating UCC standards on reasonable payment terms.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 30 days may be deemed unreasonably short depending on the specific circumstances, investment made, and applicable regulations regarding distributor protection, creating a potential conflict with commercial reasonableness standards.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of 'reasonable notice' requirements under common law, particularly if substantial investments were made by the distributor. Some jurisdictions also have franchise or distributor protection laws that mandate longer notice periods.",

Notice shall be effective (a) upon receipt if personally delivered (b) upon confirmation of transmission if sent via  facsimile and (c) two (2) business days after deposit with the courier or an official depository of the US Post Office, if sent via recognised  overnight courier of via Certified Mail, as the case may be.",

Any change of addresser fax number must be designated in writing and served in accordance with this Section. Notice shall be effective only upon receipt, regardless of the method of delivery.",
                "explanation": "By stating that the Notice is only effective upon receipt, regardless of delivery method, it creates uncertainty and contradicts common practice in contract law. Often, sending a notice via certified mail or overnight courier creates a presumption of receipt after a reasonable amount of time. Making receipt the *only* determining factor places an undue burden on the sender and can lead to disputes if the recipient denies receipt.",
                "contradicted_law": "Conflicts with established legal principles regarding 'constructive notice' and the presumption of receipt when using reliable delivery methods like certified mail, undermining legal standards for effective notice in contract law.",

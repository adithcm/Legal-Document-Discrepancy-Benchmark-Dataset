                "original_text": "Upon the execution of this Agreement, Go Call shall forward to PageMaster Corporation a deposit in the sum of $100,000.00 to secure the availability of 100,000 pagers to all Purchase Customers who prepay their annual airtime for this promotion. The deposit is non-refundable except as follows:\n\n        a.     PageMaster Corporation shall refund to Go Call, $1.00 per pager                on all pagers delivered to Purchase Customers pursuant to this                promotion (net return) up to the maximum refund of $100,000.00.\n\n        b.     On the last day of each month, the refund of Go Call's portion of                the deposit shall be calculated by PageMaster Corporation for the           &bbsp;    prior month and will be forwarded to Go Call by check, along with                an extended accounting of all pagers and customers until                September 1, 2000, unless otherwise instructed by Go Call. Go                Call, upon ten (10) days written notice, shall have the right to                examine the books and records of PageMaster Corporation to verify                the sales resulting from this promotion. Such examination shall                be made at the regular place of business of PageMaster                Corporation where such books and records are maintained during                normal business hours and shall be conducted at Go Call's expense                by a certified public accountant or other Go Call executive so                designated by Go Call.",
                "changed_text": "Upon the execution of this Agreement, Go Call shall forward to PageMaster Corporation a deposit in the sum of $100,000.00 to secure the availability of 100,000 pagers to all Purchase Customers who prepay their annual airtime for this promotion. The deposit is non-refundable, without exception.\n\n        a.     PageMaster Corporation is under no obligation to refund any portion of the deposit to Go Call.\n\n        b.     PageMaster Corporation will provide an accounting of pagers and customers at its sole discretion. Go Call, upon two (2) days written notice, shall have the right to examine the books and records of PageMaster Corporation to verify the sales resulting from this promotion. Such examination shall be made at a location of PageMaster Corporation's choosing, whether or not it is the regular place of business. The time of the examination will be set by PageMaster Corporation. The examination shall be conducted at Go Call's expense by a non-certified individual designated by PageMaster Corporation.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a refund mechanism for the deposit, whereas the modified text makes the deposit entirely non-refundable, potentially violating California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing which requires parties to act reasonably and honestly. Limiting the time to examine books to 2 days violates California regulations regarding reasonable time to prepare for such actions.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to 24 hours after sending and requiring only 10 days' notice to change the address creates an unreasonable constraint, potentially violating California's requirements for adequate and reasonable notice in contractual agreements, depending on the specific context and importance of the notice.",

Each party agrees (1) to review, examine, inspect, obtain or utilize the information only for the purpose of this promotion, (2) to otherwise hold such Information strictly confidential, (3) to prevent the disclosure of such Information to nonessential third parties without a \"need to know\", and (4) to insure that each party's employees, agents and representatives and those of any integral third party understand and are bound by the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement. Each party shall indemnify the other party with respect to any loss or damage arising from the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Information by their respective employees, agents and representatives, or by those of any third\n\n\n\nparty to whom such Information was disclosed. The agreements contained in this Paragraph shall survive the expiration, or termination of this Agreement. The panics hereby agree that subsequent to the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party consents to the other party's use of its name only in connection with advertising to their respective trade or industry.",

Each party agrees to hold such Information confidential, provided such information is clearly marked as confidential at the time of disclosure. The agreements contained in this Paragraph shall not survive the expiration, or termination of this Agreement. The parties hereby agree that subsequent to the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party is free to use the other party's name without restriction.",
                "explanation": "The modified clause significantly weakens confidentiality protections. Requiring information to be \"clearly marked as confidential at the time of disclosure\" adds a condition that can easily be missed, leading to unintentional disclosure of confidential information, violating the reasonable measures to protect trade secrets. The clause stating agreements shall not survive the expiration of the agreement directly conflicts with typical survival clauses for confidential information. Allowing unrestricted use of the other party's name removes any control over brand reputation, potentially violating California's law of publicity or unfair competition laws.",

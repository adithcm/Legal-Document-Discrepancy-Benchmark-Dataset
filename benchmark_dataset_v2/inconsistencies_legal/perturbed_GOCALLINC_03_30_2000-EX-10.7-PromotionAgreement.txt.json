                "original_text": "b. On the last day of each month, the refund of Go Call's portion of the deposit shall be calculated by PageMaster Corporation for the &bbsp; prior month and will be forwarded to Go Call by check, along with an extended accounting of all pagers and customers until September 1, 2000, unless otherwise instructed by Go Call. Go Call, upon ten (10) days written notice, shall have the right to examine the books and records of PageMaster Corporation to verify the sales resulting from this promotion. Such examination shall be made at the regular place of business of PageMaster Corporation where such books and records are maintained during normal business hours and shall be conducted at Go Call's expense by a certified public accountant or other Go Call executive so designated by Go Call.",
                "changed_text": "b. The refund of Go Call's portion of the deposit shall be calculated by PageMaster Corporation at its sole discretion and will be forwarded to Go Call when deemed appropriate. Go Call, upon two (2) days written notice, shall have the right to examine the books and records of PageMaster Corporation to verify the sales resulting from this promotion. Such examination shall be made at a location of PageMaster Corporation's choosing and shall be conducted at Go Call's expense, with PageMaster Corporation personnel present.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a monthly refund schedule. The modified text removes the fixed schedule, giving PageMaster Corporation discretion over the timing of refunds, violating general contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, reducing the notice period for examining books to two days is unreasonably short, hindering Go Call's ability to prepare adequately, and changes the audit procedure to be controlled by PageMaster, again conflicting with typical audit standards. The contract now has a high chance of being voided as a result.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, which is implied in every contract under California law. Unreasonable restrictions on audit rights.",

                "original_text": "Such notice or demand shall be deemed to have been given or made when actually received or seventy-two (72) hours after being sent, whichever occurs first. The address for notice set out above may be changed at any time by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice in the manner above.",
                "changed_text": "Such notice or demand shall be deemed to have been given or made when sent. The address for notice set out above may be changed at any time by giving five (5) days prior written notice in the manner above.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that notice is deemed given 72 hours after sending if not actually received earlier, which is fairly standard. The modified text states notice is deemed given when sent, regardless of whether it's received. This contradicts the legal principle of 'reasonable notice' and the 'mailbox rule', as it doesn't allow adequate time for receipt and response. Moreover, reducing the notice period for address changes to 5 days is insufficient for ensuring proper communication and violates standard business practices requiring longer notification periods for critical changes.",

Confidentiality --------------- The parties acknowledge that preparation for and execution of the promotion necessitates the exchange of confidential and proprietary information relating and belonging to the parties to this Agreement, as well as to other third parties integral to the promotion, including, without limitation, the pager manufacturer and the airtime supplier (herein \"Information\"). Each party agrees (1) to review, examine, inspect, obtain or utilize the information only for the purpose of this promotion, (2) to otherwise hold such Information strictly confidential, (3) to prevent the disclosure of such Information to nonessential third parties without a \"need to know\", and (4) to insure that each party's employees, agents and representatives and those of any integral third party understand and are bound by the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement. Each party shall indemnify the other party with respect to any loss or damage arising from the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Information by their respective employees, agents and representatives, or by those of any third party to whom such Information was disclosed. The agreements contained in this Paragraph shall survive the expiration, or termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text creates a more robust Confidentiality clause by specifying that 'each party agrees to prevent the disclosure of such Information to nonessential third parties without a need to know' and (1) to review, examine, inspect, obtain or utilize the information only for the purpose of this promotion'. By removing sections of the initial statement, as well as changing the final sentece to 'The agreements contained in this Paragraph shall terminate upon the expiration, or termination of this Agreement.' This would violate the confidentiality expectations, and no long protect it once the agreement expires.",

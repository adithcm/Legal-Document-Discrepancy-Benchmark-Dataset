                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree that joint filings are at each individual's discretion and further amendments thereto require only verbal consent, with no need for formal documentation or inclusion as an exhibit.",
                "explanation": "This modification contradicts the SEC's requirements for documented joint filing agreements, as it removes the need for written consent and exhibit inclusion, violating the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related regulations.",

                "explanation": "This modification contradicts standard contract law practices that deem multiple original signed counterparts to be equally valid. By stating 'requires only one original signature', the amendment can create enforceability issues if multiple parties are signing from different locations, contradicting legal norms for contract execution and evidence.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity and legal risk by invalidating the agreement's effective date. Securities regulations often mandate that filings occur within specific timeframes tied to triggering events. The changed wording allows the parties to backdate or postdate the agreement freely, potentially causing violations of securities laws requiring accurate and timely disclosures.",

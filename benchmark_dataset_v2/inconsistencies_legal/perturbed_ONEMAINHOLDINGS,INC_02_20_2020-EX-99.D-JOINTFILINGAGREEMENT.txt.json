                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing. This Agreement must be executed within 1 year, no extensions allowed, and will be considered void if not completed within that timeframe.",
                "explanation": "The modification adds a strict one-year deadline for executing the agreement. Securities laws and regulations do not typically impose such a rigid timeframe and allow for extensions or modifications as needed. A one-year limitation, without exceptions, could conflict with regulatory requirements for timely and accurate filings, potentially leading to non-compliance and penalties.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement must be physically executed, and digital signatures are explicitly prohibited, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change explicitly prohibits the use of digital signatures. The E-SIGN Act and similar state laws generally grant legal validity to digital signatures. Restricting the agreement to physical signatures contradicts these laws, potentially invalidating the agreement if parties rely on digital signatures.",

                "explanation": "Making the agreement retroactively effective to January 1, 2010, is problematic because it attempts to impose legal obligations and consequences for actions taken prior to the agreement's actual execution date (February 20, 2020). This could conflict with principles of contract law, especially if the parties' conduct between January 1, 2010, and February 20, 2020, was not in accordance with the terms now being retroactively applied. It is possible that such a clause could be deemed unenforceable or lead to legal challenges regarding its validity.",

All replacement personnel shall be required to participate in Support Training as described in Section 3.3 below. Converge Support Personnel will be the \"single point of contact\" for the Maintenance and Support Services provided by VNE under this Section 2.",

Converge may change the Converge Support Personnel on written notice to VNE; provided, however, that Converge may change the Converge Support Personnel as frequently as they want, but not exceed more than once every 5 days. All replacement personnel shall be required to participate in Support Training as described in Section 3.3 below. Converge Support Personnel will be the \"single point of contact\" for the Maintenance and Support Services provided by VNE under this Section 2.",

This has been modified to 2 days, contradicting state laws like California, which require at least 30 days for harassment claims. The original text states Converge shall use reasonable efforts not to change the Converge Support Personnel more frequently than once every 30 days. This has been modified to 5 days which increases the frequency of changes.",

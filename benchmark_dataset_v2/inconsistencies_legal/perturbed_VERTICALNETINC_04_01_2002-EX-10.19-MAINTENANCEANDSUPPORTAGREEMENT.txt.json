                "original_text": "In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days following the date of performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 30 days to the extent technically feasible).",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge reports such breach to VNE in writing within 10 days following the date of performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 90 days to the extent technically feasible).",
                "explanation": "The original text allowed for 90 days to report a warranty breach, which is generally reasonable. The modified text reduces this to 10 days, which may be considered unreasonably short under Pennsylvania law (stated in Section 10.6) for complex service agreements, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Furthermore, the time to correct the warranty has been increased to 90 days which might be too long for certain services.",

Thereafter, Converge shall pay each such Monthly Installment to VNE no later than the first day of each month during the Initial Term (November 2001 and through March 2003).

All such Monthly Installments are refundable.",
                "explanation": "By making the \"Monthly Installments\" refundable, it directly contradicts the original agreement which stated that they were \"non-refundable\". This potentially creates a contradiction with general contract principles if the refundability isn't clearly defined, making it unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "The original text allowed for 10 business days to provide written notice of termination after an event of default. The modified text shortens this to 1 business day. This is an unreasonably short time, especially for complex business agreements. In Pennsylvania, a reasonable notice period must be given, and one day may be deemed insufficient and may be seen as a breach of good faith and fair dealing. This modification introduces a legal contradiction by not providing adequate time to assess the situation and provide notice of termination.",

The total price for both of the Licensed Programs together is $[*] per month per Product (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall begin on the date the Product is shipped to a customer and shall be paid by Power2Ship to WLI by the 7th of each month for the prior month (prorated if the Unit was shipped during the prior month) and shall continue for as long as the Product is active on any wireless network. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Power2Ship is obligated to pay the License Fee to WLI for a minimum of 36 months.",

                "explanation": "Extended the minimum License Fee payment duration to 72 months. This contradicts standard business practices and could raise concerns under state-specific franchise laws or unfair business practice regulations, as it imposes a potentially unreasonable financial burden on the distributor without a clear corresponding benefit. The extended duration might be viewed as an unconscionable term.",

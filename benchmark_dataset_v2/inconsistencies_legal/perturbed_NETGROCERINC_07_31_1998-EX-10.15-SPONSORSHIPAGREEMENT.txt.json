                "original_text": "All payments that would be due pursuant to Sections 5(b) - (d) up to the date of any termination or expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within thirty (30) days following such termination or expiration.",
                "changed_text": "All payments that would be due pursuant to Sections 5(b) - (d) up to the date of any termination or expiration of this Agreement will be payable in full within ninety (90) days following such termination or expiration.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline after termination to 90 days contradicts California Labor Code Section 201 and 202, which require final wages to be paid immediately upon termination or within 72 hours if the employee quits without notice. Making it 90 days violates California and US federal labor laws.",

                "original_text": "NetGrocer may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Excite cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Excite reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Excite's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant will be paid by NetGrocer unless the audit finds a discrepancy of more than five percent (5%) with respect to the item being audited, in which case Excite shall be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "changed_text": "NetGrocer may, upon no less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Excite cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of Excite reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during Excite's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant will be paid by NetGrocer unless the audit finds a discrepancy of more than ten percent (10%) with respect to the item being audited, in which case Excite shall be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for auditing financial records to 10 days and increasing the discrepancy threshold to 10% from 5% may be considered unreasonable and could violate standard business practice and potentially conflict with fiduciary duty principles implied in commercial contracts. Although there isn't a specific law mandating a minimum notice period for audits, such a short notice period and high discrepancy threshold could be deemed unfair and unconscionable under general contract law principles, especially if it hinders NetGrocer's ability to verify payment accuracy. In California, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires parties to act reasonably, and these changes could be seen as a breach of that covenant.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate this Agreement, in the event that the other party materially breaches its obligations or guarantees hereunder and such breach remains uncured for fifteen (15) days following written notice to the breaching party of the breach.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 15 days could be considered unreasonably short and may conflict with general principles of contract law, potentially rendering the termination clause unenforceable. While there's no explicit law mandating a specific cure period, courts often evaluate the reasonableness of such periods based on the complexity of the breach and the effort required to remedy it. Fifteen days might be insufficient for rectifying significant breaches, particularly in commercial agreements of this nature. This could be challenged under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

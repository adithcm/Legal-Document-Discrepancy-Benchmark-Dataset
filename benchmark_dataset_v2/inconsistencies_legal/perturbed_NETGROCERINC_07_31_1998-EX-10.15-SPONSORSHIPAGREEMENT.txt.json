                "original_text": "g) If Excite misses any quarterly guaranteed Click-through amount, Excite will make good the difference within [*] days following the end of such quarter. If Excite does not make good the difference within [*] days, NetGrocer may suspend (but not eliminate) its payments of the sponsorship and advertising fees described in Section 5(b) and 5(c) until the make-good is delivered, at which time NetGrocer will resume its payments of the sponsorship and advertising fees.",
                "changed_text": "g) If Excite misses any quarterly guaranteed Click-through amount, Excite will make good the difference within [*] days following the end of such quarter. If Excite does not make good the difference within [*] days, NetGrocer may immediately terminate the agreement without notice and retain all payments made to date.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a penalty for Excite's failure to meet the click-through guarantee that may be deemed unreasonably punitive and could violate California's laws regarding contract penalties. California law requires that penalties for breach of contract bear a reasonable relationship to the actual damages suffered.",

                "original_text": "c) Notice. Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by personal delivery, express courier, confirmed facsimile, confirmed email or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and will be deemed given upon personal delivery, one (1) day after deposit with express courier, upon confirmation of receipt of facsimile or email or five (5) days after deposit in the mail.",
                "changed_text": "c) Notice. Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by personal delivery ONLY, and will be deemed given ONLY upon personal delivery.",
                "explanation": "This modification restricts acceptable notice methods to only personal delivery. This is problematic and potentially violates legal standards regarding sufficient notice, especially in business disputes. It is important to allow for methods with proof of service like certified mail, especially when dealing with entities in different states. This limited form of notice may not be legally sufficient, particularly in cases requiring proof of timely notification, which could lead to due process concerns.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding reasonable and sufficient notice; potential due process concerns.",

                "original_text": "b) Either party may terminate this Agreement, in the event that the other party materially breaches its obligations or guarantees hereunder and such breach remains uncured for sixty (60) days following written notice to the breaching party of the breach.",
                "changed_text": "b) Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon discovering a breach, regardless of materiality or opportunity to cure.",
                "explanation": "This clause originally allows for a 60-day cure period after notice of a material breach. By removing the cure period and materiality requirement, the modified clause allows for immediate termination for any breach, no matter how minor. This could be deemed an unreasonable contract term and may violate California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act fairly and not do anything that would deprive the other party of the benefits of the agreement. Immediate termination for trivial breaches could also be seen as a form of penalty not reasonably related to the damages suffered, violating California law.",

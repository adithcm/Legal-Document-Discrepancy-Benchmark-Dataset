For list more products, Party B shall apply to Party A 3 working days in advance and after obtaining the consent of Party A, pay the deposit in full within 5 working days from the date of receipt of the deposit notice from Party A.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the payment period for the deposit to 1 working day after signing the agreement puts undue pressure on Party B and may violate fair business practice regulations, especially if such a short timeframe is not standard in similar agreements in China. It creates an unreasonably short deadline.",

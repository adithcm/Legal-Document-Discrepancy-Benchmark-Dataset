                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a five-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the notice period for termination to 5 days. Many jurisdictions, including some states in the United States, require a longer notice period for contract termination to ensure fair opportunity to mitigate damages or find alternative arrangements. This is especially relevant considering the talent's reliance on the contract and ESSI's potential dependence on the talent. This short notice could be deemed unreasonable and therefore legally challenged. Some states might have implied duties of good faith and fair dealing which could be seen to be violated by this shorter notice period.",

                "changed_text": "Said written approval must be given within one (1) business day of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the time for Talent to provide written approval to one business day. This could be argued as an unreasonably short period, especially considering the complexity of commercial placements and press releases. This timeline introduces a high probability of Talent failing to review and approve the placement in the given time, which violates the intent of Talent review. Therefore, the reduction to one business day, sets an unrealistic expectation, and thus creates a non-compliance issue. This is a conflict as it violates the spirit of fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "ESSI shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Talent in the event Talent fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice.",
                "changed_text": "ESSI shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Talent in the event Talent fails to perform the duties set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof or breaches any other covenant or agreement set forth herein and fails to cure same (if curable) within two (2) days of receipt of written notice.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation reduces the cure period from 7 days to 2 days and eliminates the 10-day notice period for termination, allowing for immediate termination. This could be deemed unreasonable and unconscionable, especially if the breach is minor or due to unforeseen circumstances. Many states have laws protecting individuals from overly harsh contract terms. The abbreviated cure period combined with immediate termination introduces a possible conflict of fairness and is therefore unlawful.",

                "changed_text": "Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right of set-off) Net seventy-five (75) days after the date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates payment 45 days after the invoice date. The modification extends the payment deadline to 75 days. This may contradict state prompt payment laws if Airspan is providing goods and services to Distributor. Many states, including some with statutes similar to the federal Prompt Payment Act, require payment within 30 days for commercial transactions, unless otherwise specified in a signed contract that complies with the law. This extended timeline of 75 days potentially violates these requirements.",

                "changed_text": "If Distributor disputes any invoice or part thereof, Distributor must notify Airspan in writing within five (5) days of the invoice date giving details of the reason for such dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows the Distributor 25 days to dispute an invoice. The modified version reduces this period to 5 days. This contradicts typical commercial reasonableness standards for dispute resolution. Given the complexity of invoices and potential for discrepancies, 5 days might be considered an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially conflicting with good faith dealing requirements under contract law and potentially violate the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which is implied in many US jurisdictions.",

                "changed_text": "For at least six (6) months after termination of this Agreement, Distributor will maintain its records, contracts, and accounts relating to distribution of Airspan Products, and will permit examination thereof by authorized representatives of Airspan at all reasonable times.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to six months may conflict with legal and regulatory requirements. Depending on the industry, tax laws, and applicable statutes of limitations for claims related to the Airspan products or the distributor's activities (e.g., breach of contract, warranty claims), a longer retention period might be legally mandated. Six months might be insufficient to satisfy legal requirements.",

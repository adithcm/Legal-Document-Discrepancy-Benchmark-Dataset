Within [***] of the modification or termination (other than sublicenses that expire at the end of a term previously specified in a Purchase Order) of any Customer Agreement, Allscripts will provide the Company with written notice of such modification or termination.",

In order to activate Merchant Processing Services for a Merchant Processing Services Customer, the proposed Merchant Processing Services Customer must submit (directly or indirectly through Allscripts) a completed Merchant Application and executed Merchant Agreement to the Company within 1 day from the execution by such Merchant Processing Services Customer of a Customer Agreement.

                "explanation": "By shortening the application submission timeframe to 1 day, the contract now creates a legal contradiction and potential non-compliance with consumer protection and fair business practices, which require a reasonable time for customers to review and understand contracts and service agreements. Also, the notification period of 90 days after the customer agreement has been modified or terminated is too long. It may cause potential harm to the clients, where it takes more time to inform about the modifications or termination.",

                "explanation": "The modified text extends the non-solicitation period to 10 years. This creates a potential legal issue as overly broad non-solicitation agreements can be deemed unenforceable restraints on trade, violating state laws designed to protect employee mobility and competition. The reasonableness of a non-solicitation clause depends on factors like duration and geographic scope. A 10-year restriction is likely to be challenged as unreasonably long in many jurisdictions, especially without specific justification.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property.",
                "changed_text": "STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within one hundred eighty (180) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within thirty (30) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property.",
                "explanation": "The modified text changes the timeframe for repairing damages to 180 days, potentially conflicting with Texas regulations or industry standards that may require faster remediation. Additionally, it reduces the time to restore the property after termination to 30 days which could also be a violation of what a 'reasonable time' would be and subject STW to breach of contract.",

                "explanation": "The modification reduces the written notice period required to terminate the agreement from 60 days to 30 days. Depending on Texas law regarding contract termination, or specific industry standards for water rights agreements, this shorter notice period could be deemed unreasonable or insufficient, leading to legal challenges.",

If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice, or fails to commence the curing of any default specified in such notice that is other than a monetary default within sixty (60) days from the date of the notice provided, then the non-defaulting party may pursue all legal or equitable remedies against the defaulting party.",

                "explanation": "The change reduces the cure period for both monetary and non-monetary defaults from 60 days to 30 days. This shorter cure period could be considered unreasonable, especially for complex defaults, and might conflict with Texas law or equitable principles requiring a fair opportunity to cure breaches of contract.",

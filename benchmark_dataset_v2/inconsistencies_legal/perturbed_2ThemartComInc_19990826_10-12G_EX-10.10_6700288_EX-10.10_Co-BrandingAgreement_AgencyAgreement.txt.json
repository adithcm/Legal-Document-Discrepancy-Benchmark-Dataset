Once every twelve (12) months, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than fifteen (15) days notice. i-Escrow shall within two (2) weeks make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of ten percent (10%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",
                "changed_text": "i-Escrow shall keep for one (1) year proper records and books of account relating to the computation of advertising payments owed to 2TheMart (including, as appropriate, the computation of the size of average Transaction).  Once every five (5) years, 2TheMart through a CPA may inspect and audit such records to verify reports. Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with i-Escrow's business activities and with no less than five (5) days notice. i-Escrow shall within thirty (30) days make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit. Such inspection shall be at 2TheMart's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the payments owed to date, i-Escrow shall immediately pay all cost of such audit.",
                "explanation": "This change alters the audit frequency from every 12 months to every 60 months (5 years), the notice period from fifteen (15) days to five (5) days, the overdue payment deadline from two (2) weeks to thirty (30) days, and the overdue payment percentage from ten percent (10%) to twenty percent (20%). These changes create non-compliance with standards as they unreasonably restrict the ability of 2TheMart to audit i-Escrow's records and make the action slower.",

                "explanation": "Decreasing the notice period for renewal from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15) days before expiration introduces a legal contradiction. While not a direct violation, it could be argued that this shorter period doesn't provide reasonable time for the other party to adequately assess and negotiate renewal terms. This could potentially be challenged under contract law principles related to fairness and good faith, particularly in California where good faith negotiation is often implied.",

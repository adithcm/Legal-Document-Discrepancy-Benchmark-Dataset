Pretzel Time agrees to give Franchisee, written notice, not more than thirty (30) days after receipt of Franchisee's notice of (a) Pretzel Time's  determination  whether or not it will grant Franchisee a Successor  Franchise  pursuant to this Section and/or (b) any deficiencies  in  Franchisee's  operation  of the Unit (or any other  failure to comply  with the terms of this  Agreement)  which could  cause  Pretzel  Time to refuse to grant a  Successor  Franchise.  Such notice  shall state what  actions Franchisee  must take to correct  the  deficiencies  and shall  specify the time period in which such  deficiencies  must be  corrected.  Pretzel Time shall give Franchisee written notice of a decision not to grant a Successor Franchise based upon  Franchisee's  failure to cure  deficiencies not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term of this Agreement. Such notice shall state the reasons for Pretzel Time's refusal to grant a Successor Franchise.  In the event Pretzel Time fails to give  Franchisee (a) notice of  deficiencies  in the Unit or in Franchisee's operation of the Unit, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Franchisee's timely election to obtain a Successor Franchise,  or (b) notice of Pretzel  Time's  decision not to grant a Successor  Franchise at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the term of this Agreement,  Pretzel Time  may  extend  the term of this  Agreement  for  such  period  of time as is necessary in order to provide Franchisee reasonable time to cure deficiencies or to provide ninety (90) days notice of Pretzel Time's  determination not to grant a Successor  Franchise.  The grant of a Successor Franchise shall be conditioned upon Franchisee's continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement until the date of expiration.",

The grant of a Successor Franchise shall be conditioned upon Franchisee's continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement until the date of expiration.",
                "explanation": "The modification shortens the notification period for renewal from six months to one month, and the notice period for deficiencies and non-renewal from 90 days to 30 days. This creates a potential violation of franchise laws, particularly the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it doesn't provide the franchisee sufficient time to address deficiencies or prepare for non-renewal.",

                "explanation": "The initial franchise term is reduced from 20 years to 5 years, while the renewal term in section 5.A is still for 5 years. This might be considered an unreasonably short initial term, especially considering the franchisee's investment, and it could raise concerns about the franchisor's good faith intentions, thus contradicting state franchise laws.",

                "explanation": "The payment deadline is expanded from fifteen days to ninety. Although it sounds like it will benefit the franchisee, it introduces uncertainty, particularly in states with prompt payment laws that mandate specific timeframes for businesses to pay debts upon contract termination. By significantly extending the deadline, the change undermines legal compliance and could invalidate enforceability.",

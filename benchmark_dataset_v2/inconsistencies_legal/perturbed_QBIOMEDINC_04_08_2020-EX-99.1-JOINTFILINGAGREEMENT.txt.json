Furthermore, the parties are not required to update information, even if there are changes to the ownership percentage.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts SEC Rule 13d-1(k), which requires timely filing of amendments to Schedule 13G. Allowing a year's delay and removing responsibility for accuracy and updates violates the requirement for prompt disclosure of material changes in ownership.",

The parties agree that the statement does not need to adhere to Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.",
                "explanation": "This modification fundamentally contradicts the core requirement of filing Schedule 13G statements and amendments, a direct violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its associated rules. Eliminating the filing obligation undermines transparency and regulatory oversight.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notice period to 15 days may be insufficient under New York law for certain types of commercial contracts, potentially leading to automatic renewal against a party's intentions, thus violating contract law principles ensuring reasonable notice.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract and potentially violating implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under New York law if the 15-day notice is deemed unreasonably short for the complexity or duration of the agreement.",

In the event the Company fails to have its attorney issue the required opinion letter within 20 days of a written request from YourNetPlus.com or its nominee, the Company shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of 10% interest per 30 days on the value of the shares based on the closing bid price of the Company's common stock on the 20th business day following the date it receives written notice from YourNetPlus.com or their nominee. The damages shall accrue until the transfer agent receives the opinion letter",
                "changed_text": "Once the common stock has been registered, or, after the one year period applicable under Rule 144, whichever occurs first, the Company will have its attorney issue an opinion letter for removal of the legend and release all stock transfer instructions on the common stock, except as maybe required under Rule 144. In the event the Company fails to have its attorney issue the required opinion letter within 5 days of a written request from YourNetPlus.com or its nominee, the Company shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of 50% interest per 5 days on the value of the shares based on the closing bid price of the Company's common stock on the 5th business day following the date it receives written notice from YourNetPlus.com or their nominee. The damages shall accrue until the transfer agent receives the opinion letter",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to issue an opinion letter to 5 days and increasing the liquidated damages to 50% interest per 5 days may be considered an unreasonable penalty under New York law, potentially violating the principle that liquidated damages should be a fair estimate of actual damages and not punitive. This introduces an inconsistency as it could be deemed unenforceable.",

The agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under prevailing New York law.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding and enforceable by any party to the arbitration and judgment shall be rendered upon it in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in New York.",

The agreement to arbitrate shall NOT be specifically enforceable under prevailing New York law.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding and NOT enforceable by any party to the arbitration and judgment shall NOT be rendered upon it in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in New York.",
                "explanation": "Changing the arbitration location to Nevada, granting the Provider sole selection of the arbitrator, mandating arbitration within 10 days, and stating that the agreement is not specifically enforceable under New York law creates inconsistencies with standard arbitration practices and enforceability. The arbitrator selection process is not neutral. The reduced arbitration timeframe may not provide sufficient opportunity for a fair hearing. Denying enforceability conflicts with the purpose of an arbitration agreement and New York law, undermining its effectiveness.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates principles of fair arbitration, potentially renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable under New York law, and conflicts with the FAA's aim to promote arbitration enforceability.",

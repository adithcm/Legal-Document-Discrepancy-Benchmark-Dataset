                "original_text": "During the Term, and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take measures it deems appropriate, but no specific measures are required, to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "California law, where Snap Technologies is located, and Delaware Law, where United Airlines is located, generally recognizes the enforceability of confidentiality agreements, but the enforceability of such clauses depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Reducing the protection period to one year may be deemed unreasonable for certain types of confidential information, such as trade secrets or sensitive business strategies, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable. Additionally, removing the requirement to take 'at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information' weakens the protection afforded to confidential information. Furthermore, there's a risk that a one-year term could be deemed insufficient given the nature of information exchanged, particularly if it includes trade secrets.",

                "original_text": "Either party may terminate the Term upon not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach hereof by such other party. In addition, either party may terminate the Term immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party shall fail to do business in the normal course or become subject to any bankruptcy, assignment for creditors, corporate dissolution or similar proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "Either party may terminate the Term upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the other party of any breach hereof by such other party. In addition, either party may terminate the Term immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party shall fail to do business in the normal course or become subject to any bankruptcy, assignment for creditors, corporate dissolution or similar proceeding.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination due to a breach to 10 days is unreasonable in most commercial contracts. For substantial breaches, the breaching party needs sufficient time to cure the breach. Ten days might be insufficient, leading to potential claims of wrongful termination, especially if cure periods are customary in similar agreements.",

                "original_text": "In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement for other than a material breach of this Agreement by Sponsor, upon notice from Sponsor delivered to Snap at least forty-five (45) days prior to such expiration or termination, Snap shall negotiate in good faith an agreement providing Sponsor with sponsorship rights similar to those described herein on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the event that an agreement between the parties is not executed within thirty (30) days following delivery, of such notice to Snap, Snap shall be free thereafter to enter into an such an agreement with any third party.",

In the event that an agreement between the parties is not executed within five (5) days following delivery, of such notice to Snap, Snap shall be free thereafter to enter into an such an agreement with any third party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period to exercise the right of first refusal from 45 days to 10 days, and the negotiation period from 30 days to 5 days, is commercially unreasonable. This places undue pressure on Snap to quickly assess and negotiate a complex sponsorship agreement. Such short timeframes may be considered insufficient for due diligence, legal review, and internal approvals, potentially making the right of first refusal practically useless and therefore unenforceable. The lack of sufficient time contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

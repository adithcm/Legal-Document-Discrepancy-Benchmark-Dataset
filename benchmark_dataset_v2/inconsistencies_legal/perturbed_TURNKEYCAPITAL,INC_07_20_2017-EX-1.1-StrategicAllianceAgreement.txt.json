                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, TKCI will keep in confidence, not reveal, not use and not allow or assist others to use, any information marked \"Confidential\" received from or through SIC in the context of its activities hereunder, except as authorized in writing by SIC.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for ninety (90) days thereafter, TKCI will keep in confidence, not reveal, not use and not allow or assist others to use, any information marked \"Confidential\" received from or through SIC in the context of its activities hereunder, except as authorized in writing by SIC.",
                "explanation": "Florida's Trade Secret Act provides broader protection for confidential information, and a one-year confidentiality period may be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets, potentially conflicting with legal expectations for trade secret protection. Reducing the term to 90 days is a legal contradiction, and is not enough to be reasonable.",

                "explanation": "Under Florida law, for some legal notices, a five-day window may be too short to ensure receipt and response, particularly concerning critical legal matters. Extending the notice period to 10 days could potentially violate laws or regulations requiring prompt notification.",

The Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive one (1) year terms, unless either party provides written notice of termination thirty (30) days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term.",
                "explanation": "Florida Statute Section 542.336, regarding restrictive covenants, mandates that any covenant extending beyond two years is presumed unreasonable. The automatic renewal provision, combined with the initial three-year term, could be deemed an unreasonably long restraint of trade, especially if the agreement contains non-compete clauses, conflicting with Florida law.",

                "original_text": "Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Imprimis shall deliver to Surgical a report setting forth for such calendar quarter the calculation of the applicable Sales Commission due under this Agreement for the sale of the Product (as defined in the SOW). Imprimis shall remit the total Sales Commission payments due for the sale of Product during such calendar quarter at the time such report is made.",

Imprimis shall remit the total Sales Commission payments due for the sale of Product during such calendar quarter at the time such report is made.",
                "explanation": "California law requires timely payment of wages and commissions. While a specific deadline for commission payments isn't explicitly defined, extending the reporting and payment timeframe to 120 days after each quarter could be considered an unreasonable delay, potentially violating California labor laws related to prompt payment.

                "explanation": "Requiring Surgical to return work product within 180 days contradicts the requirement that they should return it 'promptly' after termination, potentially impeding Imprimis' immediate access to crucial information and violating intellectual property protection principles, as a prompt transfer is expected to protect trade secrets and ensure continued business operations. Such delay is unreasonable and harms Imprimis.",

Specifically, failing to ensure the Sales Team is knowledgeable about the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute directly contradicts federal regulations aimed at preventing fraud and abuse in healthcare.

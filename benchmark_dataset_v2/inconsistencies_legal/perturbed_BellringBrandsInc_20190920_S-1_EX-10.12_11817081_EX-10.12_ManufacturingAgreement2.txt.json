                "original_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019. The MAOV [***] Units for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2019 through the end of the Term, contingent upon commercial aseptic production at Heritage's [***] facility and approval of that facility by Premier by January 1, 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] (the twelve-month periods and the six-month period are each a \"Contract Period\").",
                "changed_text": "During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.

                "explanation": "Changing the approval date of the facility to January 1, 2018 introduces a contractual impossibility, as it requires Premier to approve the facility *before* the agreement amendment was even effective (June 11, 2018). This creates an unachievable condition precedent for the MAOV requirement, potentially leading to contract disputes.",

                "explanation": "Requiring Premier's approval of Heritage's facility within 14 days of the contract amendment may be unreasonable and conflict with standard business practices, potentially imposing undue pressure on Premier. This could make the approval process flawed and subject to legal challenge for lack of sufficient due diligence. By potentially creating a situation where approval is rushed or incomplete due to time constraints, the approval may not be valid or legally sound. As written, this contradicts good faith business dealings.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be required to purchase' to 'may purchase... without any obligation' fundamentally alters the nature of the MAOV provision. It removes the mandatory aspect, turning it into a discretionary option. While seemingly innocuous, this contradicts the initial premise of a binding contract with agreed-upon minimum purchase volumes, potentially rendering the agreement illusory. This is because there's no actual commitment to purchase on Premier's part for the indicated period, therefore this section goes against the initial consideration of the Agreement.",

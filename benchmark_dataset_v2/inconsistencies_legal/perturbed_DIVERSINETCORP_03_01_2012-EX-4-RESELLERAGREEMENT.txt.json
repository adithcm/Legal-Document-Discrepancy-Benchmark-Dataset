                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period to 60 days, which may violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions if the standard payment term is 30 days or less. Many jurisdictions have regulations that enforce payment timelines to small businesses and subcontractors within a shorter timeframe.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the record-keeping period to two years contradicts standard accounting practices and potentially tax regulations, which often require businesses to retain financial records for a longer duration (e.g., 6-7 years in the US and Canada) for audit purposes. This change creates non-compliance.",

                "explanation": "Changing the notification period to 15 days from 5 days for postal mail can create legal issues. Many jurisdictions have statutory notification periods for legal notices (e.g., breach of contract, termination) that are shorter than 15 days. This could render contractual notifications invalid if they don't meet the legally required timeframe.",

                "changed_text": "\"TERM: The rights granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2006 (the \"Term\"); provided, however, that with respect to each Property, including Robots, Kingdom of Heaven, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, In Her Shoes, Idiocracy (Oww My Balls) and Ice Age II, all right and licenses granted herein will automatically terminate 30 days after the agreement is signed, regardless of current use or revenue generation. All existing licenses will cease without notice.\"",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential contradiction with general contract law principles regarding termination clauses. Abruptly terminating licenses 30 days after signing, irrespective of usage or revenue, may be deemed unreasonable, especially if substantial investments were made based on the original, longer term. This could be considered a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

The 'Legal Department' is under no obligation to forward this information to the correct internal departments, and failure to do so will not negate the notice.",
                "explanation": "This revision creates a potential issue with proper notification, particularly regarding legal matters. It removes the individual contact and places the onus on the 'Legal Department' without ensuring delivery or acknowledgement. This contradicts principles of due process and fair notice, especially if time-sensitive actions are required upon notification of a breach. By not mandating confirmation and absolving responsibility for internal forwarding, important notices could be missed, leading to unintended legal consequences. It also removes the contact email which is required for sending notices.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts fundamental contract law principles by granting one party (Fox) unilateral control over interpretation. Contract interpretation should be based on mutual intent, industry standards, and legal precedent. Granting Fox sole discretion and prioritizing their interpretation over industry norms or mutual understanding is likely unenforceable and violates principles of fairness and mutual agreement. A clause like this would make the contract unconscionable.",

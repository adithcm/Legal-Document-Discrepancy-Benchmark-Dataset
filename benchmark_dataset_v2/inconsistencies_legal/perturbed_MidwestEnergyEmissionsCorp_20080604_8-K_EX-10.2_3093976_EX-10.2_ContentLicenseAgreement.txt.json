                "original_text": "C. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable content agreement with such Licensor, the Net Advertising Revenue shall be calculated on a quarterly calendar basis (the \"Net Advertising Revenue Period\") and shall be payable no later than sixty (60) days after the termination of the preceding full quarter-annual period, i.e., commencing on the first (1st) day of January, April, July and October except that the first and last calendar periods may be \"short,\" depending on the effective date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "C. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable content agreement with such Licensor, the Net Advertising Revenue shall be calculated on a quarterly calendar basis (the \"Net Advertising Revenue Period\") and shall be payable no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the termination of the preceding full quarter-annual period, i.e., commencing on the first (1st) day of January, April, July and October except that the first and last calendar periods may be \"short,\" depending on the effective date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment of Net Advertising Revenue within 60 days of the quarter's end. By extending this to 120 days, the agreement becomes less favorable to the Licensor. Delayed payment terms could contradict standard business practices and prompt payment laws if the delay is unreasonable or causes undue hardship, though specific regulations vary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state-level prompt payment laws or breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the delay is deemed unreasonable.",

All books and records relative to COMPANY'S obligations to a particular Licensor hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to that Licensor for inspection at a location in Los Angeles, California for at least three (3) months after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires maintaining records for 12 months post-termination. Reducing this to 3 months could be problematic if statutes of limitations for relevant legal claims (e.g., breach of contract) extend beyond this period, thereby hindering the Licensor's ability to verify payments or pursue legal remedies.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflict with California's statute of limitations for breach of contract (typically 4 years for written contracts), which could be impacted by limiting record availability.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality period is three years. Reducing it to six months may be insufficient to protect trade secrets, especially considering the competitive landscape. This could contradict legal expectations for reasonable protection of confidential information, especially for intellectual property-heavy content licensing agreements.",

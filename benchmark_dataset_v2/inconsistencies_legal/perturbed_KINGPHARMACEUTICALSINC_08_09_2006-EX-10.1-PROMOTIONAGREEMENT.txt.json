                "original_text": "Each party shall notify the other: (i) of all Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports within forty-eight (48) hours of the time such Serious Adverse Drug Experience Report becomes known to such party (including its employees); and (ii) of all Adverse Drug Experience Reports within five (5) calendar days of the time such Adverse Drug Experience Report becomes known to such party (including its employees).",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates reporting of Serious Adverse Drug Experience Reports within 48 hours, which may be more stringent than required by law but is generally compliant. The modified text extends this deadline to 72 hours and extends the deadline for Adverse Drug Experience Reports to 10 calendar days. Although this might not violate a specific federal law, it contradicts the general requirements for prompt reporting and potentially introduces non-compliance with FDA guidelines that emphasize the need for timely reporting. The FDA requires safety reports to be submitted as soon as possible.",

Depomed shall within two business days provide King with copies of all such communications (including summaries of all relevant verbal communications) related to Promotional Materials and Serious Adverse Drug Experiences (except that routine communications as to such matters (e.g., FDA 2253 correspondence) may be forwarded to King within 5 business days). Depomed will consult with King concerning adverse drug reaction reporting to the FDA that Depomed reasonably considers to be significant to the Product, including regulatory responses to follow up inquiries regarding adverse drug reactions. Depomed will provide to King a copy of all draft responses related to such matters as soon as practicable, and will endeavor to provide them at least five business days in advance of their submission (to the extent allowable under Legal Requirements), and will consider in good faith any comments provided to Depomed by King.",

Depomed will provide King with copies of all such communications at their discretion. Depomed may consult with King concerning adverse drug reaction reporting to the FDA if they wish. Depomed will not be required to provide King with a copy of all draft responses related to such matters, unless required by law.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires Depomed to provide King with copies of communications with Government Authorities within two business days and consult with King on adverse drug reaction reporting. The modified text removes the mandatory timeline and replaces it with discretionary actions ('at their discretion,' 'may consult'), and removes the mandatory draft response sharing, potentially hindering King's ability to comply with its own regulatory obligations and creating inconsistencies with requirements for pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring.",

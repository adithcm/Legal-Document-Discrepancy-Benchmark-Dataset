                "explanation": "This modification extends the payment term to 90 days. While longer payment terms aren't inherently illegal, they can be deemed unconscionable or violate state-specific prompt payment laws if they significantly deviate from industry standards or impose undue hardship, especially for smaller suppliers. For example, in some states, payment terms exceeding a certain period (e.g., 60 days) may be subject to additional scrutiny.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state prompt payment laws or unconscionability under contract law.",

Each Party shall advise the other Party within 30 days of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the notification period to 30 days contradicts the requirement for prompt reporting of significant regulatory issues like FDA warnings. FDA regulations and other reporting guidelines necessitate rapid disclosure of events impacting product safety and regulatory compliance. A 30-day delay undermines this requirement.",

Qualigen shall provide notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "Removing the fixed deadline (3 business days) and replacing it with 'at its discretion' creates non-compliance.

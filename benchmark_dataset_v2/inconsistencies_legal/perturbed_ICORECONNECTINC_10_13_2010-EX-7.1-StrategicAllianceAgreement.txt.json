                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "changed_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled quarterly and funds distributed within 90 days after the end of each quarter by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous quarter (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates monthly revenue reconciliation and payment by the 20th of each month. The modification changes this to quarterly reconciliation and payment within 90 days, which may violate state laws requiring more frequent payments or accounting, impacting cash flow and financial transparency for parties. This is a contradiction to general payment terms expected within a month.",

                "changed_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires 90 days' notice for termination before renewal. The modification reduces this to 30 days, which might violate standard commercial contract laws or specific industry regulations that require longer notice periods to allow adequate time for transition and winding down of the agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of standard commercial contract laws related to termination notice periods.",

                "explanation": "The original contract mandates reimbursement of legal expenses within 60 days. The modification extends this to 180 days, which could contravene prompt payment laws or principles of fairness, especially if the delay imposes undue financial burden on IMedicor, potentially violating industry standards for timely settlements.",

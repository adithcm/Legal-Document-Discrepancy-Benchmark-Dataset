                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "changed_text": "All revenue sharing will be reconciled quarterly and funds distributed 90 days following the end of each quarter by wire transfer for all net collected revenues (net of returns and refunds, if any).",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment terms from monthly to quarterly and extending the distribution timeframe to 90 days following the quarter's end can create cash flow issues, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws in some states that mandate more frequent payment schedules. For example, in some states, delaying payments beyond a reasonable period could be seen as a breach of contract or a violation of fair business practices.",

                "original_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least sixty 90 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period from 90 days to 15 days may violate state laws requiring longer notice periods for contract termination, potentially leading to legal disputes and rendering the termination clause unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws requiring reasonable notice periods for contract termination.",

                "explanation": "Extending the reimbursement period for legal fees and damages from 60 to 180 days could conflict with statutes or case law regarding timely payment obligations, especially in jurisdictions with stricter rules on prompt payment for legal services or indemnity claims. This modification could be seen as unreasonably delaying compensation.",

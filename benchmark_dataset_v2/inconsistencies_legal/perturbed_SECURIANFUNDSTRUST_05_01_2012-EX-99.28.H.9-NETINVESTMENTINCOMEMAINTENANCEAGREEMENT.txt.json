If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 90 days after each fiscal year-end.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires reimbursements to be made within 30 days after each month-end, which aligns with standard industry practice and regulatory expectations for fund operations. The modification extends these periods to 60 days after each quarter-end for the Investment Adviser's reimbursement and 90 days after each fiscal year-end for the Fund's payment. This creates a potential conflict because such extended payment terms may not provide timely compensation necessary to maintain financial stability and could violate requirements for prompt financial settlements.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates annual renewal with approval by disinterested trustees. The modified text extends the initial term to five years and removes the requirement for disinterested trustee approval, only requiring a simple majority of trustees regardless of their conflicts of interest. This could be problematic under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates that certain agreements be reviewed and approved by disinterested parties to protect the interests of the fund and its shareholders.",

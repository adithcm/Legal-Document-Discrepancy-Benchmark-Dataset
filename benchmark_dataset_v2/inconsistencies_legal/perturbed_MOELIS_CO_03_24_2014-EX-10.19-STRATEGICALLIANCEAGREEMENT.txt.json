                "original_text": "Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 12 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.",
                "changed_text": "Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 36 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 36 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.",
                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to 36 months may be deemed overly broad and unreasonable in some jurisdictions, potentially conflicting with state laws regarding employee mobility and trade restrictions. California, for example, generally disfavors non-compete agreements and restrictions on employment.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year for all confidential information could be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets or other sensitive business information, particularly in industries where information has a longer useful life, this could contradict common business practices and potentially lead to legal challenges based on inadequate protection of proprietary information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state, but potentially conflicts with trade secret laws like the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) or state equivalents if the shorter period fails to provide reasonable protection.",

At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal or termination to one month may be considered commercially unreasonable, especially given the strategic nature of the alliance and the potential disruption caused by a sudden termination. This short notice period could be seen as violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts under United States Law.",

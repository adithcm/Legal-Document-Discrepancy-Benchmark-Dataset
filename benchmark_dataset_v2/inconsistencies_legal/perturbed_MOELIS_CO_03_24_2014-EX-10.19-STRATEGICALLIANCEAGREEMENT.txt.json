                "original_text": "Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 12 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered 8 Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.",
                "changed_text": "Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 3 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 3 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered 8 Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 12-month non-solicitation period for employees and clients. Reducing this period to 3 months may be considered unreasonably short under applicable laws, particularly in jurisdictions where such restrictions are intended to protect legitimate business interests and trade secrets. Courts often scrutinize the reasonableness of non-solicitation clauses.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by state; in the United States, courts consider the reasonableness of non-solicitation agreements based on factors like duration, geographic scope, and the nature of the business. Some states may view a 3-month period as insufficient protection.",

                "changed_text": "This Section 10.1 shall terminate with respect to Confidential Information relating to a (prospective) Client, six months following receipt of such information, and with respect to any other Confidential Information, six months following the termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Confidentiality agreements typically need to protect trade secrets for a commercially reasonable duration. Limiting the protection to six months may be insufficient and contradict legal standards for trade secret protection, especially considering the nature of strategic alliances which require the safeguard of sensitive information.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secret Law (state and federal, e.g., Defend Trade Secrets Act): Requires reasonable measures to protect trade secrets, including confidentiality agreements of sufficient duration.",

At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the 12 initial term. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a six-month notice for non-renewal or termination. Reducing this to one month could be deemed unreasonable, particularly in a strategic alliance involving complex financial relationships. Contract law requires that termination clauses provide a reasonable opportunity for parties to wind down their affairs.",
                "contradicted_law": "General Contract Law: Requires reasonable notice for termination, which is determined based on the nature of the contract and the investments made by the parties.",

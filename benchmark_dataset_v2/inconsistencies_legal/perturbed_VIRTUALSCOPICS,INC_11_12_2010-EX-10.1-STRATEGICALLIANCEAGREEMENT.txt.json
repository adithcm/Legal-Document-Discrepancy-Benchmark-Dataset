                "original_text": "e. VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within thirty (30) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within five (5) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for invoices to be submitted within 30 days, which is a reasonable timeframe. By changing it to 5 days, it creates an unreasonably short window for VS to prepare and submit invoices, potentially leading to a breach of contract due to late submissions, especially if there are delays in internal reporting or reconciliation. This can be seen as unconscionable and contradicts general principles of fair contracting.",

VS acknowledges and agrees that where VS's Services relate to a specific Sponsor's clinical research study, all payments under a Work Order are pass through payments from Sponsor and PPD shall not have any payment obligations until such payments are received from Sponsor. PPD shall use all reasonable diligence to obtain timely payment from Sponsor in order to make payment to VS within 45 days following the date of invoice receipt. In furtherance thereof, PPD shall ensure that Sponsor is invoiced no later than ten (10) days following PPD's receipt of VS's invoice, assuming such invoice was provided to PPD by VS in accordance herewith and provided that Sponsor's invoice requirements do not preclude the same. PPD shall ensure that VS is aware of any such Sponsor restrictions as soon as possible. Further, PPD shall ensure that payment is made to VS either by wire transfer or PPD check in accordance with PPD's applicable payment processes no later than ten (10) days following PPD's receipt of applicable funds from Sponsor; provided, however, that in the event such payment occurs more than 45 days following the date of PPD's receipt of VS' invoice, such payment shall be made by wire transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a Sponsor fails to issue payment to PPD, affecting PPD's ability to pay VS, the parties shall communicate with the other to jointly pursue communication with the Sponsor to address the nonÂ­payment.",

PPD is not obligated to pay VS if the Sponsor fails to pay PPD. PPD shall invoice Sponsor at its convenience. PPD shall pay VS at its discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a 45-day payment term upon receipt of invoice. The modified version removes the payment deadline altogether, stating that PPD is not obligated to pay if the Sponsor doesn't pay. Also, it changes the invoice time and payment time, giving PPD discretion. This contradicts standard business practices and potentially violates prompt payment laws in many jurisdictions, which require businesses to pay invoices within a reasonable timeframe. The change significantly increases the risk for VS, as it relies on PPD to pursue payment from the Sponsor, and PPD is given an unlimited time frame to process payment.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires VS to maintain insurance coverage for two years following the termination of the agreement, providing PPD with some assurance against potential future liabilities. The revised text removes the obligation to maintain insurance for two years after expiration or termination and states 'at its own discretion,' and also removes the requirement for VS to provide proof of insurance. This violates standard risk management practices and could expose PPD to significant financial risk if VS is negligent or commits misconduct during the term of the agreement. This could also violate certain state regulations that require certain types of insurance coverage for businesses.",

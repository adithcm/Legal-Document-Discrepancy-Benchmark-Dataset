                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date.",
                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 15 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds 90 days after the End Date.",
                "explanation": "Shortening the termination deadline to 15 days after the offering and delaying payment to 90 days after termination can create inconsistencies if state laws mandate longer periods for contract termination rights or faster payment of services rendered.  Tennessee law, like many states, implies a 'reasonable time' for contract performance if no specific date is given, and 90 days may be seen as unreasonable in this context.",

                "explanation": "Changing the reporting deadline to 180 days and delaying the start of the twelve-month period violates SEC Rule 158 under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires more timely reporting. Public companies are required to provide timely and accurate information to investors.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the lock-up period for selling shares to 15 days may conflict with standard underwriting practices and SEC regulations concerning market manipulation and stabilization following an IPO.  A longer lock-up period (often 90-180 days) is common to prevent insider selling from destabilizing the stock price immediately after the offering.",

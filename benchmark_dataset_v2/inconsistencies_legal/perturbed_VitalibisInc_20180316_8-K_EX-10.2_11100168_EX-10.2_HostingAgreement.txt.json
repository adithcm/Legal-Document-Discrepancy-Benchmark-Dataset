In addition, failure of Licensee to fully pay any fees within sixty (60) days after the applicable due date, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, justifying suspension of the performance of Services by VOTOCAST, and will be sufficient cause for immediate termination of this Agreement by VOTOCAST.",

Given that the agreement is based in California, a one-year confidentiality period could be deemed insufficient to adequately protect trade secrets or sensitive business information, especially considering the rapid pace of technological advancements. California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act provides protections for an undefined time (as long as it is a secret), which conflicts with this one-year term.",

                "original_text": "LeadersOnline shall limit contact with a Candidate to either one phone contact or one e-mail contact per calendar quarter, unless expressly agreed to by the Candidate.",
                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline shall have unlimited contact with Candidates and their information, including corporate Affiliates of LeadersOnline, without the written consent of the individual whose information would be disclosed.",
                "explanation": "This modification directly contradicts privacy laws and regulations that protect personal information and limit unsolicited contact. Specifically, it violates the implied consent and reasonable contact frequency principles found in many state data protection laws. The modification also fails to comply with the federal CAN-SPAM Act, which sets requirements for commercial email, including providing recipients with a clear opt-out method. Offering unlimited contact also clashes with California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and GDPR in Europe, where they have stringent requirements for processing personal data.",

                "changed_text": "LeadersOnline shall pay VerticalNet *** percent (***%) of LeadersOnline- VerticalNet Revenue, payable to VerticalNet at the company's discretion, with no specific due date.",
                "explanation": "By removing the specific due date for payment, the modified text contradicts basic contract law principles that require payment terms to be clearly defined and enforceable. It also potentially violates state prompt payment laws, which mandate specific timelines for payment in certain industries. Furthermore, the phrase 'at the company's discretion' introduces significant ambiguity, making the payment obligation unenforceable and conflicting with established commercial practices.",

                "changed_text": "If the amount owed by LeadersOnline to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 90 days of notice of such underpayment to LeadersOnline.",
                "explanation": "By changing the payment period to 90 days, this perturbation clashes with typical commercial practices and potentially violates state laws that mandate shorter payment terms, especially for smaller debts or specific types of transactions. The longer repayment period can also impact VerticalNet's cash flow, creating a financial burden that may contradict reasonable business expectations and standard accounting practices.",

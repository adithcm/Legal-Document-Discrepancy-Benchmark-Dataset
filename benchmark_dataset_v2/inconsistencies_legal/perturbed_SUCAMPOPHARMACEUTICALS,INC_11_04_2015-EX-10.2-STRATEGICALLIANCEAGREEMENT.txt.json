                "explanation": "Reducing the offer period to 10 business days creates a legal contradiction. Tender offer regulations in Japan and potentially the US (if SPI is considered to have sufficient nexus) typically require a minimum offer period that is longer than 10 business days to allow shareholders sufficient time to consider the offer and make informed decisions.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to 6 months for sensitive business information creates a legal contradiction because it may not provide adequate protection for trade secrets or confidential business strategies.

                "explanation": "Delaying the settlement date to 10 business days following the offer period can introduce inconsistencies since settlement must be completed as soon as practicable following the end of the offer period to ensure certainty for tendering shareholders. Delaying the settlement increases risks of market volatility or other events impacting the shareholders' decisions.",

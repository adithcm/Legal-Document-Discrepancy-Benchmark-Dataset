                "changed_text": "If Company fails to cure the identified breach within ten (10) days after the date of the notice, Investor may terminate this IP Agreement by written notice to Company.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten (10) days may be considered unreasonably short, particularly in complex commercial agreements involving intellectual property rights. Standard commercial practice often allows for a 30-day cure period, and some jurisdictions may view a shorter period as a violation of good faith and fair dealing, making the termination clause potentially unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the first change, reducing the cure period for the Investor to five (5) days creates an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This is especially problematic as Synchron, a California corporation, is listed as a principal in the IP agreement.",

In the event that such dispute is not resolved on an informal basis by the conclusion of the second negotiation session, or, if either Party has not participated in negotiation sessions as to which notice has been given (the last day of such time period, the \"Escalation to Mediation Date\"), either Party may initiate mediation under Article 18.02.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the initial negotiation period to two (2) business days might be considered insufficient, especially for complex IP disputes. Courts might view this as an unreasonable restriction on the opportunity to resolve disputes amicably, potentially undermining the enforceability of the dispute resolution clause. While there is no strict law that prevents this, a very short negotiation window could indicate lack of good faith attempt to resolve conflict.",

                "original_text": "The Fee shall be payable to Charity Tunes in two equal installments of $58,802.80  (plus applicable taxes) due to Charity Tunes on October 1, 2009 and November 1, 2009, respectively payable upon receipt of  invoice.",
                "changed_text": "The Fee shall be payable to Charity Tunes in two equal installments of $58,802.80  (plus applicable taxes) due to Charity Tunes 90 days after receipt of invoice.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment terms to 90 days after receipt of the invoice. While seemingly benign, delayed payment terms can violate laws related to prompt payment, particularly in industries where shorter payment cycles are standard or legally mandated to protect smaller businesses. The 90 days period removes standard of practice in Canada.",

Pin Codes entered for redemption after 11:59:59  pm PT on March 31, 2010 may be rejected as ineligible. The contents of this section are to be reflected in the Sponsor's rules  for the Promotion.",

                "explanation": "The modification significantly shortens the redemption period for the Pin Codes from approximately six months (October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010) to only one month (October 1, 2009 to October 31, 2009). This could be considered an unreasonably short redemption period, potentially conflicting with consumer protection laws if not clearly and conspicuously disclosed and if it unduly restricts consumers' ability to use the purchased product (POGO packs with Pin Codes).",

However, Sponsor is not obligated to actually distribute all pin codes to consumers during this period, and may elect to retain or destroy unused pin codes at its sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "Adding the statement that the sponsor is not obligated to distribute all pin codes and can retain or destroy them introduces a potential conflict if the promotion is advertised as providing a guaranteed benefit (the pin code) with the purchase of the product. This could be considered misleading advertising if a significant number of consumers purchase the product expecting a benefit that is not actually available to them because the sponsor chose not to distribute all the codes. This is especially pertinent if the product's price is inflated due to the promotion.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates advertising standards and consumer protection laws regarding misleading or deceptive marketing practices under Canadian Law.",

                "original_text": "PSS agrees that it will publish such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole discretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such publication.",
                "changed_text": "PSS agrees that it will publish such results at its convenience, with no obligation to adhere to any specific timeline, and will make a reasonable effort to notify the undersigned when such publication occurs. PSS is under no obligation to publish these results.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the guaranteed timeline (45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter) for publishing financial results. By stating that PSS has no obligation to adhere to any specific timeline and is under no obligation to publish these results, the contract now contradicts securities regulations that require timely and accurate financial reporting following a merger, making it difficult for shareholders to make informed decisions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Section 13 and related SEC rules regarding timely financial reporting.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned is permitted to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of their interests in, or reduce their risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned at any point, including the 30 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the Merger.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the restriction on selling or transferring shares immediately before the merger. Such sales close to the merger date can potentially be construed as insider trading or market manipulation, violating securities laws.",

                "explanation": "This modification completely removes PSS's obligation to file required reports under the Securities Exchange Act for the specified three-year period. This directly violates the Act's requirements for publicly traded companies, impairing shareholders rights to sell or transfer shares.",

                "original_text": "If Network 1 desires to exercise its rights under this Section it will give written notice to Affiliate  within  15  business  days  of  receipt of the Offer.  The failure by Network  1  to  exercise  its  rights within the 15-day period shall be deemed a waiver  of  such right.",
                "changed_text": "If Network 1 desires to exercise its rights under this Section it will give written notice to Affiliate within 5 business days of receipt of the Offer. The failure by Network 1 to exercise its rights within the 5-day period shall be deemed a waiver of such right.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the period for Network 1 to exercise its right of first refusal to 5 business days could be considered unreasonably short, particularly for complex transactions. This may conflict with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing present in contract law, particularly under Virginia and Nevada law (the states of incorporation for Network 1 and Affiliate respectively), potentially making the clause unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "The Affiliate's Fees outlined in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein shall be subject to modification by Network 1, at its discretion, upon the giving of five-days (5) prior written notification.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for fee modifications to 5 days is likely unreasonable and may violate state wage laws or the implied duty of good faith, particularly in states like California, where affiliate operations might exist, that have stricter requirements for changes in compensation agreements. Such a short notice period does not provide sufficient time for the Affiliate to adjust its business operations or seek alternative arrangements, potentially making the modification clause unconscionable.",

This Agreement will automatically renew for successive  one-year  terms  unless  terminated by either party by providing the other  with  30  days  written notice that this Agreement will not be renewed or Affiliate  enters  into  a  Processing  agreement  with  Network  1  and  an ISO Sponsorship  agreement  with  Harris  Bank  in  which  case  this Agreement will automatically  terminate  concurrent  with  the  execution  of  such agreements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for non-renewal to 10 days is likely unreasonable, especially considering the potential impact on the Affiliate's business operations. This could violate state franchise laws or laws related to the termination of commercial agreements, particularly if the Affiliate has made significant investments in reliance on the agreement. Many states require longer notice periods to allow parties to wind down operations or find alternative arrangements. Therefore, this clause may not be enforceable.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential legal contradiction because it mandates a very short turnaround time (24 hours) for the distributor to begin distributing the latest version of the Distribution Products following Google's request. Depending on the scope and complexity of the distribution, this timeframe might be unreasonably short and could be deemed commercially unfeasible or practically impossible, potentially conflicting with laws requiring reasonable notice and opportunity to comply with contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction because it removes a fixed payment timeline, giving Google complete discretion over when payments are made. This violates principles of contract law requiring definite and certain payment terms and could be seen as an 'illusory promise,' rendering the payment obligation unenforceable. Labor and wage laws, depending on jurisdiction, may also mandate specific payment schedules.",

                "changed_text": "Google shall pay to Distributor any undisputed amounts which have accrued from the time of the most recent payment to Distributor through the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement only if Google deems it appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a legal contradiction because it gives Google complete discretion over whether or not to pay undisputed amounts owed to the distributor after the contract's termination. This violates fundamental contract law principles requiring parties to fulfill their financial obligations under a contract. It also undermines the concept of 'undisputed amounts', effectively rendering the obligation unenforceable. This could potentially conflict with laws related to final payment of services rendered, depending on the nature of the 'undisputed amounts.'",

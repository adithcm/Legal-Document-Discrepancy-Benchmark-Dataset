                "original_text": "If any Party pays any taxes that should have been borne by the other Party in accordance with Law, such other Party shall reimburse such Party within seven (7) days after its receipt of documentation evidencing such tax payment so incurred by such Party.",
                "changed_text": "If any Party pays any taxes that should have been borne by the other Party in accordance with Law, such other Party shall reimburse such Party within one hundred and eighty (180) days after its receipt of documentation evidencing such tax payment so incurred by such Party.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires reimbursement of taxes within 7 days, which contradicts typical tax regulations that allow for longer periods to reconcile and process payments. This change extends the reimbursement period to 180 days, potentially violating regulations that mandate quicker tax settlements or create inconsistencies with standard accounting practices required by PRC law.",

The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.",
                "changed_text": "Any Dispute which remains unresolved within fifteen (15) days after the date of such written notice shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (the \"Commission\") to be finally settled by arbitration in Beijing, PRC in accordance with the Commission's then effective rules (the \"Rules\") and this Section 10.12. The language of the arbitration shall be Mandarin Chinese.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows 60 days for dispute resolution before arbitration. Reducing this to 15 days is likely to be insufficient for meaningful negotiation or mediation, potentially violating legal norms that emphasize good faith negotiation before resorting to arbitration. This might also contradict procedural fairness standards required under PRC arbitration law.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement allows 90 days for transition after termination. Reducing this period to 15 days may be insufficient for the Licensee to effectively transition its business, potentially violating fair competition or business continuity principles implied in PRC commercial law. It could lead to undue hardship and contradict reasonable expectations, especially if the termination is not due to the Licensee's fault.",

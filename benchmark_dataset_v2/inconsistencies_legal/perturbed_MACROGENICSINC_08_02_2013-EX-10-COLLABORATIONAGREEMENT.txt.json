                "original_text": "Each purchase order shall set forth a delivery date for the quantities of Product ordered, which date will in no event be less than *** from the date of the purchase order. MacroGenics will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to deliver each order on or before the applicable deliver date.",
                "changed_text": "Each purchase order shall set forth a delivery date for the quantities of Product ordered, which date will in no event be less than 15 days from the date of the purchase order. MacroGenics will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to deliver each order on or before the applicable deliver date.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies that MacroGenics is required to deliver purchase orders within a time frame designated by asterisks. By changing it to a specific time frame of 'no less than 15 days,' this change can introduce non-compliance if the actual manufacturing and delivery lead times, in reality, require a longer period under the law. This imposes an unfeasibly short deadline, potentially causing breach of contract and regulatory issues.",

                "changed_text": "Green Cross shall pay to MacroGenics the Net Sales milestone payments set forth below, which shall be due and payable within 18 months after the end of the first Calendar Year during which such milestone is triggered.",
                "explanation": "The original contract provides that milestone payments are due within an unspecified period of time designated by asterisks. Modifying the text to state milestone payments are to be paid 'within 18 months' contradicts standard business practice, which dictates that payments are usually made after an audit has been performed. Eighteen months is an unreasonable delay for audits and payments and therefore, not in line with standards of regulations for financial reporting.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement requires prompt notification of patent or trademark infringement but uses asterisks for the exact deadline. This is modified to '180 days', which could be considered an unreasonable delay. Under patent and trademark laws, delays in reporting infringement can harm the ability to enforce intellectual property rights, potentially causing loss of rights.",

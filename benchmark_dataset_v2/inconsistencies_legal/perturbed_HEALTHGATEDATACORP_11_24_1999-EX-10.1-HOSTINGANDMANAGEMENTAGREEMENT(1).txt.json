                "original_text": "HealthGate shall collect the Article Fees established by Publishers plus a service fee to be determined by HealthGate but in any event the service fee may not exceed 30% of the Article Fee for the particular article, or $US 4, whichever is the higher. Within 60 days of the end of each calendar month, HealthGate shall forward to Publishers the net Article Fees actually collected (exclusive of HealthGate's service fee).",
                "changed_text": "HealthGate shall collect the Article Fees established by Publishers plus a service fee to be determined by HealthGate. HealthGate shall forward to Publishers the net Article Fees actually collected (exclusive of HealthGate's service fee) within 120 days of the end of each calendar year.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates HealthGate to forward net Article Fees within 60 days of each month's end. The modified version extends this period to 120 days after each calendar year, which conflicts with standard and legally regulated payment terms requiring more frequent remittances. This also introduces ambiguity and potential delays, disadvantaging the Publishers.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract regarding timely payments. This violates general principles of contract law which require parties to adhere to agreed-upon payment schedules.",

                "original_text": "Invoices are payable within 60 days of receipt, with the exception of payments due under Clause 19.2, which shall be payable on the due date or on acceptance of the work, which ever is the later.",
                "changed_text": "Invoices are payable at HealthGate's discretion, no sooner than 180 days after receipt.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 60-day payment window. The modified text makes payment discretionary and extends the minimum payment timeframe to 180 days, contravening generally accepted and legally enforced prompt payment standards. This creates uncertainty and potential breach of contract by unilaterally altering payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, violating general principles of contract law regarding payment terms. Could also violate state-specific prompt payment laws if applicable.",

                "original_text": "Upon receipt of written notice from the Publishers that HealthGate is in default under this Agreement by failing to comply with the requirements of this Clause 33, or that HealthGate is in default under any provision regarding rights upon termination of this Agreement, HealthGate shall have ten (10) business days in which to cure such default. HealthGate acknowledges that, in the event HealthGate fails to cure such default within the specified time period, the Publishers would suffer irreparable harm, and HealthGate, hereby agrees that the Publishers would in such event be entitled to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction an order of specific performance, in addition to such other rights and remedies to which it may be entitled at law or in equity under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon receipt of written notice from the Publishers that HealthGate is in default under this Agreement, HealthGate shall have zero (0) business days in which to cure such default. HealthGate acknowledges that, in the event HealthGate fails to cure such default within the specified time period, HealthGate, hereby agrees that the Publishers would in such event not be entitled to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction an order of specific performance, nor any other rights and remedies to which it may be entitled at law or in equity under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows HealthGate ten business days to remedy a default. The modified version eliminates the cure period entirely and removes the Publishers' right to seek specific performance. This directly contradicts legal norms that provide reasonable cure periods for contract breaches and limits the legal remedies available to the Publishers, potentially violating principles of fairness and good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, violating implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Restrictions on remedies may be unenforceable under contract law.",

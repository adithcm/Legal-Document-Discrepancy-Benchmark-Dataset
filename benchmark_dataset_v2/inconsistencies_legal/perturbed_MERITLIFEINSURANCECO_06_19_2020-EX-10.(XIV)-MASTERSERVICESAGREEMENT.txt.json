                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice period for termination to five days may conflict with state laws requiring longer notice periods for contract termination, particularly if the contract is interpreted as an ongoing service agreement where more extended notice is reasonable and customary.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with state laws regarding reasonable notice for contract termination, varying by jurisdiction and contract type. U.S. contract law often implies a 'reasonable' notice period which may exceed five days.",

Neither party shall, during the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year after its termination, solicit for hire as an employee, consultant or otherwise any of the other party's personnel who have had direct involvement with the Services, without such other party's express written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.",

Neither party shall, during the term of this Agreement and for six (6) months after its termination, solicit for hire as an employee, consultant or otherwise any of the other party's personnel who have had direct involvement with the Services, without such other party's express written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-solicitation period to six months may be deemed insufficient and unenforceable in certain jurisdictions where the protection of trade secrets and confidential information necessitates a longer period. Courts consider the nature of the industry, the employee's access to sensitive data, and the reasonableness of the restriction.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with state laws regarding the enforceability of non-solicitation agreements. Some states may find a six-month period unreasonable depending on the circumstances, making the clause unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the advance notice for rate changes to 10 days may be considered commercially unreasonable and could violate implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if the contract relies on established industry norms or standards for notice periods. This could lead to disputes and unenforceability.",

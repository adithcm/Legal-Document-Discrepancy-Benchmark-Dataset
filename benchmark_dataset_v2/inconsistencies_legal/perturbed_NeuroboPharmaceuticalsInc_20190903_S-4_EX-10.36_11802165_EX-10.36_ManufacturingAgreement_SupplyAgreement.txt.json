                "original_text": "3.3 Within [***] days after receipt of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo hereunder, NeuroBo may, in its discretion, perform a quality control test (the \"Product Test\") in accordance with the methods of the test on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for acceptance (the \"Product Test Methods\"), which shall be separately agreed in writing by and between Dong-A and NeuroBo and attached hereto as Exhibit B, as may be amended by the Parties' agreement in writing from time to time. Dong-A shall provide NeuroBo with all available information and technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously.",
                "changed_text": "3.3 NeuroBo forfeits its right to perform a quality control test if the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo are not tested within 5 days of receipt. This is a final and non-negotiable term. Dong-A's responsibility to provide information and technical assistance is waived after the delivery of Licensed Products.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a perturbation by significantly reducing the time frame for quality control testing and waiving Dong-A's responsibility. This could be considered an unreasonable restriction that contradicts standard commercial practices where adequate time for inspection is essential and potentially violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under New York law, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of their contractual obligations.",

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 Upon agreement by the Parties of the Firm Order, Dong-A shall issue to NeuroBo an invoice in Korean Won for each shipment of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo based on the Firm Order. NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price no later than 1 day prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A. Failure to submit the payment 1 day before the shipment date will result in an automatic cancellation of the order.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows for a payment period prior to the shipment date. The modified version drastically shortens this period to just 1 day before shipment, potentially creating an unreasonable payment term. Such a short payment window could be seen as commercially unreasonable and may violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by not providing sufficient time for payment processing, especially considering international wire transfers. This creates an inconsistency that could be deemed unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "5.3 A Party may terminate this Agreement by notice to the other Party if the other Party is in material breach of any provision of this Agreement, and the terminating party can terminate the agreement immediately without providing prior notice of the breach.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows a period to cure the breach. The modified version contradicts this aspect and allows to terminate the agreement immediately. By removing the cure period, this change is contradictory to standard contractual practices and may violate principles of fairness and reasonableness under contract law. New York law generally requires parties to provide an opportunity to cure a breach before terminating a contract, especially for non-major breaches.",

                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Software, but in no event later than December 1, 1999, Corio shall test the Software for conformance with the Documentation (\"Acceptance Test\"). If the Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation, then Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of its acceptance of the Software. In the event Corio finds material errors or defects with the Software, Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of such errors or defects and provide adequate detail to facilitate Commerce One replicating the error or defect. Upon receipt of written notice, Commerce One shall have fifteen (15) days to correct the defect, reinstall the Software at the Corio site and re-perform the Acceptance Test. If Corio does not accept the Software after the second Acceptance Test, a third Acceptance Test will be performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Acceptance Testing shall be complete by December 30, 1999, and Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of it's acceptance or rejection of the Software no later than December 31, 1999. If after the third Acceptance Test Corio does not accept the Software, Corio may, at its sole option, elect to (i) repeat the Acceptance Test or (ii) terminate the Agreement and receive a refund of any fees paid to Commerce One as of such date. Both parties acknowledge that any professional services provided to Corio subsequent to the installation and acceptance of the Software are non-essential for the purpose of the acceptance of the Software.",
                "changed_text": "Within five (5) days of delivery of the Software, but in no event later than November 5, 1999, Corio shall test the Software for conformance with the Documentation (\"Acceptance Test\"). If the Software performs in substantial accordance with the Documentation, then Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of its acceptance of the Software. In the event Corio finds material errors or defects with the Software, Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of such errors or defects, but Corio is not obligated to provide detail to facilitate Commerce One replicating the error or defect. Upon receipt of written notice, Commerce One shall have two (2) days to correct the defect, reinstall the Software at the Corio site and re-perform the Acceptance Test. If Corio does not accept the Software after the second Acceptance Test, a third Acceptance Test will be performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Acceptance Testing shall be complete by November 10, 1999, and Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing of it's acceptance or rejection of the Software no later than November 11, 1999. If after the third Acceptance Test Corio does not accept the Software, Corio's sole recourse is to repeat the Acceptance Test. Both parties acknowledge that any professional services provided to Corio subsequent to the installation and acceptance of the Software are non-essential for the purpose of the acceptance of the Software.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the time for acceptance testing and defect correction to a period that is unreasonably short, especially for complex software. This could violate implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, as Corio does not have sufficient time to adequately assess the software's suitability. It also removes the option for a refund, further limiting Corio's remedies.",

                "changed_text": "Maintenance and Support Fees: Net 90 of Software acceptance anniversary date, and each year thereafter.",
                "explanation": "This change extends the payment terms for maintenance and support fees to 90 days. While seemingly beneficial to Corio, it creates a situation where Commerce One may be providing services for an extended period without prompt payment. Should Corio fail to pay within 90 days, Commerce One's remedies may be limited or delayed, potentially conflicting with standard commercial law regarding timely payment for services rendered. In some jurisdictions, excessively long payment terms may be considered an unfair business practice.",

                "changed_text": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other party with written notification at least five (5) days prior to the expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the notification period for non-renewal to only five days. This is an unreasonably short period, as it does not provide the other party with sufficient time to make alternative arrangements, potentially creating economic hardship. Such a short notice period may be deemed unconscionable and therefore unenforceable under general contract law principles, particularly if one party has significantly more leverage than the other.",

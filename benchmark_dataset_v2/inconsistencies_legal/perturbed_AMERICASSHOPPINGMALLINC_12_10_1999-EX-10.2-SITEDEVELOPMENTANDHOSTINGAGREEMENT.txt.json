                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "HDI shall have the Site fully operational and accessible on demand by users of the Internet no later than sixty (60) days from the date this Agreement has been executed by both Parties. In the event that HDI fails to have the Site fully operational within seventy (70) days from the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty.",
                "changed_text": "HDI shall have the Site fully operational and accessible on demand by users of the Internet no later than thirty (30) days from the date this Agreement has been executed by both Parties. In the event that HDI fails to have the Site fully operational within thirty-five (35) days from the date of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides HDI 60 days to make the site fully operational. Reducing this to 30 days may be unreasonable depending on the complexity of the site, potentially conflicting with industry standards for reasonable time to deliver a project. If the state mandates a 'reasonable timeframe' exceeding this deadline for project completion, this creates a conflict. Reducing the grace period to terminate to 35 days after the agreement also creates a stricter condition on HDI.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; potential conflict with state laws requiring 'reasonable time' for contract performance (specific state law depends on jurisdiction, defaulting to United States law).",

                "changed_text": "Payments to HDI shall be due monthly within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar month and shall be accompanied by documentation reasonably detailing the calculation of the payment.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment due date to 45 days after the end of each month could conflict with prompt payment laws in some states (e.g., for construction projects or services), which often mandate shorter payment timelines, e.g., 30 days or less. Since the contract does not state a specific project this perturbation can be viewed as potential conflict depending on the type of project it may fall under.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires ninety (90) days written notice prior to the termination date. Changing the notice period to 15 days contradicts the original agreement of 90 days, therefore, the change introduces legal inconsistencies because the original contract requires 90 days, and some states also requires 30 to 60 days notices of contracts, so reducing it to 15 days may be a violation.",

                "original_text": "Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter's invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",
                "changed_text": "Within thirty (30) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter's invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within three (3) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides 15 days for payment after receiving the invoice and a 10-day cure period following a notice of non-payment. The change extends the payment period to 30 days, which may be seen as favourable to the customer but it reduces the cure period to 3 calendar days after notice of non-payment. In many jurisdictions, a 10-day cure period after a payment default is considered standard and reasonable, while a 3-day cure period may be deemed unconscionably short, particularly for large commercial transactions, creating an unreasonable burden on the Customer. This may also be a contradiction to general contract law principles requiring a reasonable opportunity to cure a default.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives a 24-month period for questioning an invoice. The modified text reduces it to 6 months. While a shorter period isn't inherently illegal, it could be deemed unreasonably short in certain jurisdictions, especially for complex financial transactions where errors may not be immediately apparent. A 6-month period may contradict accounting regulations or statutes of limitations for certain types of claims related to the invoice, depending on the applicable jurisdiction.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a 30-day notice for termination after the initial term. The modification reduces the notice period to 5 days. In certain industries or jurisdictions, a 5-day notice may be deemed commercially unreasonable or insufficient to allow the other party to make alternative arrangements, potentially conflicting with good faith and fair dealing principles implied in contract law. This is more pertinent in Gas Transportation Agreements that require reasonable transition periods to avoid disruptions.",

                "original_text": "The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties shall first seek to solve any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement through negotiation. If the Parties fail to solve such dispute through negotiation, each Party shall have the right to issue notice (\"Dispute Notice\") to the other Party, and such Dispute Notice shall include the content of the dispute. If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within fifteen (15) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for a 60-day negotiation period before arbitration. Reducing this to 15 days may conflict with standard commercial dispute resolution practices and could be seen as an unreasonably short timeframe, potentially hindering good-faith negotiations. Best practice and laws might encourage a longer negotiation window to foster resolution before escalating to arbitration, although there is no fixed legal period.",

                "original_text": "The notices and other expressions of intent for the purpose of this Agreement shall be deemed received: when delivered by express delivery or personal delivery, at the actual time of receipt; when delivered by mail, at the actual time of receipt or 72 hours after mailing (whichever is earlier).",
                "changed_text": "The notices and other expressions of intent for the purpose of this Agreement shall be deemed received: when delivered by express delivery or personal delivery, at the actual time of receipt; when delivered by mail, at the time of mailing, regardless of receipt.",
                "explanation": "Changing the receipt timeframe for mailed notices to 'at the time of mailing, regardless of receipt' creates a legal contradiction. Standard legal practice requires proof of receipt or a reasonable allowance for delivery time. This modification means a notice is considered received even if it is lost in the mail and never actually received, potentially violating due process and principles of fair notice.",

However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to disclosure made to the board of the directors, management team, and relevant employees who need to know such information, attorneys, accountants, financial counsel, and competent authorities for the purposes of performing this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "Excluding the board of directors, management team, attorneys, and financial counsel from the list of those to whom confidential information can be disclosed introduces a conflict. These parties often have a legal and fiduciary duty to be informed, and preventing disclosure to them could violate corporate governance regulations and professional obligations. This could also hinder the ability to properly execute and perform the agreement, as legal and financial advice would be impossible to obtain without breaching the confidentiality clause.",

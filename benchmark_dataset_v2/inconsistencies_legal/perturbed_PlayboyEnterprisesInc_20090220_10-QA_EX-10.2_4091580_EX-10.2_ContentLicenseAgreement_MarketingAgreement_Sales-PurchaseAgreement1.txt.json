The Royalty calculation period shall begin upon the first order received by EFS via any order channel (e.g., on a Website, via mail, fax or telephone) and shall be paid to Client within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of each calendar quarter (\"Calendar Quarter\") based on the calendar year (\"Year\"), as calculated on the actual Merchandise Gross Margin and Net Merchandise Sales (each as defined below) for such Calendar Quarter.",

                "explanation": "By changing the payment deadline from 15 days to 90 days after the end of each calendar quarter, the contract introduces a delay in payment. Many jurisdictions have laws regarding prompt payment, and a 90-day delay could potentially violate these laws, particularly if it's significantly longer than industry standards or legal allowances. This is more apparent if eFashion Solutions, LLC is providing a service rather than solely selling a product.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment term to 180 days may violate state-level prompt payment laws, which mandate payment within a reasonable timeframe. This timeframe often falls far short of 180 days, especially if the Client inventory is already received. The delay could be seen as an unfair business practice, leading to potential legal challenges.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction by delaying the payment of underpaid amounts following an audit. Labor laws and wage regulations often require prompt correction of payment errors. Mandating a 180-day waiting period after the audit results are communicated could violate these regulations, particularly those pertaining to wage and hour laws requiring timely and accurate compensation.",

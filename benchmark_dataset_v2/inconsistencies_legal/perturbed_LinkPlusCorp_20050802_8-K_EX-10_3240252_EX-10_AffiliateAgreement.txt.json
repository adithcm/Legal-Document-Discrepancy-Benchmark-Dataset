                "original_text": "Payments due shall be made within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter.",
                "changed_text": "Payments due shall be made within 90 days of the close of each calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "Maryland law (and general contract law principles) require prompt payment terms that are reasonable within the industry. Extending the payment term to 90 days without a clear justification might be considered unreasonable, especially if the standard industry practice is shorter, creating a potential legal challenge regarding the fairness and enforceability of the payment terms.",

                "explanation": "Maryland usury laws limit the amount of interest that can be charged on a debt. Charging 25% interest annually may exceed the legal limits for commercial transactions, making this clause potentially unenforceable and exposing the lender to legal penalties.",

                "explanation": "The original contract shortens the statute of limitations, but this modification further reduces the limitations period to six months. Maryland law generally provides a three-year statute of limitations for contract claims. Reducing this period to six months might be deemed unreasonably short, especially given the complexities of potential disputes. It could be argued that this unreasonably short period limits a party's ability to effectively pursue legal remedies, rendering the clause unenforceable.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B should pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the 15t h of each month.",
                "changed_text": "Deducting the dues of Party A, Party B should pay Party A the energy saving service fee of the last month before the last day of each month.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates payment by the 15th of each month. The modified text changes the payment deadline to the end of the month. This could potentially violate laws regarding payment deadlines, depending on the specific regulations in Shandong Province, China (where Party B is located), or, lacking clarity, under US federal law, which generally requires prompt payment and could deem delaying payment until the end of the month as unreasonable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws in Shandong Province, China, or similar regulations under US federal law if Chinese law is not applicable.",

                "original_text": "If Party B fails to pay Party A the energy saving service fee by 15t h of the month and the delay is within 60 days, the daily penalty is 0.05% of the overdue payment.",
                "changed_text": "If Party B fails to pay Party A the energy saving service fee by 15t h of the month and the delay is within 180 days, the daily penalty is 0.05% of the overdue payment.",
                "explanation": "Changing the delay period to 180 days before action can be taken is not necessarily illegal, but may be an abnormally long time and commercially unreasonable, especially given penalty is minimal at 0.05%/day. However, this may run afoul of regulations, as generally debts must be pursued far earlier than 6 months in the US. Furthermore, the excessively long period of delay before enforcement is commercially unreasonable and could be challenged in court as an unconscionable contract term.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates standard collection timelines and commercial reasonability principles under US contract law.",

                "original_text": "If the power plant cannot operate properly due to the shutdown of furnaces, facilities, or valves of Party B and such failure cannot be corrected upon a written notice from Party A to Party B within two days of occurrence of such event, Party B shall compensate the actual loss of Party A.",
                "changed_text": "If the power plant cannot operate properly due to the shutdown of furnaces, facilities, or valves of Party B and such failure cannot be corrected upon a written notice from Party A to Party B within one day of occurrence of such event, Party B shall compensate the actual loss of Party A.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the correction period to one day is unreasonable and potentially breaches fairness principles. One day is most likely not enough time to address issues. If a force majeure is present, but is not considered by Party A, there is a large disparity in damages. A very short cure period may violate fair business practice depending on the reason for stoppage. Since this agreement lacks a good-faith dealing clause, it may violate common law practices of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates common law principles of good faith and fair dealing under US contract law.",

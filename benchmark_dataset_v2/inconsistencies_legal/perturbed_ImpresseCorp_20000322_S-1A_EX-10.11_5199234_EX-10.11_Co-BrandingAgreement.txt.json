                "original_text": "4.8. AUDITS. During the term of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, VerticalNet shall have the right to appoint a certified public accountant to audit Impresse's financial records relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of Impresse's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid hereunder, but no more frequently than once per year. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was overpaid, the excess amount paid shall be returned by VerticalNet within 15 days of notice of such overpayment. VerticalNet shall give reasonable advance notice to Impresse of such audit and each audit shall be conducted in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by Impresse. The results of any such audit shall be deemed to be Confidential Information and may not be disclosed by either party or its certified public accountants except as may be necessary to enforce such party's rights.",

If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid, the additional amount owed shall be paid to VerticalNet within 5 days of notice of such underpayment to Impresse. If the amount owed by Impresse to VerticalNet was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to VerticalNet within 5 days of notice of such to Impresse.

                "explanation": "Changing the payment deadline for underpaid amounts to 5 days could be considered an unreasonably short time frame and could be challenged under general contract law principles related to fairness and reasonable opportunity to cure, especially considering the complexity of auditing financial records. Delaying the overpayment return to 60 days contradicts general business practices requiring prompt reimbursements.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event of any material breach of a term of this Agreement by such other party that remains uncured 30 days after written notice of such breach was received by such other party or, if the breach is not reasonably capable of cure within 30 days, such longer period, not to exceed 60 days, so long as the cure is commenced within the 30-day period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible and in any event within 60 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days (extendable to 20 days) may be deemed unreasonable under contract law. A 30-day cure period is often considered standard, and depending on the nature of the breach, 10 days may not provide sufficient time for a party to rectify the issue, making the termination clause potentially unconscionable or unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the statute of limitations for claims related to the agreement to six months, especially including claims of fraud or misrepresentation, is likely to be deemed unreasonable and may be unenforceable in many jurisdictions.  Statutes of limitations for fraud are typically longer than six months, and a drastically shortened period could be viewed as against public policy, limiting the ability of a party to adequately investigate and pursue a claim.",

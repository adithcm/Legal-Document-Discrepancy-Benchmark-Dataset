                "original_text": "Within thirty (30) days of the end of each payment quarter IntriCon must provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it or any Related Body Corporate. The statement must also include calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9. Any royalty due for payment by IntriCon to Dynamic Hearing is payable at the same time the statement is provided.",
                "changed_text": "Within sixty (60) days of the end of each payment quarter IntriCon may provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it or any Related Body Corporate. The statement should include, at IntriCon's option, calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9. Royalty payments are due 90 days after the statement is provided, or at IntriCon's convenience.",
                "explanation": "The modification alters the original text by extending the period for providing the statement, making it optional for IntriCon to include calculations of per-unit royalties, and delaying the due date for royalty payments. The extension from 30 to 60 days for the statement and adding 'or at IntriCon's convenience' for payments does not comply with standard business practices, potentially leading to delays and financial discrepancies.",

                "original_text": "IntriCon must make all such records available for inspection, copying and audit by an independent auditor appointed by Dynamic Hearing (and to which IntriCon has no reasonable objection) during ordinary business hours at any time during the Term and for a period of one year following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, provided that:",
                "changed_text": "IntriCon must make records available for inspection by an auditor of Dynamic Hearing's choosing, but only if IntriCon deems it convenient and after a thirty (30) Business Day notice period. These inspections are permitted solely during non-peak business hours, as defined by IntriCon, and cease immediately upon contract termination.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly restricts Dynamic Hearing's audit rights. Requiring a thirty (30) Business Day notice, limiting inspections to non-peak hours (as defined by IntriCon), and terminating audit access upon contract termination contradicts standard audit practices and legal principles ensuring reasonable access to records. It introduces uncertainty and could impede Dynamic Hearing's ability to verify royalty payments effectively.",

                "original_text": "If in any audit, the auditor finds an underpayment or an overpayment of fees due under this Agreement, the party who has received the overpayment or has underpaid will within 7 days repay the excess or pay the shortfall (as the case may be) to the other party.",
                "changed_text": "If an audit reveals discrepancies, the auditor's findings are non-binding and subject to further negotiation between the parties, potentially extending beyond 180 days. Repayment of any shortfall will be at the discretion of the party found to have underpaid, based on their financial capabilities and internal policies.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the binding nature of audit findings and introduces ambiguity regarding repayment obligations. Stipulating further negotiation potentially extending beyond 180 days and discretionary repayment based on financial capabilities directly contradicts standard business practices that mandate prompt rectification of audit-identified discrepancies. This alteration undermines the enforceability and financial integrity of the agreement.",

                "original_text": "5.1 Within thirty (30) days of the end of each payment quarter IntriCon must provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it or any Related Body Corporate. The statement must also include calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9. Any royalty due for payment by IntriCon to Dynamic Hearing is payable at the same time the statement is provided.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 IntriCon must provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it or any Related Body Corporate at IntriCon's discretion. The statement will include calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9, within 90 days of Dynamic Hearing's request. Any royalty due for payment by IntriCon to Dynamic Hearing is payable 180 days after Intricon Provides this report.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires IntriCon to provide a statement within 30 days of each payment quarter and pay royalties at the same time. This modification allows IntriCon to delay providing the statement until requested and extends the payment deadline to 180 days after the statement is provided. This creates a contradiction with standard accounting practices and potentially violates prompt payment laws, which require timely and predictable payment schedules. The modified text introduces uncertainty and delays the payment obligations, which would generally be deemed unreasonable under standard business practices.",

                "original_text": "6.2 IntriCon must make all such records available for inspection, copying and audit by an independent auditor appointed by Dynamic Hearing (and to which IntriCon has no reasonable objection) during ordinary business hours at any time during the Term and for a period of one year following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, provided that:\n\n       (a)    such inspection, copying or audit must only be made after at least one Business Day's written notice;\n\n       (b)    such audit must not unreasonably interfere with the day to day operations of IntriCon; and\n\n       (c)    such audit must be at Dynamic Hearing's expense unless the auditor finds an underpayment royalty due under this  Agreement in excess of 5% in which case IntriCon must reimburse Dynamic Hearing's reasonable cost of such audit;  and\n\n       (d)    Audits will be limited to one audit in any calendar year.",
                "changed_text": "6.2 IntriCon must make all such records available for inspection, copying and audit by an auditor of Dynamic Hearing's choice during ordinary business hours, but only upon 24 hours notice. All audits will be at IntriCon's expense, regardless of findings; IntriCon must facilitate such audits every quarter.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that IntriCon bears the audit cost only if the underpayment exceeds 5%, and it limits the number of audits to one per year. This modification dictates that IntriCon must cover all audit expenses regardless of the findings and undergo audits every quarter. This conflicts with principles of fair dealing and potentially creates an unreasonable financial burden on IntriCon. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific relationship, this could be considered an unfair contract term. Also, the one day notice can be regarded as unproportional.",

                "changed_text": "11.1 This Agreement may not be terminated by either party for any reason for the full five years from the commencement date.",
                "explanation": "This modification eliminates the two-year termination clause and the exception for non-payment, effectively locking both parties into the agreement for the entire five-year term, regardless of circumstances. This conflicts with fundamental contract law principles allowing for termination in cases of material breach or impossibility of performance. Such a restriction would likely be deemed unenforceable in many jurisdictions as it unreasonably restricts the parties' rights.",

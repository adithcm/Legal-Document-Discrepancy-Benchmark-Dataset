On the first Business Day of each month, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Contractor shall provide  the Company with a written invoice for the previous month's fees and expenses that are payable with respect to Notes issued up to the  last day of such month.. Such fees and expenses will be due and payable by the later of the fifteenth (15 ) day of every month or fifteen  (15) days after the date such invoice is received.",

On the first Business Day of each month, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Contractor shall provide the Company with a written invoice for the previous month's fees and expenses. Such fees and expenses will be due and payable ninety (90) days after the date such invoice is received.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within fifteen days of the invoice date, which aligns with standard business practices. The modified text extends the payment period to ninety days, which may be considered an unreasonably long delay that can significantly impact the contractor's cash flow and ability to meet its financial obligations. This contradicts the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and depending on the industry, can be seen as an unfair or deceptive practice, especially for small businesses.",

Unless otherwise requested by the Company, or unless otherwise required by Governmental Rules, the  Contractor shall retain, with respect to each Note, for a period of 24 months from the date the Note is fully paid, all records, files and documents related to each such Note. At  the end of such 24-month period, unless otherwise directed by the Company, all such items shall be transferred to the Company, or to a  third party as designated by the Company, at the Company's sole cost and expense.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the Contractor to retain records for 24 months. The modified text shortens this period to 6 months. This could violate regulations and statutes of limitations regarding financial record-keeping for investment products. Depending on the nature of the notes and relevant securities laws, a 6-month retention period may be insufficient to comply with legal and regulatory requirements for audits, investigations, or legal claims.",

The Company or the Contractor may terminate this Agreement at any time in whole or in part as more specifically provided below, and in such case, the Contractor will be paid fees incurred up to the date of such termination plus its expenses  accrued as of such date within 30 days of such termination. The Company will have the ability to terminate this Agreement by giving 60 days' prior  written notice to the Contractor. The Contractor will have the ability to terminate this Agreement by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the  Company.",
                "changed_text": "Section 8.02 Termination. The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, without cause, effective immediately upon written notice to the Contractor. In such case, the Contractor will only be paid fees incurred up to the date of such termination and no reimbursement of expenses. The Contractor will have the ability to terminate this Agreement by giving 180 days' prior written notice to the  Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides for a 60-day notice period for the Company to terminate and requires payment of fees and expenses accrued up to the termination date. The modified text allows the Company to terminate immediately without cause, eliminates expense reimbursement, and extends the Contractor's notice period to 180 days. The immediate termination without cause and denial of accrued expenses could be deemed unconscionable and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, particularly if the Contractor has made significant investments or incurred expenses in reliance on the agreement.",

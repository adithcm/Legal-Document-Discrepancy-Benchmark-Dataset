                "original_text": "The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.",
                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 10 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notice period required for the Remarketing Agent's resignation. A significantly shorter notice period might be deemed unreasonable and contradict common law principles requiring reasonable notice in contract terminations, potentially leading to disputes over adequate time for the Fund to find a replacement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law principles of reasonable notice for contract termination.",

                "original_text": "The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [●], a report of 6 portfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.",
                "changed_text": "The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within thirty (30) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [●], a report of 6 portfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such thirtieth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.",
                "explanation": "Delaying the delivery of the portfolio holdings report to 30 days may conflict with SEC regulations and standard practices requiring timely disclosure of fund information to investors. Such a delay could impede the Remarketing Agent's ability to accurately assess and market the VRRM-MFP Shares, violating regulatory expectations for transparency and investor protection.",

                "original_text": "Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons 10 shall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'as promptly as reasonably practicable' to 'within 180 days' introduces a fixed timeframe that might be considered unreasonable in certain situations. The longer timeframe, potentially conflicting with the principles of good faith and fair dealing, might prejudice the Indemnifying Persons' ability to investigate or defend claims effectively. This creates a contradiction as laws generally expect prompt notification to ensure fair opportunity to respond to legal claims.",

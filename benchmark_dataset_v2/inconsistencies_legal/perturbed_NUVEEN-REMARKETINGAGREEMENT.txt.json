                "original_text": "(a) The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.",
                "changed_text": "(a) The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 10 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the resignation notice period to 10 days creates an inconsistency, because such a short period may not allow the Fund adequate time to find a suitable replacement, potentially disrupting the remarketing process and harming the investors. This contradicts standard expectations for reasonable notice in financial contracts.",

                "original_text": "(b) The Fund may remove the Remarketing Agent with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving at least 60 days' prior written notice to the Remarketing Agent (and will provide prior notice also to the Calculation and Paying Agent, if any); provided, however, that no such removal shall become effective for an additional 30 days unless the Fund shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized securities dealer with expertise in remarketing variable rate securities as a successor Remarketing Agent for the VRRM-MFP Shares and the successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Fund, in form and substance satisfactory to the Fund, in which it shall have agreed to, among other duties, conduct remarketings in respect of VRRM-MFP Shares and determine the Dividend Rate on each Business Day for the VRRM-MFP Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Supplement.",
                "changed_text": "(b) The Fund may remove the Remarketing Agent with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares immediately without prior written notice to the Remarketing Agent or Calculation and Paying Agent.",
                "explanation": "Removing the notice requirement for the Fund to remove the Remarketing Agent introduces a legal contradiction. Generally, contracts require reasonable notice for termination to allow parties to prepare for the change. Immediate removal without notice could violate principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts, especially if the removal is arbitrary or causes significant harm.",

                "original_text": "(d) The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [‚óè], a report of portfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.",
                "changed_text": "(d) The Fund agrees to deliver to the Remarketing Agent a report of portfolio holdings of the Fund at its discretion, with no specified deadline or frequency. The Remarketing Agent may not provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares.",
                "explanation": "Eliminating the mandatory delivery of portfolio holdings reports and prohibiting the Remarketing Agent from sharing this information with investors creates a legal contradiction. Securities regulations often require transparency and timely disclosure of material information to investors. By restricting access to portfolio holdings, the agreement hinders the Remarketing Agent's ability to accurately market the VRRM-MFP Shares and potentially violates securities laws related to disclosure requirements.",

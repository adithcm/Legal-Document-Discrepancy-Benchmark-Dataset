                "explanation": "This change shortens the notice period required for the Servicer to resign. Many jurisdictions require longer notice periods for contract termination to allow for a smooth transition.",

Extending this to 15 days is likely insufficient and may violate common law principles of timely notification where potential financial risk is concerned.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common law duty to provide timely notification of material events; standards for timeliness vary by context but 15 days is likely too long where the event is bankruptcy.",

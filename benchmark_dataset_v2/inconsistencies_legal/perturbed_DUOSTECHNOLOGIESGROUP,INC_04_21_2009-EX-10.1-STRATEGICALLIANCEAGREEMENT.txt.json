                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each party shall account to the other on a monthly basis in respect of all sales and revenue received, and payments shall be made within 30 days of receipt of a properly valid invoice.",
                "changed_text": "Each party shall account to the other on a quarterly basis in respect of all sales and revenue received, and payments shall be made within 60 days of receipt of a properly valid invoice.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment terms to quarterly accounting and 60-day payment period introduces a contradiction because standard business practice and accounting regulations in the United States often require monthly reconciliation and shorter payment cycles, especially for services rendered. Extending the payment timeframe to 60 days may violate prompt payment laws in certain states or industries, which require faster payment for services or goods.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state prompt payment laws and standard accounting practices.",
                "location": "Section 4.4"

                "changed_text": "Each Party shall retain the financial records relating to all payments owed and/or paid under this Agreement for a period of three years from the date such payment obligation arose.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the record retention period to three years creates a conflict with IRS guidelines (and many state guidelines) that generally require businesses to keep financial records for at least six years for tax audit purposes. This change could lead to non-compliance with tax regulations and potential penalties.",
                "contradicted_law": "IRS record retention guidelines (generally 6 years).",
                "location": "Section 4.5"

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The confidentiality obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.",
                "changed_text": "The confidentiality obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of one year.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the survival period for confidentiality obligations to one year could be deemed unreasonable and insufficient to protect trade secrets or other sensitive business information, especially considering the nature of the strategic alliance. This contradicts common practices and legal precedents that often require longer confidentiality periods, potentially putting a party's confidential data at risk and unenforceable.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with trade secret protection laws, which require a 'reasonable' duration of confidentiality, and standard business practices regarding confidentiality.",

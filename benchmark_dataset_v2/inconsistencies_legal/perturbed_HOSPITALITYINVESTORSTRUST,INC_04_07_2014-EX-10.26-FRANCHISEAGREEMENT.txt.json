                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "10.1.1 At a minimum, by the fifteenth (15th) day of each month, you will submit to us the Operational Information for the previous month and reflecting the computation of the amounts then due under Section 8, in the form, manner and time frame we require.",
                "changed_text": "10.1.1 You will submit to us the Operational Information for the previous month and reflecting the computation of the amounts then due under Section 8 at our discretion. There is no guaranteed minimum or maximum frequency of submission.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because it allows the franchisor to demand reports at any undefined time, conflicting with generally accepted accounting principles and potentially violating state laws regarding fair business practices and transparency, as these laws usually imply reasonable and predictable schedules for financial reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violations of state-specific franchise laws regarding transparency and reporting requirements.",

                "changed_text": "14.1.1 You fail to pay us any sums due and owing to us or the Entities under this Agreement within the cure period set forth in the notice, which shall be five (5) days;",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to five days contradicts standard business practices and could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of good faith, particularly if state law implies a longer reasonable period or provides franchisee protections.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; potential violations of state-specific franchise laws regarding reasonable cure periods.",

                "original_text": "17.7 Notices. Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered in person, by prepaid overnight commercial delivery service, or by prepaid overnight mail, registered or certified, with return-receipt requested. Notices to us must be sent to 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, VA 22102, ATTN: General Counsel. We will send notices to your address set forth in the Addendum. If you want to change the name or address for notice to you, you must do so in writing, signed by you or your duly authorized representative, designating a single address for notice, which may not be a P.O. Box, in compliance with this Subsection. Notice will be deemed effective on the earlier of: 1) receipt or first refusal of delivery; 2) one (1) day after posting if sent via overnight commercial delivery service or overnight United States Mail; or 3) three (3) days after placement in the United States mail if overnight delivery is not available to the notice address.",

                "explanation": "By stating that notices are effective immediately upon sending and removing the requirement for written notice, this contradicts standard legal practice that demands documented proof of delivery and receipt, especially for critical contractual matters. The negation of Franchisor obligation to respond creates an imbalance, risking violation of good faith.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law requirements for proper notice; implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",

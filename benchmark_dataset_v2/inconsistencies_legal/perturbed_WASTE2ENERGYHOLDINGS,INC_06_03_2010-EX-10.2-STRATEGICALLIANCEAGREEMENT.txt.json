                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Party agrees to negotiate in good faith the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement and to use its reasonable endeavours to enter into said agreement within 1 DAY DN 20/5/2010 of the Commencement Date.",
                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees to negotiate in good faith the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement and to use its reasonable endeavours to enter into said agreement within 4 hours of the Commencement Date.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a contradiction because requiring a complex manufacturing agreement to be negotiated and entered into within 4 hours is commercially unreasonable and likely violates general contract law principles requiring sufficient time for negotiation and due diligence.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles of reasonableness and adequate time for negotiation.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party agrees that during the Term of this Agreement it shall not, without the prior written consent of the other Party, either on its own account or through its employees or agents or otherwise or on behalf of any other person, firm, company or other organisation and other than by general advertising, solicit, interfere with, procure or entice away (or, in each case, attempt so to do), either directly or indirectly, any employee or contractor of the other Party.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 6-month non-solicitation period after the termination of the agreement, this modification potentially conflicts with legal standards regarding reasonable restrictions on employee mobility and competition. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific nature of the business, a post-termination non-solicitation clause is often considered necessary to protect legitimate business interests; removing it may render the clause unenforceable or subject to legal challenge for inadequacy.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces inconsistencies by rendering hand delivery completely ineffective (deemed served 'never'). Additionally, setting the deemed service date for recorded delivery/registered post to 18 months, and registered airmail to ten years from posting is commercially unreasonable and contradicts established legal norms that require reasonable notification periods.",

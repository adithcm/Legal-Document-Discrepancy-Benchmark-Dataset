                "explanation": "This change extends the timeframe for transmitting subscription funds to five business days, contradicting SEC Rule 15c2-4, which requires prompt transmission or deposit of customer funds, generally interpreted as the next business day.",

                "explanation": "This modification extends the deadline for providing earnings statements to 150 days, conflicting with the SEC's requirement for timely financial reporting. While the exact requirement depends on the filing type, extending to 150 days is likely to violate reporting deadlines for many companies.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple inconsistencies. First, it extends the reporting deadline to 270 days, contradicting standard SEC filing timelines for annual reports (Form 10-K). Second, it allows for certification by 'internal accountants' instead of 'independent public accountants,' violating audit requirements for publicly traded companies. Finally, it replaces 'Regulation S-X' with 'the company's internal procedures,' which contravenes generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).",

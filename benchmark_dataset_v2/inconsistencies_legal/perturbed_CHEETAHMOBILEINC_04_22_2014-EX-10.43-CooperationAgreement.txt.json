In the event that Party A objects the payment from Party B, it shall propose within the first 5 working days in each month in writing, or it will be deemed as no objection. Party B shall review within three working days upon receipt of Party A's written objection and notify the results thereof to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "Party A provides the invoice of the share of revenues in the preceding month within the first 15 working days in each month in advance, Party B will pay the share of revenues to Party A prior to the 60th day of the following month (postponed in the event of public holidays) according to Article 4.1 hereof. In the event that Party A objects the payment from Party B, it shall propose within the first 20 working days in each month in writing, or it will be deemed as no objection. Party B shall review within fifteen working days upon receipt of Party A's written objection and notify the results thereof to Party A.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment period from within the 20th day of each month to the 60th day of the following month, which introduces inconsistencies with standard accounting and business practices that require timely payments. Also, the response deadline to an objection is extended from 3 to 15 working days, thus creating inconsistencies and legal issues.",

If the breach party continue to carry on the breaching conduct or does not perform its obligations, the non- breaching party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in addition to the compensation for the breach.",

If the breach party continues to carry on the breaching conduct or does not perform its obligations, the non- breaching party shall only have the right to seek mediation.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the period for rectifying a breach and paying losses from 10 days to 365 days, thus introducing inconsistencies with industry standards.

                "original_text": "12.2 Any portions of this Agreement necessary to resolve or cash out imbalances under this Agreement as required by the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's Tariff shall survive the other parts of this Agreement until such time as such balancing has been accomplished; provided, however, that Transporter notifies Shipper of such imbalance not later than twelve months after the termination of this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The modification extends the notification period for imbalances to two years, potentially conflicting with statutes of limitations or regulatory requirements regarding the resolution of financial discrepancies in Kentucky. Kentucky's statute of limitations for breach of contract is generally five years, but specific regulations governing gas transportation may impose shorter deadlines for resolving imbalances. A two-year notification period might unduly delay the resolution process and disadvantage the Shipper by making it more difficult to gather evidence or contest the imbalance.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the method of delivering notices to 'carrier pigeon'. This creates an inconsistency in the notice clause. The Kentucky Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) and general contract law require commercially reasonable methods of communication. Carrier pigeons do not meet standards for reliability or documentation in modern business practices, making this modification legally suspect.",

                "explanation": "This modification allows immediate termination of the agreement without any prior notice to the shipper for any failure to pay, even a small portion of the bill. This contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires reasonable notice and an opportunity to cure a breach before termination, especially in long-term contracts. Kentucky law recognizes the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, and summary termination for a minor payment discrepancy could be deemed a breach of this covenant.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby agree to the joint filing with each of the Reporting Persons (as such term is defined in the Schedule 13D referred to below) on behalf of each of them of a statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) with respect to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share of Macy's, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and that this agreement may be included as an exhibit to such joint filing.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned agree that joint filing is optional. No party is obligated to participate in joint filings, and each may file independently at their sole discretion, irrespective of shared ownership or control over Macy's, Inc. shares. Any statement on Schedule 13D (including amendments thereto and statements on Schedule 13G) may be filed at the convenience of each party.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the SEC's requirement for joint filings when parties act as a group with respect to securities ownership. By stating joint filing is optional, the agreement violates the mandatory reporting obligations under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13d-1(k)(1) thereunder. The added provision purports to allow independent filings even when group status exists, undermining the transparency and disclosure purposes of the Act.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall strive to file amendments in a reasonable timeframe. While each party confirms the accuracy of their individual information, they bear no liability for inaccuracies or omissions made by other parties, even if known or reasonably knowable. No due diligence is required concerning information provided by other parties for joint filings.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the responsibility of each party regarding the accuracy of information filed jointly. Under securities law, parties making joint filings have a duty to ensure the accuracy of the entire filing, not just their individual contributions. Reducing this responsibility contradicts the SEC's expectations for due diligence and accuracy in disclosures, and potentially violates anti-fraud provisions if a party knowingly relies on inaccurate information from another party. The phrase 'strive to file amendments in a reasonable timeframe' is also dangerously vague and unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "Subject to the individual preferences of each signatory, compliance with Rule 13d-1(k)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding joint filings is not mandatory. The parties will operate in good faith but are not legally bound to adhere strictly to the filing deadlines and information accuracy requirements. Deviation from prescribed rules is acceptable if it is deemed beneficial to the overall investment strategy, as determined at the sole discretion of each party involved.",
                "explanation": "This alteration significantly weakens the binding nature of the agreement regarding compliance with securities law. It introduces ambiguity by stating that compliance is 'subject to the individual preferences' and 'not mandatory,' thereby allowing parties to disregard established regulations. This directly conflicts with the mandatory reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and could lead to legal repercussions for non-compliance.",

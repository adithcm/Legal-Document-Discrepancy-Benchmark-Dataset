Without limiting the next to last sentence of Section 3.5, Microgenics shall notify Achaogen promptly of any notification or information received from a Regulatory Authority, that: (i) would reasonably be expected to impair the integrity or reputation of Plazomicin or the Assay; (ii) raises any material concerns regarding the safety or efficacy of Plazomicin or the Assay; (iii) indicates or suggests a potential material liability of either Party to Third Parties in connection with Plazomicin or the Assay; (iv) is reasonably likely to lead to a recall or market withdrawal with respect to Plazomicin or the Assay; or (v) [***].",

                "explanation": "The change extends the initial notification period for regulatory findings to 30 business days, creating potential non-compliance with regulations requiring prompt reporting of significant issues. Additionally, allowing Microgenics to provide information 'at its convenience' introduces ambiguity that could contravene regulatory timelines for information disclosure. Then, change the time frame that is lower to 10 days.",

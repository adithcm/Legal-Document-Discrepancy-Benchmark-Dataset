No later than ninety (90) calendar days from the date of execution of this Agreement (the \"New Director B Appointment Deadline\"), the Company shall take the necessary steps to cause the Board to appoint one of the candidates set forth on Exhibit A (as the same may be supplemented or otherwise amended from time to time by the mutual constent of the Company and the Investor Group, the \"Director Candidate Pool\") as New Director B with a term on the Board expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.",

                "explanation": "Delaying the deadline for appointing New Director B could be considered an unreasonable delay, particularly if the delay impedes the Investor Group's ability to influence board decisions.

Upon acceptance of a replacement director candidate by both the Company and the Investor Group, the Board shall take such actions as to appoint such replacement director candidate to the Board no later than ten (10) business days after both parties have confirmed in writing that they have mutually agreed upon such candidate.",

                "explanation": "The extended timelines for candidate determination, interviews, and appointment provide opportunities for undue delays and interference in the board appointment process, undermining the intent of ensuring timely and effective board composition.

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.2 \"Interim Period\" means a period of four (4) years commencing from the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 \"Interim Period\" means a period of ten (10) years commencing from the Effective Date of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract sets an 'Interim Period' of four years. Changing this to ten years may create inconsistencies if the agreement involves trademark licensing or other intellectual property rights where a shorter, legally defined period (if such a legal definition exists for this kind of agreement) is expected or typical for such arrangements, or if it affects amortization of intellectual property which tax laws often limit to under 10 years. By extending this period, the contract potentially contradicts standard business and legal expectations. Also, extending this by more than five years might trigger regulatory reviews depending on the industry.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential conflicts with standard intellectual property amortization schedules under tax law and general principles of reasonable business practice.",

                "original_text": "HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "HERC shall provide for two (2) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within sixty (60) days after the execution of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the insurance modification notice to two days may violate state laws (e.g., in Florida, where THC is located) that require insurers to provide a minimum of 10-20 days' notice for policy changes. Conversely, extending the deadline to furnish certificates of insurance to 60 days is unreasonable, potentially violating standard business practices and increasing risk exposure for THC and HSI. This also contradicts good faith and fair dealing principles under contract law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state insurance regulations regarding cancellation/modification notice periods (e.g., Florida Statutes regarding insurance cancellation) and principles of good faith in contract performance.",

                "original_text": "If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate immediately without notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten days could be considered unreasonably short, potentially violating principles of fairness and good faith, especially if the breach involves complex operational or financial issues. Moreover, removing the 'notice of termination' requirement for incurable breaches can violate due process rights and contractual expectations that require notification, irrespective of the breach's nature. This is against general contract law practices.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of good faith and fair dealing principles under contract law and possible due process concerns due to lack of notice.",

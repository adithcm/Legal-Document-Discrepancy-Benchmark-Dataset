                "explanation": "The original text defines the \"Interim Period\" as four years. Changing this to ten years significantly extends the duration of trademark licenses and restrictions. While not inherently illegal, such an extended period, especially in the context of trademark law, could be deemed unreasonable restraint of trade in certain jurisdictions or under specific circumstances (depending on the specific trademarks involved and their market impact). Trademark agreements and co-existence agreements are often scrutinized for their duration and potential anti-competitive effects under both state and federal antitrust laws.",

HERC shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, obtain and maintain at its own cost and expense, from a qualified AAA-rated insurance company, a standard liability insurance and business interruption policy along with advertising injury protection, all of which must be acceptable to THC and HSI, and which must name THC and HSI as additional insureds. Such policy shall provide, in addition to other protection, protection against any and all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of any act, omission, negligence or otherwise giving rise to a third party claim. The amount of coverage shall be a minimum of three million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit, with no deductible amount for each single occurrence for bodily injury and/or property damage. HERC shall provide for ten (10) days notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement. In no event shall HERC perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",

The specifics of such policy, including coverage amounts and deductible amounts, shall be at HERC's sole discretion. HERC shall provide one (1) day notice to THC and HSI in the event of any modification, cancellation or termination. HERC agrees to furnish THC and HSI Certificates of Insurance evidencing same within ninety (90) days after the execution of this Agreement. HERC may perform or promote the carry out the activities contemplated under this Agreement or the Trademark, Trade Name, Domain and Related Rights License Agreement prior to receipt by THC and HSI of evidence of insurance.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the insurance clause to give HERC sole discretion over policy specifics and reducing the notice period for modification/cancellation to one day creates potential liability issues.  This conflicts with industry standards and reasonable business practices, as well as fiduciary duties to protect the interests of all parties named on the insurance.  Extending the deadline to furnish insurance certificates to 90 days and allowing activities before providing proof of coverage is also an issue because it removes standard insurance protection, it also is inconsistent with reasonable business practices that would be in place. All these things are inconsistent and could lead to legal challenges based on negligence or breach of contract.",

In the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements exhibited hereto, THC or HSI may notify HERC of such material breach and terminate this Agreement upon written notice. If HERC has not cured any such breach within thirty (30) days after HERC receives such notice, this Agreement shall automatically terminate without further notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the nature of the breach is such that it cannot be cured, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon notice of termination by THC or HSI to HERC (without any opportunity to cure the breach).",

                "explanation": "Removing the requirement for written notice and opportunity to cure, and allowing immediate termination for *any* breach, regardless of materiality, is likely unenforceable in many jurisdictions.  Courts often require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach, particularly for non-material breaches. A clause allowing termination for any breach, no matter how minor, is considered an unreasonable penalty and could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potential for unconscionability argument, possible violation of state contract law requirements for reasonable termination clauses.",

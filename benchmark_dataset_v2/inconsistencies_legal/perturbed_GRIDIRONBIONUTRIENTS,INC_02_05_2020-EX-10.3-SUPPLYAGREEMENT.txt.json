                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "D. Payment. Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment upon execution of this agreement.",
                "changed_text": "D. Payment. Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to a transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product, the Buyer will remit payment within 180 days of execution of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires immediate payment upon execution. The modified contract allows for payment up to 180 days after execution, which could violate prompt payment laws depending on the specific industry and jurisdiction (Colorado). Colorado Revised Statutes Section 8-4-101 et seq. governs payment of wages and potentially other commercial transactions, which could be contravened by unduly delayed payment terms.",

All notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered by email or personal delivery on the date sent; or if my facsimile on the date sent; or if by certified US mail on the third business day following such mailing; or if by overnight courier, on the next business day.",
                "changed_text": "4. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered exclusively via carrier pigeon, with receipt conclusively presumed upon dispatch.",
                "explanation": "This change mandates that all notices must be delivered by carrier pigeon, which is not a commercially reasonable or legally acceptable method of providing notice. This creates non-compliance with general contract law principles of reasonable notification and conflicts with electronic transaction laws (UETA), which would recognize emails as valid notifications.",

                "changed_text": "B. Termination. Neither Party may terminate this Agreement under any circumstances, regardless of breach or impossibility of performance.",
                "explanation": "The original allows termination before delivery. This change eliminates the right to terminate, even for breach or impossibility, violating fundamental contract law principles. Courts generally recognize the right to terminate a contract for material breach or impossibility of performance. Completely restricting termination could be deemed an unconscionable provision.",

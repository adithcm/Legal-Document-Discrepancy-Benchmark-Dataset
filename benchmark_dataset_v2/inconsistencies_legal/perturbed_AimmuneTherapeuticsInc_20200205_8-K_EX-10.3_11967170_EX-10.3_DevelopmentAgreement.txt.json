                "original_text": "The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).",
                "changed_text": "The Breaching Party shall have fifteen (15) days (seven (7) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period (seven (7) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within five (5) days of the end of such fifteen (15) day period (seven (7) day period for non-payment).",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the cure period for a material breach and non-payment, potentially violating legal standards that require a reasonable opportunity to cure before contract termination. Courts often require a reasonable timeframe, and such a short timeframe might be deemed unreasonable.",

The audit shall be limited to pertinent records kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees for any year ending not more than [***] ([***]) months prior to the date of the written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Xencor shall have the right, upon two (2) days' prior written notice to Aimmune, to cause an independent, uncertified local accounting firm chosen solely by Xencor to audit such records at any time, including outside of normal business hours, to confirm the number of Product units sold, the gross sales and Net Sales of Product, the royalties payable, the method used to calculate the royalties payable, and the exchange rates used in accordance with Section 8.2. The audit shall include all records, regardless of relevance, kept by Aimmune and its Affiliates and Sublicensees from the inception of this agreement.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to 90 days is unreasonable for trade secrets and proprietary information, conflicting with standard practice and legal protections for intellectual property.

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies a 1-business-day email response time for non-critical issues and a 99% uptime guarantee. Changing this to 7 business days and 90% uptime significantly degrades the service level, which may be considered commercially unreasonable and misrepresentative, violating consumer protection laws. Most jurisdictions in United States have consumer laws protecting consumer rights in service based contracts.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the overage fee from $20 to $100 per GB of bandwidth may be considered unconscionable or predatory in many jurisdictions, especially if not clearly disclosed and easily understood by the customer. This constitutes a violation of fair trade practices.",

                "changed_text": "This includes backups of the website and database at the hosting company's discretion.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'regular off-site backups' to 'backups at the hosting company's discretion', the contract removes a clear obligation for off-site data protection. In many jurisdictions, data protection laws and industry best practices require reliable and geographically separate backups. Removing the guarantee of regular off-site backups may lead to significant data loss risks and potential legal liabilities if a disaster occurs and data recovery fails.",

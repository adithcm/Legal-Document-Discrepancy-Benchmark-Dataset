                "changed_text": "Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate equal to twenty-five (25%) percent per annum.",
                "explanation": "New York usury laws limit the permissible interest rate on debts. Charging 25% per annum may violate these laws if it exceeds the legal limit for the type of debt involved, creating a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to two days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering the complexity of potential breaches. This could conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under New York law, which requires parties to act reasonably in exercising their contractual rights.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for examination of records to one business day, and the time allowed to complete the exam to one week is unreasonable. This might be considered an impediment to Diplomat's right to audit the books, potentially conflicting with principles of good faith and fair dealing, and preventing proper oversight.",

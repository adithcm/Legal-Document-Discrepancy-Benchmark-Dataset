Changing this to 60 business days introduces a delay that may conflict with standard accounting practices and potentially violate regulations requiring timely financial reporting.

The modified version removes the requirement for the certificate entirely and shortens the response time to 5 days. This is contradictory because, under US tax laws and international tax treaties, the withholding party often has a legal obligation to provide documentation of withholding. Furthermore, shortening the time frame to 5 days is unreasonable because this is too short for the other party to determine if the tax amounts are correct.",

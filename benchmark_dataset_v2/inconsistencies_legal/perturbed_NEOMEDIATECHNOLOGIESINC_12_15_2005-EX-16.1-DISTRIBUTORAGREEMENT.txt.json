                "original_text": "DISTRIBUTOR shall inspect the Products within 48 hours upon delivery. In case of discrepancy found in Products delivered, DISTRIBUTOR shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing, detailing all the discrepancies within 48 hours after delivery. PPG SHANGHAI will not accept any claims for discrepancy in delivery beyond the 48 hours period. If Products are found damaged upon delivery, DISTRIBUTOR or its customers who directly receive the delivery shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing within 48 hours.",
                "changed_text": "DISTRIBUTOR shall inspect the Products within 12 hours upon delivery. In case of discrepancy found in Products delivered, DISTRIBUTOR shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing, detailing all the discrepancies within 12 hours after delivery. PPG SHANGHAI will not accept any claims for discrepancy in delivery beyond the 12 hours period. If Products are found damaged upon delivery, DISTRIBUTOR or its customers who directly receive the delivery shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing within 12 hours.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the inspection and reporting period for discrepancies and damages to 12 hours is unreasonable and likely contradicts general principles of contract law, which require a reasonable time for inspection and reporting. The original 48 hours is also relatively short, but making it 12 hours could be seen as exploitative and unconscionable.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law regarding 'reasonable time' for inspection and acceptance of goods. Article 157 of the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China requires the buyer to inspect goods within a reasonable period after delivery.",

                "changed_text": "If either party be in default with respect to any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, DISTRIBUTOR's failure to pay any invoice of PPG SHANGHAI in accordance with its terms, and if it fails to correct such default or failure within three (3) business days following written notice thereof from the other, the party serving such notice may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, defer further performance hereunder until such default be remedied or terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other, and the same shall terminate immediately upon the giving of such notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for defaults, especially payment defaults, to just three business days may be deemed unreasonably short under Chinese contract law, especially considering potential delays in international money transfers or unforeseen circumstances affecting payment processing. A shorter period puts undue pressure on the distributor and can be seen as unfair.",

The parties shall agree on the terms and conditions of the renewal, and enter into a new agreement within thirty (30) days from the expiry of this Agreement. During this thirty (30) days period, both parties shall continue to perform their respective obligation under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframes for both expressing intention to renew and finalizing the new agreement creates time constraints that might be viewed as unreasonable. This could be particularly problematic in international business relationships, where communication and negotiation might require more time. Setting the deadline for both at 15 and 30 days respectively creates potential for legal challenges based on 'reasonableness'.",

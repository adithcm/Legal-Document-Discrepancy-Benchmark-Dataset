                "original_text": "Payments shall be made 15 days from the end of each quarter. Smith's net payment after any such charges or deductions shall equal the amount set forth above. Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, or (ii) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "Payments shall be made 90 days from the end of each quarter. Smith's net payment after any such charges or deductions shall equal the amount set forth above. Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) twenty percent (20%) per month, or (ii) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is greater.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies payment 15 days after the end of each quarter and a default interest rate of 1.5% per month. I've changed it to 90 days after the end of each quarter, which is an unreasonably long delay for payment, potentially violating prompt payment laws depending on the context, and increased the interest rate to 20% per month. An interest rate of 20% per month (240% annually) may violate usury laws, which set legal limits on interest rates to prevent predatory lending.",

                "explanation": "The contract provides for Smith engaging an independent accounting firm with ten (10) working days written notice. The edit changes it to one (1) working day written notice, which creates non-compliance with regulatory standards, because this may be unreasonably short notice to prepare for a comprehensive audit, making it difficult for the licensee to gather necessary documents and personnel and potentially breaching good faith and fair dealing principles.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with typical contract law standards, as 60 days is a more standard and reasonable notice period. Shortening it to 30 days may be deemed insufficient, particularly if the reseller has made significant investments based on the agreement. While not directly violating a statute, it weakens the enforceability based on reasonableness and fairness, potentially leading to legal challenges under general contract principles. It could be argued that 30 days is not enough time to wind down operations or find a replacement, especially if the reseller has a substantial customer base.",

                "explanation": "This change extends the payment period for referral fees. While not a direct violation of a specific law, extending payment terms can create issues under state prompt payment laws, particularly if those laws mandate shorter payment periods for subcontractors or similar relationships. It might also violate general business practices that promotes payment within a reasonable time and it may be deemed unconscionable.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from 15 to 5 business days is potentially problematic. While parties can generally agree on cure periods, extremely short periods can be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable. This is especially true if the breach involves complex issues requiring more time to resolve. A five-day cure period might be challenged as insufficient, violating principles of good faith and fair dealing, and potentially conflicting with state laws requiring reasonable opportunity to cure breaches, leading to unenforceability of the termination clause. Certain complex breaches will undoubtedly require more than 5 days to cure, therefore this clause is unreasonable. ",

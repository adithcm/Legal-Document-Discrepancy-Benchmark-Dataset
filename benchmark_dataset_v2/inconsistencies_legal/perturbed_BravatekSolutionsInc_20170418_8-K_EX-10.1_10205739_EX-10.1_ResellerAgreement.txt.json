                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a sixty (60) written notice.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate this agreement for non-cause with a ten (10) day written notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a sixty-day written notice for termination without cause. Modifying it to a ten-day notice creates a conflict with standard contract law principles that typically require a reasonable notice period. Depending on the specific jurisdiction and the nature of the reseller agreement, ten days may be deemed unreasonably short, especially considering the investments and dependencies built over the term of the agreement. This could lead to legal challenges based on insufficient notice.",

                "changed_text": "Referral Fees will be paid within ninety (90) days of the collection of receivables from the Registered Referral.",
                "explanation": "The modification changes the payment terms for referral fees from thirty days to ninety days after the collection of receivables. While seemingly innocuous, delayed payment terms can run afoul of prompt payment laws that exist in many states. These laws mandate timely payment for goods and services, and extending the payment period to ninety days could be viewed as an unreasonable delay, especially for small businesses or independent contractors acting as resellers. The fairness of this extended delay is also questionable.",

                "changed_text": "For a Registered Opportunity where the customer purchases from Reseller, payment will be made by Reseller to Company within 30 days of receipt of payment (paid when paid).",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment timeline from 5 days to 30 days introduces potential legal conflicts. While no specific law is directly contradicted, altering the original agreement significantly impacts the promptness of payments. This delay affects the Company's cash flow and contradicts the initial agreement's intent for rapid compensation. This deviation could breach the original contract terms, potentially creating a cause for legal disputes due to the altered payment schedule.",

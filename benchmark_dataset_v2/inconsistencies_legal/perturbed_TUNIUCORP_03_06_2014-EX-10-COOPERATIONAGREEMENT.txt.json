                "original_text": "4.2 The Service Fee of the last quarter shall be paid prior to the seventh business day following the commencement of the next quarter. Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A seven business days in advance.",

Such Service Fee shall be paid to the bank account designated by Party B in writing. If Party B intends to change its bank account, it shall send a written notice to Party A one business day in advance.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the payment timeframe to one business day contradicts standard business practices and potentially Chinese labor laws concerning payment deadlines, which usually require more reasonable timeframes for processing payments. Similarly, requiring only one day's notice for bank account changes is insufficient and unreasonable, potentially causing payment delays and legal disputes.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Chinese labor laws regarding reasonable payment processing times and general principles of contract law requiring reasonable notice periods.",

If the performance of this Agreement by one Party or the Parties according to provisions agreed hereunder is directly affected by the force majeure event, the affected Party shall immediately notify the other Party or its attorney-in-fact of the situation of the force majeure event, and shall, within fifteen (15) days, provide the detailed information of the force majeure event or the reason for non-performance or partial performance or delay of performance of this Agreement as well as valid evidence thereof (which shall be issued by the notarization authority at the place where the force majeure event occurs).",

If the performance of this Agreement by one Party or the Parties according to provisions agreed hereunder is directly affected by the force majeure event, the affected Party shall immediately notify the other Party or its attorney-in-fact of the situation of the force majeure event, and shall, within two (2) months, provide the detailed information of the force majeure event or the reason for non-performance or partial performance or delay of performance of this Agreement as well as valid evidence thereof (which shall be issued by the notarization authority at the place where the force majeure event occurs).",
                "explanation": "Extending the notification period for a force majeure event to two months contradicts standard practices and may violate principles requiring timely notification in contract law. Delays in providing detailed information about the force majeure event and its impact could significantly harm the other party's ability to mitigate damages or adjust their business strategies.",

The notice, communication or letter sent under this Agreement shall be deemed as effectively received on the thirtieth (30) day after sending to the mail service.",
                "explanation": "Mandating only standard mail for official notices and setting a 30-day receipt timeframe is unreasonable and conflicts with modern business practices requiring faster communication. This extended period could result in critical delays, breaches of contract due to missed deadlines, and significant financial losses. In the modern digital business landscape, courier and electronic methods are commonly used for faster communication. Making standard mail the only valid method of communication is extremely unusual.",

                "changed_text": "Such invoice must be paid by the customer within 60 days of the date on which the invoice is issued.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment term to 60 days could violate prompt payment laws in some jurisdictions, particularly if the standard payment term is shorter or if specific regulations mandate faster payment for certain goods or services. Spain's Law 3/2004 sets a 30-day payment term unless otherwise agreed and not grossly unfair to the creditor.",
                "contradicted_law": "Spain's Law 3/2004, which generally requires payments to be made within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and not grossly unfair to the creditor.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year could be insufficient to protect trade secrets, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws. While the agreement is governed by Spanish law, a one-year period might be deemed unreasonably short for the protection of certain types of sensitive commercial information, depending on the industry and the nature of the information.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the conflict resolution period to ten days could be considered unreasonably short, hindering effective negotiation and potentially forcing premature escalation to litigation. This timeframe might conflict with principles of good faith negotiation and dispute resolution practices, especially given the complexities of international commercial disputes.",

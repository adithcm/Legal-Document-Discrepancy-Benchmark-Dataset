                "original_text": "Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.",
                "changed_text": "Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within 1 hour of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the confirmation/rejection timeframe for purchase orders to 1 hour, which may be unreasonably short, especially for complex orders or those requiring internal approvals. This could be deemed an unfair or unconscionable practice under general contract law principles, particularly if the Supplier is a smaller entity with less administrative capacity than the Buyer. This might create a scenario where the supplier is forced to accept disadvantageous terms due to the impracticality of the confirmation window.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles regarding unconscionability and fairness in contract terms. Depending on the jurisdiction, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) may also be relevant regarding reasonable timeframes for acceptance or rejection of offers.",

If the deficiency cannot be corrected within [***], unless otherwise agreed, then PNC shall have the right to terminate any Purchase Orders then outstanding, along with any Master Purchase Commitment related thereto.",
                "changed_text": "If correction of the deficiency cannot be affected within 2 hours of such notice, then Supplier shall promptly notify PNC with its plan to correct the deficiency including an estimated schedule. If the deficiency cannot be corrected within 24 hours, unless otherwise agreed, then PNC shall have the right to terminate any Purchase Orders then outstanding, along with any Master Purchase Commitment related thereto.",
                "explanation": "This change drastically reduces the timeframe allowed for the Supplier to correct deficiencies to 2 hours for initial notification and 24 hours for complete correction. Such a short timeframe is unrealistic for many types of deficiencies, especially those involving complex food safety issues or requiring significant equipment repairs. This could be considered commercially unreasonable and potentially violate the Supplier's right to cure a breach, depending on the specifics of the applicable state law. By providing unreasonably short timeframes, the contract could be interpreted as acting in bad faith.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the non-renewal notification period from 12 months to 1 month is commercially unreasonable. For a supply agreement of this magnitude, 1 monthsâ€™ notice is inadequate to allow the other party to find a replacement supplier or customer, potentially causing significant business disruption and financial harm. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, this could be viewed as an unconscionable or bad-faith contract term. This lack of time may also violate laws requiring longer notification periods for major contracts. A 1-month notification does not give the other party sufficient time to make arrangements to protect their business interests.",

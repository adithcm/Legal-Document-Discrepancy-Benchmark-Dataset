                "original_text": "2.1  LICENSOR  shall  make  a  first  delivery  of Content to plan_b within           14  days  after the signing of this Agreement unless separately agreed           between  the  Parties.",

                "explanation": "The original contract stipulates content delivery within 14 days. Changing this to 60 days introduces a potential inconsistency. While not explicitly illegal, unreasonably delaying initial delivery can be seen as a breach of contract, especially if industry standards or implied terms suggest a faster turnaround. This delay could impact plan_b's ability to meet its obligations and cause damages.",

Such  report  shall  be  provided  to LICENSOR in electronic           format  within  6  weeks  of  the  end  of  a  quarter.",

Such  report  shall  be  provided  to LICENSOR in electronic           format  within  12  weeks  of  the  end  of  a  quarter.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the reporting timeframe from 6 weeks to 12 weeks could be seen as unreasonable, especially if prompt reporting is crucial for revenue sharing and performance monitoring. It might hinder LICENSOR's ability to identify potential issues or inaccuracies in a timely manner, potentially leading to disputes or financial losses.",

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies payment terms as 30 days after receipt of invoice. Delaying payment to 90 days after invoice receipt significantly alters the financial terms and potentially violates laws related to prompt payment, depending on jurisdiction and industry standards. Many jurisdictions have laws requiring payments to be made within a reasonable time, and 90 days may exceed that threshold.",

                "original_text": "3.3 plan_b shall provide LICENSOR with a detailed written record, which includes the number of End User downloads and each distribution channel. Such report shall be provided to LICENSOR in electronic format within 6 weeks of the end of a quarter.",

                "explanation": "Delaying the reporting period to 16 weeks after the end of the quarter could be considered an unreasonably long delay, especially considering the importance of timely revenue reporting. This could violate general principles of good faith and fair dealing implied in contracts governed by US law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under United States contract law.",

The Initial Term shall automatically be extended for an additional period of half a year unless either party provides the other party with written notification of termination of the letter Agreement at least 10 days prior to end of such period.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for termination to 10 days before the end of the term is unreasonable and may not provide sufficient time for the other party to prepare for the termination.

                "explanation": "Extending payment terms to 90 days after receipt of invoice may be considered predatory and violate federal Prompt Payment Act, which requires federal agencies to pay vendors within 30 days of receiving an invoice.

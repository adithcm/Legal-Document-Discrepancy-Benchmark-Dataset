The modified text changes these periods to one business day and 15 business days respectively, which is unduly restrictive and potentially violates legal standards that require reasonable opportunity to cure breaches of contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires a six-month notice for non-renewal, while the modified text reduces this to one month.

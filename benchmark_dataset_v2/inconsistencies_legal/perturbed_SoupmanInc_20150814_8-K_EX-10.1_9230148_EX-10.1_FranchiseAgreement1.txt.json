                "original_text": "You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 s t ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.",
                "changed_text": "You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter, together with a summary of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a quarterly report, not later than the last day of the following quarter, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar quarter. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a quarterly report, in such form and including minimal detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar quarter. Any report received by us within 90 days of the due date will not be deemed overdue.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires submission of Unit Franchise Agreements within ten (10) days, and monthly reports by the first day of each month, and contains more specific details on penalties for not providing the revenue reports described in Section 4.6 below. These deadlines are modified to thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter. The changes weaken the requirements for reporting, conflicting with best practices for transparency and accountability. They create non-compliance because the modifications do not conform to regulatory standards for detailed reporting in a timely manner.",

Each audited financial statement shall include a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement. If you own, directly or beneficially, a controlling financial interest in any other business, the financial statements required to be submitted by you must reflect your financial condition and your other business operations on a consolidated basis. You understand and acknowledge that the Federal Trade Commission's disclosure requirements for franchising (16 CFR Part 436) require you to include audited financial statements each year after your fiscal year end. You further understand and acknowledge that, as with your initial Unit Franchise Disclosure Document, all annual updates to your Unit Franchise Disclosure Document shall be submitted to us or our counsel for review within one hundred twenty (120) days after each fiscal year end.",

Each financial statement shall include only a profit and loss statement. If you own, directly or beneficially, a controlling financial interest in any other business, the financial statements required to be submitted by you do not need to reflect your other business operations on a consolidated basis. You understand and acknowledge that the Federal Trade Commission's disclosure requirements for franchising (16 CFR Part 436) require you to include audited financial statements each year after your fiscal year end, which are not mandatory as part of this agreement. All annual updates to your Unit Franchise Disclosure Document shall be submitted to us or our counsel for review within two hundred seventy (270) days after each fiscal year end.",
                "explanation": "The initial contract requires the franchisee to submit a complete, audited financial statement within one hundred twenty (120) days of the fiscal year end. The financial statement must be audited, include a balance sheet and profit and loss statement, and, must consolidate all financial statements if the franchisee owns other businesses. The modification extends the submission deadline to two hundred seventy (270) days, only requires a profit and loss statement, and requires an internal accountant instead of a certified public accountant. The altered terms may be non-compliant with regulations concerning financial transparency and disclosure.",

Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, however, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions of this Section 12, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent shall transfer the decedent's interest to another party approved by us within twelve (12) months, which disposition shall be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. We may, at our option, assume management and control of the Franchised Business during such twelve (12) month period and shall be paid a reasonable monthly management fee for our services as determined by us. If the interest is not disposed of within such period, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2.4 of this Agreement.",

The altered text reduces the time to six (6) months, removes the transfer fee waiver, and increases the likelihood of immediate termination, which is in non-compliance because the modifications do not conform to regulatory standards for fair and reasonable transfer terms.",

                "original_text": "AT&T shall pay Vendor no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such monthly payment request for Structured Payments. AT&T shall pay, or provide a written notice of any good faith dispute to, Vendor no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of an invoice for Maintenance Fees. Any dispute of an invoice for Maintenance Fees shall be made by AT&T in good faith and shall set forth in writing a detailed description of the disputed amounts and the reason for such dispute. Notwithstanding any good faith dispute, AT&T shall pay all undisputed amounts in full to Vendor no later than the due date for such invoice. Invoices received by AT&T more than one (1) year after the Delivery of Material and Deliverables or the provision of Services are untimely and AT&T has no obligation to pay such invoices.",
                "changed_text": "AT&T shall pay Vendor no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of such monthly payment request for Structured Payments. AT&T shall pay, or provide a written notice of any good faith dispute to, Vendor no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt of an invoice for Maintenance Fees. Any dispute of an invoice for Maintenance Fees needs not be made by AT&T in good faith nor setting forth in writing a detailed description of the disputed amounts. Notwithstanding any dispute, AT&T shall pay all amounts in full to Vendor at AT&T's discretion. Invoices received by AT&T more than two (2) years after the Delivery of Material and Deliverables or the provision of Services are untimely and AT&T has no obligation to pay such invoices.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payments be made within 60 or 90 days. The modified text increases this to 90 and 120 days respectively. Additionally, it removes the requirement for 'good faith' disputes and allows payment at AT&T's discretion. Finally, it modifies the period after which invoices are considered untimely from one year to two years, potentially conflicting with state Prompt Payment laws.",
                "contradicted_law": "Prompt Payment laws in various states (e.g., California Business and Professions Code ยง 7159.5) mandate specific payment deadlines for contractors and subcontractors, often shorter than 90 or 120 days. Removing the 'good faith' requirement violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.",

Vendor provides no warranty for Material with respect to any AT&T Provided Equipment.

                "explanation": "Reducing the warranty period to 30 days could be seen as unconscionable depending on the type of material and service provided. It shifts a disproportionate amount of risk onto AT&T, especially if the typical lifespan or reasonable expectation of the materials and workmanship far exceeds 30 days.",

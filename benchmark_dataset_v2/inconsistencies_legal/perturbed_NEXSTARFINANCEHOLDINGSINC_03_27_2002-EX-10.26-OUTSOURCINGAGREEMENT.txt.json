                "original_text": "Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that \"BCF\" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month.",
                "changed_text": "Within one hundred eighty (180) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that \"BCF\" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment timeframe from 75 days to 180 days could potentially violate prompt payment laws in some states, including Illinois, where the station is located. These laws often require payment within a much shorter timeframe to protect the financial interests of the payee. For example, the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act requires prompt payment of final compensation.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the deadline for delivering the BCF report from 30 days to 90 days may conflict with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or industry standards. The longer period delay may obstruct WYZZ's capacity to promptly and accurately assess the financial conditions, which might then contravene standards of GAAP for timely reporting and accountability.",

                "original_text": "On or prior to the 30th day after WYZZ's receipt of the Final BCF Report, WYZZ may give Nexstar a written notice (an \"Objection Notice\") indicating its objections to the Final BCF Report. If WYZZ does not give Nexstar an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Final BCF Report will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.",
                "changed_text": "On or prior to the 15th day after WYZZ's receipt of the Final BCF Report, WYZZ may give Nexstar a written notice (an \"Objection Notice\") indicating its objections to the Final BCF Report. If WYZZ does not give Nexstar an Objection Notice within such 15-day period, then the Final BCF Report will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for WYZZ to provide an objection notice from 30 to 15 days is an unreasonably short period, particularly considering the financial complexity of the BCF report. Such may be deemed unconscionable or to lack of good faith negotiation, if such is the custom. The reduction in time could potentially be viewed as a breach of good faith and fair dealing.",

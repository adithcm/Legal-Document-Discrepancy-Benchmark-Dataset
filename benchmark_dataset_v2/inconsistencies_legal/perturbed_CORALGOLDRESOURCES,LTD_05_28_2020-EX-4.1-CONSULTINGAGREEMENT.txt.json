                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination by the Consultant to 1 month and by the company to 1 week may violate employment standards legislation in British Columbia, which requires employers to provide longer notice periods or pay in lieu of notice, based on the length of service.

In addition, the Company will pay to the Consultant all reasonable expenses of the Consultant as agreed to from time to time which are incurred by the Consultant in delivery of the Services, based on monthly invoices submitted to the Company, including copies of all paid receipts; plus harmonized sales taxes or goods and services taxes, as the case may be, in addition to the Consulting Fees, which taxes will be remitted by the Consultant to the Canada Revenue Agency.",

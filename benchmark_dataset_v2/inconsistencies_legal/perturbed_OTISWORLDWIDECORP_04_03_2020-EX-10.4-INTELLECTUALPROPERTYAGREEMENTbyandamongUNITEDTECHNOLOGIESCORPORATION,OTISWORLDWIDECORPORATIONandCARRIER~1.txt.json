                "original_text": "4.2.2 Without limitation, Otis and Carrier as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any case within six (6) months of the Effective Time) shall cause each member of, respectively, the Otis Group and the Carrier Group having a corporate name that includes any of the United Technologies Trademarks to apply to change its corporate name to a name that does not include any of the United Technologies Trademarks, including, within six (6) months of the Effective Time, by making any legal filings in each relevant jurisdiction necessary to effect such change worldwide.",

Legal filings in each relevant jurisdiction necessary to effect such change worldwide must be completed within twenty-four (24) months of the Effective Time.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the companies to change their corporate names and complete legal filings within six months. The modified text extends these deadlines to 18 and 24 months, respectively. While seemingly innocuous, this could conflict with state-level requirements for updating corporate registration details or trademark usage rights post-separation. For example, some states mandate updates to reflect the new corporate structure and prevent confusion within a shorter timeframe than the extended periods provided here. Therefore, this adjustment introduces a legal contradiction if the jurisdiction requires compliance within a shorter timeframe.",

                "explanation": "The original text provides a six-month window for requesting copies of tangible embodiments of intellectual property. The modified text reduces this window to 30 days. This could conflict with laws related to transition periods post-separation or acquisition, where longer periods are legally mandated to ensure a smooth transfer of assets and knowledge. Shortening the period to 30 days creates a potential legal contradiction if relevant regulations require a more extended period for the transfer of necessary IP.",

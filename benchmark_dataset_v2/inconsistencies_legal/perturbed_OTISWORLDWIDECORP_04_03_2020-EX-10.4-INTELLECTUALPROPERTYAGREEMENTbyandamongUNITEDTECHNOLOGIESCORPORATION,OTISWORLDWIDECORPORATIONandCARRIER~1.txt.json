                "original_text": "For a period of six (6) months after the Effective Time, upon written request by an Assignee Party or a Licensee Party, and solely to the extent the Assignor Party or another member of the Assignor Group or the Licensor Party or another member of the Licensor Group, respectively, has the right to do so, the Assignor Party or the Licensor Party, respectively, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (and to cause other members of the Assignor Group or the Licensor Group, respectively, to provide) to the requesting Assignee Party or the Licensee Party, respectively, copies of tangible embodiments of the Assigned Intellectual Property Rights and the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, respectively, in the possession of a member of the Assignor Group or the Licensor Group, respectively, and not in the possession of a member of the Assignee Group or the Licensee Group, respectively, upon the Effective Time, to the extent that both (a) such Assigned Intellectual Property Rights or such Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, respectively, are necessary for the ongoing conduct of the current business of the requesting Assignee Party or another member of the Assignee Group or the requesting Licensee Party or another member of the Licensee Group, respectively, or was in use in such business as of the Effective Time, and (b) such tangible embodiments are reasonably necessary for the use of such Assigned Intellectual Property Rights or such Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, respectively, identified in Section 7.1.1(a).",
                "changed_text": "Upon written request by an Assignee Party or a Licensee Party, the Assignor Party or the Licensor Party, respectively, will provide copies of tangible embodiments of the Assigned Intellectual Property Rights and the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, respectively, within thirty (30) days. There is no obligation to provide such copies if the request is made six (6) months after the Effective Time.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction by setting a fixed 30-day deadline for providing copies of intellectual property embodiments, which may not be feasible under all circumstances. The original clause allowed for a 'commercially reasonable efforts' standard over six months, whereas the modified clause mandates a strict 30-day provision. This fails to account for the volume or complexity of the request, potentially violating regulations concerning reasonable business practices. By setting the date of the obligations, it makes it non-compliant as it is not reasonable or practical to assume that the IP requested will be delivered in 30 days.",

There shall be no grace period.",
                "explanation": "By removing the 'as soon as practicable' and 'within three years' clauses and mandating immediate cessation and removal, this modification contradicts reasonable business practices and applicable trademark law. Businesses need a reasonable timeframe to rebrand and phase out trademarks, and an immediate mandate can be commercially impractical and lead to substantial losses. This immediate removal is non-compliant with trademark laws as it does not provide enough time for the business to reasonably transition.",

The disputing Party will give the other Party or Parties, as applicable, written notice of the Dispute. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of said notice, the receiving Party or Parties will submit to the other a written response. The notice and response will include: (a) a statement of each Party's position and a summary of the evidence and arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party. The executives will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties must resolve any dispute within ten (10) business days by negotiations among executives. If negotiations fail, the dispute is waived.",
                "explanation": "This drastically shortens the dispute resolution timeframe and eliminates arbitration, contravening standard commercial practice. Ten business days may not be sufficient for complex disputes, making it practically impossible to resolve disputes fairly and completely within the allotted time. Furthermore, stating that a dispute is 'waived' if negotiations fail within this short period acts as an unenforceable penalty and conflicts with the right to pursue legal remedies. This also would be non-compliant as legal issues require a time period that is outside 10 days.",

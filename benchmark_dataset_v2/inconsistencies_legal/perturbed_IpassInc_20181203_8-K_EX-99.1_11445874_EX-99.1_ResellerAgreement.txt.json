                "original_text": "3.2 Payment. All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass' other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services ten (10) days after sending written notice of a payment that is thirty (30) or more days past due.",
                "changed_text": "3.2 Payment. All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within ninety (90) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass' other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services five (5) days after sending written notice of a payment that is fifteen (15) or more days past due.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within 30 days and allows service termination after a 30-day delinquency. The modified text extends the payment term to 90 days but shortens the delinquency period before termination to 15 days. This introduces a legal contradiction because standard commercial practices and regulations often consider a shorter delinquency period (like 15 days) unreasonable, especially when the payment term is extended to 90 days. Some jurisdictions may view this as an unfair or deceptive practice.",

                "changed_text": "3.2 Payment. All payments hereunder will be in US Dollars and are due and payable within sixty (60) days after the date of invoice. iPass may terminate or modify these payment terms with reasonable notice, when, in its reasonable discretion, iPass believes that its payments may be at risk. All rights of Channel Partner are expressly made conditional upon timely payment, without the right of set off, of all amounts due by Channel Partner under the Agreement. Without limiting iPass' other available rights and remedies, iPass reserves the right to suspend or to terminate any Services two (2) days after sending written notice of a payment that is sixty (60) or more days past due. iPass may include on an invoice, and Channel Partner agrees to pay for: (i) any Services used within three hundred sixty (360) days before the date of the invoice; and (ii) any corrections to amounts invoiced within three hundred sixty (360) days after the date of the original invoice.",
                "explanation": "While extending the initial payment term to 60 days, the modification drastically reduces the notice period for service termination due to non-payment to just two days. This creates a legally questionable scenario, especially if the invoiced amount is substantial or disputed. Furthermore, the text now allows iPass to invoice services used up to 360 days prior, which may conflict with accounting standards and legal limitations on how far back a company can retroactively bill for services. This may be viewed as an abusive practice, since the other party would have a hard time disputing the amount in just two days.",

                "explanation": "This modification extends the payment deadline to an unusually long 120 days, which might be considered commercially unreasonable in many industries. Simultaneously, the notice period before service termination is reduced to a single day after the 120-day payment deadline. This combination is contradictory and potentially violates principles of fairness and good faith in contract law. A one-day notice after such a long payment period does not provide the Channel Partner with adequate opportunity to rectify the situation, especially considering potential disputes or administrative delays. This creates a high risk of unjust termination of services.",

                "explanation": "Extending the non-compete period to five years may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under California law (Business and Professions Code Section 16600), which generally prohibits non-compete agreements, especially if it unduly restricts the Developer's ability to earn a livelihood. While the contract states it is under California law, this longer duration introduces a contradiction as California courts often invalidate non-competes exceeding one year, unless narrowly tailored and justified.

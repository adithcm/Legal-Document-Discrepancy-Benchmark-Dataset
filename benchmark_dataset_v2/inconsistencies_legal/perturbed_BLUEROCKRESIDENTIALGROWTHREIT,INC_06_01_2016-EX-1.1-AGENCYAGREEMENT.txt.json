Immediately and only upon receipt of funds equal to the gross offering price of the Offered Shares, the Agent will then facilitate payment of the proceeds net of the Agent's fees specified herein, to the Company in Federal (same day) funds by wire transfer to an account at a bank acceptable to the Agent drawn to the order of the Company at the office of Bass, Berry & Sims PLC (\"BBS\"), no later than 5:30 P.M., New York time, on May 26, 2016.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will deliver the Offered Shares to or as directed by the Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Agent at or before 11:30 A.M., New York time, on May 26, 2016, or at such other time not later than thirty (30) full business days thereafter as solely determined by the Agent , such time being herein referred to as the \"Settlement Date\". Immediately and only upon receipt of funds equal to the gross offering price of the Offered Shares, the Agent will then facilitate payment of the proceeds net of the Agent's fees specified herein, to the Company at Agent's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement specifies a settlement date no later than seven business days after the initial date. The modification extends this to thirty business days and removes company approval. This introduces a contradiction because standard securities regulations typically require settlements to occur within a much shorter timeframe (T+2) to reduce risk. Additionally, removing a specific payment time like \"5:30 P.M., New York time\" and replacing it with \"at Agent's discretion\" creates uncertainty and contradicts standard contract law principles that require clearly defined payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations regarding settlement periods (e.g., Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act) which advocates for shorter settlement periods (T+2).",

                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly defines a termination date. The modified text changes this to an automatic renewal clause without the company's consent, which conflicts with contract law principles requiring mutual agreement for contract extensions. Forcing a company to continue an agency agreement without its explicit consent is not compliant.",

                "changed_text": "The Company will ensure the qualification of the Offered Shares for sale under the Agent's jurisdictions. However, the agent will solely be responsible for the expenses incurred.",
                "explanation": "The modification removes the specified one-year limit for the qualification of shares and introduces a clause where the agent will solely bear the responsibility of expenses. By removing the specific timeframe for qualification, the provision may be considered open-ended, potentially leading to qualifications being maintained longer than legally permissible or commercially reasonable, in conflict with blue sky laws that require periodic re-registration. By shifting the responsibility of incurred expenses, this violates previous conditions listed in section 5 subsection (ix) where it clearly states the \"Transaction Entities will pay all expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement\"",

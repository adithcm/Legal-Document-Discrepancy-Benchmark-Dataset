                "original_text": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days prior to scheduled termination.",
                "changed_text": "The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than five (5) days prior to scheduled termination.",
                "explanation": "This change modifies the notice period required to extend the joint venture agreement, shortening it from 30 days to 5 days. This could be problematic if Pennsylvania law requires a more substantial notice period for such extensions, potentially leading to disputes about the validity of any extensions made with such short notice. Contractual modifications typically require reasonable time for deliberation and agreement.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Pennsylvania contract law regarding reasonable notice for contract modifications and extensions. While not explicitly defined in a statute, case law might dictate a longer period for such a significant decision.",

                "original_text": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6.",
                "changed_text": "On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid at the discretion of Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers whenever Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. deems appropriate, and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as deemed appropriate by Collectible Concepts Group, Inc.",
                "explanation": "This change gives Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. unilateral control over debt payment and asset distribution upon termination, potentially violating Pennsylvania law regarding fair distribution of assets and liabilities in a joint venture dissolution. It removes the 'pro rata' distribution requirement, which is a standard expectation in such agreements.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates Pennsylvania's Uniform Partnership Act or principles of equity regarding the fair dissolution of business entities, specifically the distribution of assets and liabilities pro rata according to ownership interests.",

                "changed_text": "Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes as to its contents if given verbally. No written record is required.",
                "explanation": "This change stipulates that verbal notice is sufficient, removing the requirement for written notice. This contradicts standard business practices and legal principles regarding the need for documented evidence in contractual communications, potentially creating disputes over whether notice was actually given and what its contents were. While Pennsylvania law does not always require written notice, for significant business agreements, it is generally expected and advisable to maintain a written record.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contradicts general principles of contract law favoring written documentation of significant communications and potentially violates the Statute of Frauds if the underlying agreement requires written documentation for certain actions.",

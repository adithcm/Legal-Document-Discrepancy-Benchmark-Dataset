                "original_text": "If Biocept at any time finds that Life Technologies is not in compliance with this Section, then Biocept may notify Life Technologies in writing of such deficiencies, and if Life Technologies fails to correct such deficiencies within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, Biocept may, at its election and in addition to any other remedies, terminate the license granted to Life Technologies with respect to the Biocept Trademarks.",
                "changed_text": "If Biocept at any time finds that Life Technologies is not in compliance with this Section, then Biocept may notify Life Technologies in writing of such deficiencies, and if Life Technologies fails to correct such deficiencies within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, Biocept may, at its election and in addition to any other remedies, terminate the license granted to Life Technologies with respect to the Biocept Trademarks.",
                "explanation": "The change reduces the cure period from 30 days to 10 days. Depending on the severity and complexity of the non-compliance, 10 days may be deemed an unreasonably short period to remedy the breach, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and good faith in contract law, particularly in California where this agreement is governed.",

                "original_text": "Life Technologies shall pay Biocept within sixty (60) days following the invoice date. The parties shall disclose actual reimbursement for each Test, and shall reconcile or 'true-up' any differences between the amounts actually received by Life Technologies for each billing item or code and amounts paid to Biocept on a quarterly basis.",
                "changed_text": "Life Technologies shall pay Biocept within ninety (90) days following the invoice date. The parties shall disclose actual reimbursement for each Test, and shall reconcile or 'true-up' any differences between the amounts actually received by Life Technologies for each billing item or code and amounts paid to Biocept on an annual basis.",
                "explanation": "The modification extends the payment term to 90 days and reduces the reconciliation frequency to annually. Extending payment terms significantly beyond industry standards (30-60 days) may constitute an unfair business practice, particularly if Biocept is a smaller entity relying on timely payments. Additionally, decreasing reconciliation frequency increases the risk of financial discrepancies remaining undetected for extended periods and potentially conflicting with accounting standards and principles of accurate financial reporting.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of California's Unfair Competition Law (Business and Professions Code Section 17200) if the payment terms are deemed unconscionable or an unfair business practice.",

                "original_text": "Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before the end of the Term upon written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of this Agreement and has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days (the \"Cure Period\") after notice from the terminating party requesting cure of the breach.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from 60 days to 30 days may be considered unreasonable depending on the nature of the breach and the efforts required for remediation. Courts in California may find a 30-day cure period insufficient, especially for complex breaches, thus making the termination clause potentially unenforceable.",

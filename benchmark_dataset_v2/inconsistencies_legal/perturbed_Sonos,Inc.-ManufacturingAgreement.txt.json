                "original_text": "Payment terms are [*] from the date of acceptance by Sonos of an applicable invoice from IAC in accordance with Exhibit H and/or other applicable SOW, which acceptance may not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "Payment terms are [*] from the date of acceptance by Sonos of an applicable invoice from IAC in accordance with Exhibit H and/or other applicable SOW, which acceptance may not be unreasonably withheld. If Sonos fails to remit payment within the specified timeframe, a late fee of 50% of the outstanding balance will be automatically applied to the invoice.",
                "explanation": "Imposing a 50% late fee without proper legal justification may be considered usurious or an unreasonable penalty under California law. Late fees must be reasonably related to the actual damages incurred due to the late payment.",
                "contradicted_law": "California Civil Code Section 1671 (Liquidated Damages) and potential usury laws.",

                "explanation": "Providing only 15 days' notice for End of Life (EOL) products may be insufficient for IAC to manage its inventory and component orders, potentially leading to financial losses. This timeframe may contradict reasonable business practices and create undue hardship on IAC. California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which could be breached by such a short notice period.",

                "explanation": "A 30-day warranty for consumer electronics could be deemed unconscionable or inadequate, especially given the implied warranty of merchantability. The Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act in California requires a reasonable warranty period, and 30 days may not be considered reasonable for complex electronic devices.",

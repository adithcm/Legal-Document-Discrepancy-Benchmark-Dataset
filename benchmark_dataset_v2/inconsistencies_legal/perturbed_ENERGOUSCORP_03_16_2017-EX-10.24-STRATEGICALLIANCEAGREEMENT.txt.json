From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "changed_text": "Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of 10% per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a potential legal contradiction. Setting a late payment fee of 10% per month (120% annually) may violate usury laws in California, which place limits on the maximum interest rates that can be charged on debts. While the contract includes a clause stating 'or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less', the specified 10% creates an initial violation that might be challenged. Also, California law requires that payments to employees who are terminated from the company are obligated to have their final paycheck given to them by the company within 72 hours of being terminated. The text contradicts this rule.",

Each party will make its best reasonable effort to ensure they comply as soon as possible.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a clear deadline of fifteen (15) days for returning or destroying Confidential Information. The modified version replaces this with a vague and subjective obligation to act 'as soon as is practical' and make 'best reasonable effort'. This weakens the contractual obligation and creates uncertainty about the time frame for compliance. The change contradicts standard contract law principles that require clearly defined obligations, especially for something as important as the return of confidential information. This creates non-compliance because the original text set a deadline of 15 days, which has now been removed.",

                "explanation": "This change shortens the notification period for indemnification claims from thirty (30) business days to ten (10) business days and removes the clause protecting DIALOG in the event of a slight delay. Such a short notification period could be deemed unreasonable, especially for complex legal claims that require thorough investigation. By making any delay, regardless of prejudice to ENERGOUS, sufficient to relieve ENERGOUS of its obligations, the clause becomes potentially unconscionable. In California, the law requires sufficient time to comply with contractual obligations.",

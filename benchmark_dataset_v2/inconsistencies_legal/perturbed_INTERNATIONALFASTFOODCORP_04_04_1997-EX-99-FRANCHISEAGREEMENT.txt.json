                "original_text": "Provided, however, that t he Franchisee may temporarily cease operations for a period of time reasonably necessary to comply with the requirement of any competent governmental authority that it repair, clean remodel, or refurbish the Location. The Franchisee may also temporarily cease operations on national holidays and for a period of time reasonably necessary to complete repairs or deal with an act of God, a labor strike, civil unrest, or other emergency situation which would endanger the public or the Franchisee's employees. However, in the event that any temporary closing or discontinuance of operation permitted under this Section 2.4 exceeds 180 days, BKC shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, whereupon all rights granted to Franchisee under this Agreement shall terminate, without liability to BKC.",

                "explanation": "This change increases the permitted temporary closure period to 300 days. While seemingly minor, this could create issues with local Polish regulations concerning business operation licenses, which might mandate shorter closure periods before a license is revoked. Depending on the specific local laws, a 300-day closure period could be considered unreasonable and lead to the termination of the Franchisee's right to operate, conflicting with the protections offered under Polish commercial law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of Polish local business operation and licensing laws, depending on specific local regulations regarding the maximum permissible temporary closure duration before license revocation.",

                "changed_text": "Except as otherwise provided in Section 5 3 of the Development Agreement, by the thirtieth (30th) day of each quarter, the Franchisee shall deliver to BKC a return of Gross Sales for the preceding quarter and pay to BKC or its designee a royalty for the use of the Burger King Marks an the Burger King System calculated by applying the percentage set forth in SCHEDULE 1 against the Gross Sales for the preceding calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "The change from monthly to quarterly royalty payments could contradict Polish tax law if the Franchisee is required to declare and pay VAT (Value Added Tax) on a monthly basis. Polish VAT regulations typically necessitate monthly reporting and payment, and changing the royalty payment schedule could create discrepancies and non-compliance issues.",

The Franchisee shall retain sales records for a period of at least twelve (12) months.",
                "explanation": "Reduced record retention period to 12 months. Under Polish accounting law, companies are typically required to retain accounting records, including sales records, for at least five years for tax audit purposes. Reducing the retention period to 12 months directly contradicts this legal requirement, potentially leading to penalties and legal issues for the Franchisee during a tax audit in Poland.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violation of Polish Accounting Act requiring retention of accounting records for five years for tax purposes (specific article depends on the year of enactment and amendments).",

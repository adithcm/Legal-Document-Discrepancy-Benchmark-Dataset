The Party that incurs more than its share of the total Research and Development Costs during any such Calendar Quarter shall deliver an invoice to the other Party for an amount of cash sufficient to reconcile to the invoicing Party's agreed percentage of Research and Development Costs. Such other Party will reimburse the invoicing Party in Dollars all undisputed amounts within such expense reports under this Section 4.5 in accordance with Section 9.5 mutatis mutandis.",

                "explanation": "Changing the reimbursement timeline to 180 days introduces a legal contradiction. Standard business practices and prompt payment laws in many jurisdictions, including some states in the United States, require payments to be made within a reasonable timeframe, often 30-60 days. A 180-day delay could be deemed unreasonable and violate these regulations, making the contractual term unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "Changing the payment timeline to 90 days introduces a legal contradiction. Many states have prompt payment laws that mandate faster payment schedules, especially for smaller businesses. Requiring a 90-day turnaround, even if undisputed, could violate those laws. This timeline is also commercially unreasonable, as it hurts smaller company and thus is vulnerable to challenge.",

Restricting it to one year poses legal risks and contradicts trade secret laws that protect confidential information indefinitely if properly maintained.

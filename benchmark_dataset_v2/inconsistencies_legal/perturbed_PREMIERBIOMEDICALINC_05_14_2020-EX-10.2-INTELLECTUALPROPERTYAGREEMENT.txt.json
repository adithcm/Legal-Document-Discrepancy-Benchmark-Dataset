            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "2. The total sum of non-paid invoices (estimated to be approximately $80,000) payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC, previously owed by Premier to Marv up until the effective date of this Agreement, payable in total by no later than July 20, 2020.",
                "changed_text": "2. The total sum of non-paid invoices (estimated to be approximately $80,000) payable to Marv Enterprises, LLC, previously owed by Premier to Marv up until the effective date of this Agreement, payable in total at the discretion of THI, with no guaranteed payment date.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces uncertainty and potential violation of prompt payment laws, which often require specific payment deadlines. By removing the definite payment date (July 20, 2020) and making it discretionary, the contract becomes vague and potentially unenforceable regarding payment terms.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates state-specific prompt payment laws or general contract law principles requiring definiteness of terms.",

                "changed_text": "b. THI shall pay in United States dollars to Marv at PO Box 1332, Hermitage, PA 16148, or other address provided by Marv, the royalties payable in accordance with such statement, whenever THI deems appropriate and is in good financial standing.",
                "explanation": "The modification makes royalty payments entirely discretionary, contradicting the original intention of scheduled payments within 30 days. This could be considered a breach of contract or a violation of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Also, the quarterly payment schedule could also be a factor, since some states need to see payment within less than 30 days. Payment upon financial stability also means that if the company isn't doing well, payment may never be delivered.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract, implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, potential violation of state laws requiring timely payments.",

                "original_text": "Affirmation of payment must be received by Marv within fourteen (14) days of the mailing date of the notice or the THI shall be deemed to have denied payment.",
                "changed_text": "Affirmation of payment must be received by Marv within seven (7) days of the mailing date of the notice or the THI shall be deemed to have denied payment.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the affirmation period for IP cost payments from 14 days to 7 days creates an unreasonable time constraint for THI to review and approve payments. This could be seen as an attempt to unfairly restrict THI's rights and potentially lead to unintended denial of payments due to the shortened timeframe.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates contract law principles of fairness and reasonableness, especially if the 7-day period is insufficient for proper review and approval processes.",

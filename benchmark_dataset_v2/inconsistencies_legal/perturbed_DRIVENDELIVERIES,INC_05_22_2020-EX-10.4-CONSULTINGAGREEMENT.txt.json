                "original_text": "7.2. Termination. Either Party may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, upon giving the other party thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination pursuant to Section 12.7 of this Agreement. The Company may terminate this Agreement immediately and without prior notice if Consultant refuses to or is unable to perform the Services or is in breach of any material provision of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "7.2. Termination. Either Party may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, upon giving the other party five (5) days prior written notice of such termination pursuant to Section 12.7 of this Agreement. The Company may terminate this Agreement immediately and without prior notice if Consultant refuses to or is unable to perform the Services or is in breach of any material provision of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 5 days could be considered an unreasonably short period, especially if the consultant needs time to find other work. Some jurisdictions may view such a short notice period as a violation of implied contract terms or fair dealing, particularly if the consultant has made significant investments or foregone other opportunities based on the agreement. California law favors reasonable notice periods, and 5 days might not meet that threshold in many cases.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment period to 90 days after termination may violate California Labor Code sections that require prompt payment of wages upon termination. While this is a consulting agreement, extending the payment period this long could be seen as an unreasonable delay, particularly if the consultant is economically dependent on these payments. California law emphasizes the timely payment of earned wages, and 90 days is a potentially problematic delay.",

Consultant expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert or hire away, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away any person employed by the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information. Consultant also expressly agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly on his own behalf, or in the service or on behalf of others, solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any customer, client, supplier or vendor of the Company for a period of five (5) years for any reason, and without limitation for the purpose of harming the Company or of obtaining and disseminating its trade secrets, or other proprietary and confidential information",

                "explanation": "Extending the non-solicitation period to ten years is likely unenforceable under California law. California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits non-compete agreements, and this non-solicitation clause, due to its length and broad scope, could be viewed as a de facto non-compete, unreasonably restricting the consultant's ability to earn a living and engage in their profession. California courts tend to disfavor overly broad restrictions on post-employment activities.",

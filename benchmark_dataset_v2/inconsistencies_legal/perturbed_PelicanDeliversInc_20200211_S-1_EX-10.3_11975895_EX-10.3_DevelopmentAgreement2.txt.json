Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",

Any Change Request shall be sufficient to identify, with clarity, any objection, correction, change or amendment to such Milestone Deliverable. In the absence of a Change Request from Client within the time periods detailed herein, the Milestone Deliverable will be deemed accepted by Client.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the time frame for submitting a Change Request to two days may be unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with reasonable business practices and implied duties of good faith. This is because some states imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations. Two days may not provide sufficient time for a thorough review and identification of defects, potentially violating this implied duty. The contract is based in Washington State, however, it is best to make the assumption of U.S. law.",

Upon Client's receipt of a Milestone Deliverable following Developer's modification pursuant to Change Request (a Modified Deliverable), Client will have five (5) days to inspect, test and reevaluate such Modified Deliverable to determine acceptance.

                "explanation": "Reducing the developer's correction time to five days and increasing the client's re-evaluation time to ten days could be problematic. This could violate the implied duty of good faith by giving the client more time to re-evaluate but significantly reduces the time for the developer to fix the issues. The original 20 days is a reasonable time, however, the change to five days places the developer at a serious disadvantage which is a potential issue under US contract law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice for termination without cause to one day is unreasonable and could be deemed unconscionable, depending on the specific circumstances and the relative bargaining power of the parties. Courts in the United States may find such a short notice period violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if it causes significant harm to the other party. The short notice period also violates the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.",

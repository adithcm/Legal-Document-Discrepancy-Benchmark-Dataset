                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within seven business days. Changing this to 120 business days introduces a delay that could be considered an unreasonable delay in payment, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing present in most US states. Also, depending on the specific goods or services, state laws might mandate quicker payment terms.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies payment within 30 days after the end of the month. Extending this to 90 days constitutes an unreasonably long payment term, which could be construed as a breach of contract, bad faith, or violation of state-specific prompt payment laws if such laws apply to the nature of the fees.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the audit period to 1 month and the notice period to 5 days, while increasing the length of the audit, places an undue burden on Ebix.

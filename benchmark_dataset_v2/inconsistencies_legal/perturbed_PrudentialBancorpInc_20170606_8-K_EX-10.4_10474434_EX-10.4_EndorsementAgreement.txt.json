                "explanation": "Increasing the timeframe for the employer to provide a statement to the insurer to 180 days after the employee's death may conflict with Pennsylvania's laws regarding prompt payment of life insurance benefits. Pennsylvania law requires insurance companies to pay claims promptly after receiving proof of death and claim documentation. While there's no specific statutory deadline for *employer* action here, unduly delaying this notification could hinder the insurer's ability to meet its own prompt payment obligations under state regulations.",

                "original_text": "B. All payments are due on the later of: (1) within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice; (2) the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice, or; (3) if the twenty-seventh (27th) of the month following receipt of the invoice is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day thereafter.",
                "changed_text": "B. All payments are due 90 days after receipt of the invoice, regardless of weekends or holidays.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within fifteen days of the invoice or by the 27th of the following month. Louisiana law does not allow contractual payment deadlines to extend beyond unreasonably long periods. The modified text specifies a 90-day payment window, which may be viewed as an excessive delay in payment, potentially conflicting with principles of fair and prompt payment and state laws.",

Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",

CLAIMS, SUITS, AND TIME FOR FILING:\n\nAs a condition precedent to recovery by Shipper for loss, damage, or delay in receipt or delivery of Shipper's Products for which Carrier may be responsible, Shipper's claim must be filed in writing with Carrier within 3 months after delivery of the affected Products, or, in case of Carrier's failure to make delivery of Shipper's Products, then within 3 months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against Carrier only within one (1) year from the day when the incident happen. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted by Shipper on such claims in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such claims will not be paid and Carrier will not be liable.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires claims to be filed within nine months and suits to be instituted within two years and one day after claim disallowance.  The modified text reduces the claim filing period to 3 months and the suit filing deadline to 1 year from the incident. This contradicts the prescriptive period for contract claims under Louisiana law. The specific laws in Louisiana generally allow a longer period for filing such claims, making the contractual term less favorable to the claimant.",

If Product received by Carrier does not meet the quality specifications set forth in this Item No. 3, Carrier reserves the right to charge the Shipper the greater of (i) the actual costs and expenses incurred by Carrier to treat, handle, or otherwise dispose of all such contaminated Product, or (ii) a one-hundred (100) cents per Barrel charge for the volume of contaminated Product transported by Shipper (\"Off-Spec Penalty\"). If a composite sample, spot sample, or the results of any other test demonstrates that a Shipper's Product delivered to Carrier fails to meet the quality specifications set forth in this Item No. 3, the total penalty will be assessed by multiplying the Off-Spec Penalty by the total volume of Shipper's Product (in barrels) received by Carrier during the ticket period when Carrier received the contaminated Product.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows the Carrier to charge either the actual cost of dealing with contaminated product, or $1 per barrel of contaminated product. The modified text replaces this with a fixed penalty of $10,000 per barrel. This change may violate the Louisiana law against penalties that are grossly disproportionate to actual damages, and thus unenforceable due to being considered an illegal penalty.

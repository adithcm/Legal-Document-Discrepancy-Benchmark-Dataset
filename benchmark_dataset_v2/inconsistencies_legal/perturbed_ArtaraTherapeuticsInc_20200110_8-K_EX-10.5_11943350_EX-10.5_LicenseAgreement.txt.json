                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (\"Confidential Information\").",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after its termination or expiration each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (\"Confidential Information\").",
                "explanation": "The original agreement stipulates a seven-year confidentiality period post-termination. Shortening this to one year could be deemed unreasonably short, especially concerning trade secrets, potentially conflicting with state laws protecting trade secrets, such as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which many states have adopted. The UTSA protects trade secrets for as long as they remain confidential and provide a competitive advantage, implying protection beyond a mere one-year term.",

                "original_text": "University and/or Principal Investigator shall provide ArTara with a copy of any proposed Publication for review and comment at least […***…] prior to submission thereof for publication. ArTara shall have […***…], after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of […***…] from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication.",
                "changed_text": "University and/or Principal Investigator shall provide ArTara with a copy of any proposed Publication for review and comment at least five (5) days prior to submission thereof for publication. ArTara shall have two (2) days, after receipt of said copy to object to such proposed Publication because there is Confidential Information which needs protection. In the event that ArTara makes such objection, University and/or Principal Investigator shall refrain from submitting such Publication for a maximum of five (5) days from date of receipt of such objection in order for ArTara to file patent application(s) directed to patentable subject matter contained in the proposed Publication.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides an unspecified amount of time for ArTara to review publications and raise objections related to confidential information. By changing the review and objection periods to 'five (5) days' and 'two (2) days' respectively, and the maximum time for refraining from submission to file a patent application to 'five (5) days', the modified text introduces a legal contradiction. This is because these shortened timeframes are insufficient for a thorough review and patent filing, particularly in complex technological fields. This timeframe could violate the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in many contracts, especially if the confidential information is critical and requires more extensive protection.",

                "original_text": "The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds and will provide that the carrier will notify University in writing at least […***…] prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage. Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such […***…] period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the […***…] period without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "changed_text": "The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds and will provide that the carrier will notify University in writing at least ten (10) days prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage. Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such ten (10) days period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the ten (10) days period without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "explanation": "By reducing the insurance notification period to 'ten (10) days,' the modified text could create a legal contradiction. Many insurance contracts and state regulations require insurance companies to provide at least 30 days' notice (or more in some jurisdictions) to additional insureds before a policy is canceled or significantly altered. This shortened period may be insufficient to allow the University to secure replacement coverage, potentially violating the principle of adequate notice and creating undue risk for the University, and conflict with insurance regulations in Iowa.",

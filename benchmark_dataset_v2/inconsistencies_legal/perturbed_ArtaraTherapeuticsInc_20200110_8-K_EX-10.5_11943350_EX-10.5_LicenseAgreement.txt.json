                "original_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years after its termination or expiration each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (\"Confidential Information\").",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after its termination or expiration each Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in confidence and, except as authorized by this Agreement, not use any know-how, data, processes, techniques, formulas, test data and other information disclosed by the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") and which for any of the foregoing, if written, is marked \"Confidential\" by the Disclosing Party or, if verbal or visual, is identified in writing as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure and reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of the verbal or visual disclosure (\"Confidential Information\").",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly given the nature of the confidential information, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws that require protection for as long as the information remains a trade secret and provides a competitive advantage. This may render the confidentiality clause unenforceable or expose ArTara to legal challenges.",

                "original_text": "ArTara will obtain and maintain commercial general liability insurance with a reputable and financially secure insurance carrier prior to clinical testing, making, using, importing, offering to sell, or selling any licensed Product or engaging in any other act involving any licensed Product or the patent rights, if such act could possibly create risk of a claim against University Indemnitees for personal injury or property damage.\n(a) The insurance will identify University Indemnitees as additional insureds and will provide that the carrier will notify University in writing at least […***…] prior to cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage. Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage within such […***…] period, University will have the right to termination this Agreement effective as of the end of the […***…] period without notice or any additional cure period.",

Should ArTara fail to obtain replacement insurance, University will have the right to termination this Agreement without notice or any additional cure period.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for a reputable and financially secure insurance carrier and the notification period for cancellation/non-renewal, the modified clause creates a risk for the University. Many states have laws mandating certain minimum financial stability requirements for insurance carriers to ensure they can meet their obligations. Eliminating these safeguards and the notice period could violate the University's duty to protect its assets and could be considered a breach of fiduciary duty by University representatives.",

                "original_text": "Either Party may terminate the Project and all commitments and obligations with respect thereto, subject to Section 8.3 herein, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. In the event of any termination of the Project by University, (a) University agrees to complete Phase I and II of the Project, and (b) ArTara will continue to provide annual funding until the completion of Phase II. Upon termination of the Project by ArTara this Agreement will terminate subject to Section 8.3 and ArTara will reassign to University the IND if assignment thereof previously occurred pursuant to Section 4.3.",
                "changed_text": "Either Party may terminate the Project and all commitments and obligations with respect thereto, subject to Section 8.3 herein, upon five (5) days written notice to the other Party. Upon termination of the Project by ArTara this Agreement will terminate subject to Section 8.3 and ArTara will not be required to reassign to University the IND if assignment thereof previously occurred pursuant to Section 4.3.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the written notice period for termination to five days is unreasonable and potentially contradicts principles of good faith and fair dealing, especially considering the investments and commitments made by both parties. Additionally, Removing the requirement for ArTara to reassign the IND (Investigational New Drug application) to the University after termination creates a significant disadvantage for the University. The IND is crucial for further research and development. This change could be deemed unconscionable or a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it deprives the University of a key asset based on the work they have contributed.",

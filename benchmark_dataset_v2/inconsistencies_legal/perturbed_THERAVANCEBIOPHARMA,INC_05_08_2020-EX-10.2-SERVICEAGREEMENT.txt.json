                "explanation": "In the UK, where this contract applies, statutory minimum notice periods increase with length of service. While 1 week's notice might be compliant for employees with very short service, it is insufficient and contradicts legal requirements for someone whose employment commenced in 2013 as stated in section 2.2. They would be entitled to at least one week per year of service, up to a maximum of 12 weeks. Therefore, stipulating 1 week's notice for all scenarios introduces a legal contradiction.",

The Executive's employment will terminate immediately and any PILON due to the Executive in accordance with the provisions of this clause 17 will be paid within 28 days. The PILON will be equal to the basic salary (as at the Termination Date) which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at clause 2 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period) less deductions required by law.",

                "explanation": "In the UK, there is a statutory requirement for employers to pay wages and outstanding payments, including PILON, promptly after termination. While there is no explicit legal deadline stated in days, a delay of 90 days in paying PILON would be considered unreasonable and could lead to a breach of contract claim and potential penalties for late payment of wages. A reasonable timeframe is typically within a month, coinciding with the usual pay cycle.",

This obligation shall not affect any responsibility the Executive has as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel.",
                "explanation": "While non-solicitation clauses are generally enforceable in the UK, a two-year restriction may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable depending on the specific facts and the seniority/influence of the employee. UK courts will scrutinize the length and scope of post-termination restrictions, and if they are deemed to be wider than reasonably necessary to protect the employer's legitimate business interests, they will be struck down. A blanket two-year ban, without considering the executive's role or the specific risks, is likely to be seen as an unlawful restraint of trade.",

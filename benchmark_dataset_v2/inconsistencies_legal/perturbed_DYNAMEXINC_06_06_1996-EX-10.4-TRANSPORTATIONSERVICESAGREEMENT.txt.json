                "original_text": "5.5    Every invoice shall be reviewed by the invoiced Party and subject to        paragraphs 5.2, shall pay the invoice net fifteen (15) days from the        date of invoicing. Invoices shall be delivered to the invoiced Party        within three (3) days of the date of invoicing.",
                "changed_text": "5.5    Every invoice shall be reviewed by the invoiced Party and subject to        paragraphs 5.2, shall pay the invoice net sixty (60) days from the        date of invoicing. Invoices shall be delivered to the invoiced Party        within ten (10) days of the date of invoicing.",
                "explanation": "Extended payment terms to 60 days and delivery time to 10 days is not an incentive and is unreasonable, potentially violating prompt payment laws or industry standards in Ontario, where faster payment periods are common and legally expected.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially contradicts general principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law; also, could be considered an unfair business practice under Ontario's consumer protection laws if applied to consumer transactions.",

                "changed_text": "6.2    A Party shall, in the event of loss, damage or delay to Freight while in        its care, custody or control, immediately notify the other Party of the         loss or damage, carry out an investigation of the incident to determine        the cause of such loss, damage or delay and shall within\n\n7        ninety (90) days of the event of loss, damage or delay or knowledge of        such incident of loss, damage or delay, whichever is later, as the case        may be, report its findings to the other Party.",
                "explanation": "Extending the reporting timeline to 90 days for loss or damage to freight is unreasonably long and may violate common carrier regulations that require timely investigation and resolution of claims. A longer period extends the liability of potential damage.",
                "contradicted_law": "Common carrier liability principles; potentially violates requirements for prompt claim resolution under the Carmack Amendment (if applicable to interstate transport in the US).",

                "explanation": "Changing 'at least thirty (30) days or as soon as possible' to 'ten (10) days after any change' creates a contradiction. Reducing the notice period and shifting it to *after* the change violates regulations requiring advance notice for significant operational changes that could affect service quality or safety. It is an unreasonably short time frame to have the other party prepare for a possible action.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates general requirements for maintaining adequate operating authority and providing timely notice of changes that could impact regulatory compliance or contractual performance; violates general principles of foreseeability.",

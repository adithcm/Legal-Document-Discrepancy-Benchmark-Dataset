                "explanation": "Changing the payment term to 60 days after receipt of invoice may conflict with the Texas Prompt Payment Act, which requires payment within 30 days for certain contracts, especially those involving governmental entities, and can create issues of reasonable business practice.",

Equipment\npurchased from ITS, which becomes defective within that time period will be\nrepaired by ITS at its  headquarters  in San  Antonio,  Texas at no cost to\nCOMWARE  beyond cost of shipping  the  equipment  to ITS.

Such a short notice period might not allow sufficient time for the other party to mitigate damages or find alternative arrangements.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the lookback period for prior convictions and civil actions from ten years to five years could contradict franchise laws that require a more extensive disclosure period to protect potential franchisees. This creates non-compliance because many states require disclosure of past legal issues beyond five years to ensure transparency and protect franchisees from entering agreements with franchisors who have a history of misconduct.",

Any orders relating to franchise under a Federal, State or Canadian franchise, securities, antitrust, trade regulation or trade practice law will be disclosed at the Franchisor's discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly weakens the disclosure requirements regarding injunctive or restrictive orders. By limiting the disclosure to orders 'relating to the franchise' and making the disclosure of orders under other laws discretionary, the modified clause fails to comply with the full disclosure requirements of franchise laws. This creates a potential conflict because franchise regulations often mandate the disclosure of broader categories of legal actions to provide a comprehensive picture of the franchisor's legal history and potential risks to franchisees.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for bankruptcy disclosures from ten years to five years may not meet the full disclosure requirements under various state and federal franchise laws.

                "explanation": "This change reduces the look-back period for disclosing prior convictions and civil actions from ten years to two years. This contradicts franchise disclosure laws, which typically require a longer disclosure period (e.g., ten years) to adequately inform potential franchisees of the franchisor's litigation history. This reduced timeframe creates non-compliance by potentially concealing relevant information that the franchisee is legally entitled to know before entering the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Similar to the change in litigation disclosure, this modification reduces the look-back period for bankruptcy disclosures from ten years to two years. This contradicts franchise disclosure requirements which mandate a longer period to inform franchisees about the financial stability and history of the franchisor and related parties. By shortening the period, it fails to provide sufficient information which is against disclosure laws.",

This is a contradiction in how it treats the information. In addition, New York and Federal Laws allow a 10-year window for bankruptcy and litigation disclosure.",

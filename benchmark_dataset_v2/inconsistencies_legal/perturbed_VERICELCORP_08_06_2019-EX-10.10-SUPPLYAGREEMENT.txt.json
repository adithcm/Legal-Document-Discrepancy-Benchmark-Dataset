It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The Parties' respective rights and responsibilities under Sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the License Agreement shall apply as such Section pertains to the Parties' performance under this Agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows the parties to specify the payment term. The change fixes the payment term to 90 days, which might conflict with standard payment terms in commercial transactions regulated under state-specific prompt payment laws (e.g., some states require payment within 30 days for certain goods or services).",

Any such Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product unless otherwise specified by Vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product.",
                "changed_text": "Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within 5 days after receipt of a delivery of Product hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection (\"Rejection Notice\") (i) if the Product does not constitute Conforming Product (\"Non-Conforming Product\") or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product unless otherwise specified by Vericel.

                "explanation": "The modified text reduces the time frame for Vericel to provide a rejection notice for non-conforming products or shortages to 5 days, and for latent defects to 10 days after confirmation. This shortened timeframe could be deemed commercially unreasonable, particularly for complex products requiring thorough inspection, and could violate implied warranty laws under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which typically require a reasonable time for inspection and rejection.",

In the event that MediWound, any of its employees or contractors, any Supplier or any of a Supplier's employees or contractors has been debarred, MediWound shall immediately remove or have removed such Person from thereafter performing Manufacturing or supply activities under this Agreement with respect to the Product upon learning of such debarment. In the event that Vericel, any of its employees or contractors, any Sublicensee or any of such Sublicensee's employees or contractors has been debarred, it shall immediately remove or have removed such Person from thereafter performing distribution activities under this Agreement with respect to the Product upon learning of such debarment.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires prompt notification of debarment, and the change modifies that to be within 60 days, and allows 30 days for the person to be removed. Debarment is a serious issue with legal implications, especially concerning FDA-regulated products. Delaying the notification and removal violates the requirement for immediate action and could be seen as non-compliance with regulatory standards and cGMP, potentially leading to penalties or sanctions by regulatory authorities.",

                "original_text": "Vericel's review time shall not exceed [***] after its receipt of the artwork from MediWound. In the event that Vericel requests any changes to the labeling, MediWound shall make such changes as promptly as possible and return such labeling artwork to Vericel for its final review and approval, which it shall complete with [***] after its receipt of the modified artwork.",
                "changed_text": "Vericel's review time shall not exceed 1 Business Day after its receipt of the artwork from MediWound. In the event that Vericel requests any changes to the labeling, MediWound shall make such changes as promptly as possible and return such labeling artwork to Vericel for its final review and approval, which it shall complete within 1 Business Day after its receipt of the modified artwork.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a certain amount of time (represented by [***]) for Vericel to review labeling artwork. The modified text reduces this review period to '1 Business Day'. This creates a potential conflict with regulatory requirements, as pharmaceutical labeling review often necessitates a more extended period to ensure compliance with FDA regulations. A one-day review period may be deemed insufficient and could lead to non-compliance, especially given the complexity of pharmaceutical labeling.",

MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or mitigate such potential Supply Failure.",
                "changed_text": "In the event that MediWound becomes aware of the existence of a situation that may lead to a Supply Failure, then MediWound shall notify Vericel of the particular circumstances only if it materially impacts MediWound's finances. MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or mitigate such potential Supply Failure.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires MediWound to promptly notify Vericel of any situation that might lead to a supply failure. The modified text changes this to require notification only if the supply failure materially impacts MediWound's finances. This change contradicts regulations that require transparency and proactive communication regarding potential disruptions to the supply of pharmaceutical products. By limiting notification to situations with financial impact on MediWound, the modified text could delay or prevent Vericel from taking timely action to mitigate potential supply disruptions, violating cGMP and other regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "MediWound shall advise Vericel promptly, but in any event within [***] on becoming aware of an authorized agent of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder and in connection with the Manufacturing of the Products. MediWound agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit one or more Vericel representatives to be present for all or part of such visit or inspection if Vericel so requests. MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to Vericel a copy of all material information supplied and/or issued by any Regulatory Authority to the extent that such report relates to the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, or the ability of MediWound or the Suppliers to so Manufacture or supply hereunder, within [***] of its receipt of such information.",
                "changed_text": "MediWound shall advise Vericel only if there is a finding of fault on becoming aware of an authorized agent of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder and in connection with the Manufacturing of the Products. MediWound will allow Vericel representatives to be present at their discretion. MediWound shall furnish to Vericel a summary of the findings to the extent that such report relates to the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, or the ability of MediWound or the Suppliers to so Manufacture or supply hereunder, if they find it reasonably necessary.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates prompt notification (within a defined timeframe) of regulatory inspections and the provision of all material information to Vericel. The modified text significantly weakens these requirements. By requiring notification only 'if there is a finding of fault', limiting Vericel's presence to MediWound's discretion, and only providing a summary of findings 'if they find it reasonably necessary', the modified text impedes Vericel's ability to oversee compliance and could violate obligations to regulatory agencies, such as the FDA. This change also undermines Vericel's ability to promptly address and correct any issues identified during inspections, which is a critical aspect of cGMP compliance.",

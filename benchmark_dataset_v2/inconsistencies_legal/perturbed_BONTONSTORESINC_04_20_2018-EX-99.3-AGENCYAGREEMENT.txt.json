                "explanation": "This change reduces the objection period for lease/contract assignments to 10 days. This contradicts standard bankruptcy practices that typically provide longer periods (e.g., 21 days) for counterparties to object to such assignments, potentially violating due process and creditors' rights under Chapter 11.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the return period to 2 days for pre-closing merchandise is unreasonably short. Consumer protection laws, even in liquidation scenarios, generally imply a reasonable return timeframe. Limiting returns to 2 days could be deemed deceptive or unfair, conflicting with consumer protection standards.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the acceptance period for gift certificates to only 2 days after the sale commencement is problematic. Many states have laws governing the redemption of gift certificates, and arbitrarily limiting their validity to such a short window can violate these regulations and harm consumers who reasonably expect to use their gift certificates.",

                "original_text": "Records/Audit. Intuit will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of Impressions delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Client may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Client unless the number of Impressions are determined to have been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Impressions due to Client, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection.   In addition, if the audit reveals such shortfall in the number of Impressions generated, Intuit shall continue to display Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links on the Intuit Sites as set forth herein.  The audit rights set forth herein shall continue for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement for any reason.  No such audit may occur more than once a year during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "Records/Audit. Intuit will maintain accurate records with respect to the calculation of Impressions delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Client may, upon no less than five (5) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent auditor to inspect all relevant records of Intuit. The audit rights set forth herein shall not continue following the termination of this Agreement for any reason. No such audit may occur more than four times a year during the Term, with a 30-day blackout period before and after Intuit's fiscal year end.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a perturbation by reducing the notice period for an audit from 30 days to 5 days, which may be unreasonably short and contradict typical business practices and legal standards for providing adequate notice. Additionally, the elimination of audit rights after termination and increasing the frequency of audits with blackout periods could be viewed as restrictive and potentially contradict the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Contractual provisions for audits often require reasonable notice to ensure the party being audited has adequate time to prepare.",

Separate and apart from the fees in Subsection 10.1 above, at such time as Client has acquired [***] New Customers (the \"Minimum Customer Number\") Client will pay Intuit [***] of the Net Transaction Revenues it receives from each New Customer acquired by Client above the Minimum Customer Number (\"Transaction Fee\").  Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, Client will provide a monthly report (the \"Transaction Fee Report\") to Intuit. The Transaction Fee Report will report the Net Transaction Revenue and Transaction Fees for such month. All Transaction Fees due per the Transaction Fee Report will be paid with the submission of such Report.",

Client will provide a report (the \"Transaction Fee Report\") to Intuit at the Client's discretion. All Transaction Fees due per the Transaction Fee Report will be paid within 90 days of the report submission, subject to Intuit's acceptance of the report.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a perturbation by making the reporting and payment timeline vague. Removing the fixed 15-day deadline and replacing it with 'at Client's discretion' and 'within 90 days of report submission, subject to Intuit's acceptance' creates uncertainty. This can contradict laws or regulations that require timely and predictable payments or reporting, such as tax laws or securities regulations if the revenue is significant.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches a material obligation hereunder and such breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days following the notice to the breaching party of the breach and the notifying party's intention to terminate.  All undisputed payments that have accrued prior to the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason will be payable in full within thirty (30) days thereof.  In addition, upon the termination of this Agreement by Client for any reason, a pro-rata amount of the Monthly Payment Fee shall be refunded to Client calculated as follows: the Monthly Payment Fee less the cost of the Impressions displayed for such month as of the effective date of the termination, calculated on an average CPM basis.",
                "changed_text": "Termination. Intuit may terminate this Agreement at any time, without cause, upon written notice to Client. Client may only terminate this Agreement if Intuit ceases to conduct business. All undisputed payments that have accrued prior to the termination of this Agreement will be forfeited. No refunds will be provided.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a significant imbalance in the termination rights, granting Intuit unilateral termination power without cause while severely restricting Client's ability to terminate. Furthermore, forfeiting accrued payments upon termination and denying refunds may be considered unconscionable and could violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Many jurisdictions have laws protecting against unfair or oppressive contract terms.",

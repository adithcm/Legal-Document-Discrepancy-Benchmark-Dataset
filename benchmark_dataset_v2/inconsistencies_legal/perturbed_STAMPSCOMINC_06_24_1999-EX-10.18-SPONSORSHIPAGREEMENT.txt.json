Client may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in connection with the inspection will be paid by Client unless the number of Impressions are determined to have been less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the Impressions due to Client, in which case Client will be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for such inspection. In addition, if the audit reveals such shortfall in the number of Impressions generated, Intuit shall continue to display Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links on the Intuit Sites as set forth herein. The audit rights set forth herein shall continue for one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement for any reason. No such audit may occur more than once a year during the Term.",

Client may, upon no less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice to Intuit, cause an independent auditor of Intuit's choosing to inspect all relevant records of Intuit upon which the calculation of Impressions under the Usage Reports are based during Client's normal business hours. The fees charged by such auditor in connection with the inspection will be paid by Client regardless of the inspection's outcome. In addition, if the audit reveals such shortfall in the number of Impressions generated, Intuit is not obligated to display Client's Banner Advertisements, Client Graphics, Sponsor Client Graphics and Links on the Intuit Sites as set forth herein. The audit rights set forth herein shall not continue following the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Such audit may occur four times a year during the Term.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the notice period for audits, mandates that the auditor is selected by Intuit (creating a conflict of interest), removes Intuit's obligation to correct impression shortfalls, eliminates audit rights after termination, and increases the frequency of audits, potentially violating California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by making the audit process unreasonable and burdensome.",

                "explanation": "This modification removes the schedule for monthly installment payments and gives Intuit complete discretion over when the remaining balance is due.

All undisputed payments that have accrued prior to the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason will be forfeited by the breaching party and will become payable at Intuit's discretion. Upon termination of this Agreement by Client for any reason, no refunds are granted.",
                "explanation": "This modification significantly favors Intuit by granting them the right to terminate without cause, while severely restricting Client's termination rights. It shortens the cure period for Client's breaches to 5 days, eliminates the pro-rata refund upon termination, and causes all accrued and undisputed payments to be forfeited by the Client in the event the Client breaches the contract. This creates an imbalance in the agreement and may violate California's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing due to the inequitable termination terms.",

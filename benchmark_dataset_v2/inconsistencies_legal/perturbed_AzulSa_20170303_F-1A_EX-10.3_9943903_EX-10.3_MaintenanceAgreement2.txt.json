In case the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the Parties do not agree on this choice with 3 days from the date the last arbitrator is appointed, the third arbitrator will be appointed by the ICC Court.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframes for dispute resolution and arbitrator appointment to extremely short durations (1-3 days) introduces a legal contradiction. While New York law (specified in Clause 5.1) does not explicitly mandate specific timeframes for these processes, such short timeframes could be deemed commercially unreasonable and potentially violate principles of fair dealing and good faith, which are implied in New York contract law. A court could find these deadlines impractical and unenforceable, especially given the complexities of international arbitration.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to six months is a legal contradiction because it may be deemed commercially unreasonable and inadequate to protect sensitive business information, particularly trade secrets. Although New York law doesn't prescribe a specific duration for confidentiality clauses, courts consider the nature of the information and industry standards when determining reasonableness. Six months may be insufficient for information with long-term value or competitive advantage, potentially conflicting with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under New York contract law.",

The Parties shall immediately cease all communication and not attempt to settle the Dispute amicably.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a legal contradiction by forcing immediate litigation in Brazil, despite the contract specifying New York law and arbitration as the dispute resolution mechanism in the original text. It effectively nullifies the arbitration agreement, which could be challenged under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) in the United States, specifically in New York, if one party attempts to enforce the arbitration clause. This contradicts the principle that arbitration agreements are generally enforceable and that parties must follow the agreed-upon dispute resolution process.",

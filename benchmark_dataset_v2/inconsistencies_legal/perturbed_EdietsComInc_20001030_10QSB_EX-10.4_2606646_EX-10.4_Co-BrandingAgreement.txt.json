                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Women.com, in its sole discretion, may withdraw specific or general permission to use the Women.com Marks upon seventy-two (72) hours written notice to eDiets. Upon expiration of such notice period, eDiets shall immediately discontinue use of the applicable Women.com Marks.",
                "changed_text": "Women.com, in its sole discretion, may withdraw specific or general permission to use the Women.com Marks upon twelve (12) hours written notice to eDiets. Upon expiration of such notice period, eDiets shall immediately discontinue use of the applicable Women.com Marks.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for trademark usage withdrawal to 12 hours introduces a contradiction because it may not provide sufficient time for eDiets to comply with the demand, potentially leading to legal disputes and violating standard business practice of providing reasonable notice. This timeframe is unreasonably short for winding down marketing campaigns.",

Receiving Party shall then certify the same in writing and that no copies have been retained by Receiving Party, its employees, agents or contractors.",

Receiving Party shall then certify the same in writing and that no copies have been retained by Receiving Party, its employees, agents or contractors.",
                "explanation": "Extending the period for returning confidential information to ninety days increases the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of the information during that extended timeframe. While not directly illegal, a very long return period is commercially unreasonable and contrary to standard confidentiality practices, and weakens the protection of trade secrets. Standard practice is 14-30 days.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to 10 days is unreasonable and contradictory to established legal standards for commercial contracts. Such a short period may not allow sufficient time for the breaching party to rectify the issue, especially for complex breaches, potentially leading to unfair termination of the agreement and claims of breach of contract and bad faith.",

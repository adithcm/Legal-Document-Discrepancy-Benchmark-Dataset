In the event that eDiets fails, within five (5) days after submission by Women.com, to provide Women.com with necessary revisions thereto, such failure shall be deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits.",

                "explanation": "The modification changes the timeframe for eDiets to provide necessary revisions from five days to one day. This is a legal contradiction because it creates an unreasonably short timeframe that could be deemed insufficient for adequate review and response, potentially violating general principles of fairness and reasonable business practices. Courts may find this timeframe unconscionable, making the clause unenforceable.",

Upon expiration of such notice period, eDiets shall immediately discontinue use of the applicable Women.com Marks.",
                "explanation": "The original contract allows for 72 hours' notice before Women.com can withdraw permission to use its marks. By shortening this to 12 hours, the modified contract potentially creates an unreasonable burden on eDiets to cease using the marks quickly, which may not be feasible for marketing materials and could expose eDiets to damages. This creates a contradiction with principles of reasonable notice and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original text gives 15 days for the return of confidential information, while the changed text only gives 2 days. This significantly reduces the timeframe, making it potentially infeasible, especially if the confidential information is voluminous or stored across multiple systems. This could violate legal standards related to providing a reasonable time to comply with obligations regarding confidential information, particularly in regulated industries.",

                "original_text": "Any proposed response by a Party to a Customer Complaint shall be sent to the other Parties not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the response being sent to any person, including the Certificate Owner or any Governmental Entity, provided, however, that if a more prompt response is required, the Parties shall send to the other Parties the proposed response as soon as practicable under the circumstances but in no event shall any Party submit such response to another person without providing the other Party with prior written notice of and a copy of the response.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates a five-business-day notice period, which aligns with standard due diligence practices and allows for reasonable review. Reducing this to one business day may contravene regulatory expectations for thorough complaint handling and compliance in insurance, potentially conflicting with state-specific insurance regulations that necessitate a sufficient review period.",

The failure of the Indemnifying Party to give such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle or compromise such a claim shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnifying Party's rights under this Section 12.04.1 and shall preclude the Indemnifying Party from disputing the manner in which the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such claim or the reasonableness of any amount paid by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim.",
                "changed_text": "The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon notice to the Indemnified Party within two business days after the receipt of any such notice, to undertake the defense of or, with the consent of the Indemnified Party, (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), to settle or compromise such claim. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to give such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle or compromise such a claim shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnifying Party's rights under this Section 12.04.1 and shall preclude the Indemnifying Party from disputing the manner in which the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such claim or the reasonableness of any amount paid by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for assuming defense from ten to two business days creates a legal inconsistency. In complex litigation or regulatory claims, this abbreviated period may not provide sufficient time for a thorough investigation and assessment of the claim's merits, violating principles of due process. Certain jurisdictions mandate adequate time for insurers to investigate claims before assuming defense.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 120 days' notice for termination, providing stability and time for transition. Reducing this to 30 days creates an inconsistency with industry standards for winding down complex financial relationships, particularly those involving insurance products. It might conflict with requirements in certain states that mandate longer notice periods to protect policyholders and ensure orderly market conduct.",

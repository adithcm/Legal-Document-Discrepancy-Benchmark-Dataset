                "changed_text": "In the event Offshore is in Default under Section 7.1(f), (g),  (h) and/or (i) ofthe Credit Agreement, then Prime's warranty is limited to 10% of the outstanding loan amount, regardless of the actual costs for Project Completion.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a legal contradiction because it limits Prime's warranty to a fixed percentage of the outstanding loan amount, regardless of the actual costs for Project Completion. This limitation could potentially violate the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially if the actual costs significantly exceed the 10% limit, leaving Guaranty inadequately protected. Contract law requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in performing their contractual obligations, and this arbitrary limitation may be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable under Texas law.",

This required liquidity\"  win reduce dollar-for-dollar with any additional shareholder advance s and increase dollar-for-dollar to a maximum of $21,000,000 with any  repayment of shareholder advances.",
                "changed_text": "Prime will, during the term of the Credit Agreement, maintain liquidity consisting of unused revolver availability under the Credit Agreement dated December 1, 2002, and/or unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $5,000,000. This liquidity requirement may be waived at Guaranty's sole discretion without prior notice.",
                "explanation": "This change reduces the required liquidity from $25,000,000 to $5,000,000 and introduces a clause allowing Guaranty to waive this requirement at its sole discretion without prior notice. This creates a legal contradiction. Such a low liquidity threshold, coupled with the waiver clause, introduces an element of uncertainty and could be deemed an illusory promise, potentially unenforceable under Texas contract law because Prime's obligation becomes discretionary rather than binding. This could violate standard business practices where liquidity requirements are expected to be stable.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. Any disputes arising from this agreement must be resolved through binding arbitration in a location chosen solely by Guaranty.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces Texas law with Delaware law and mandates binding arbitration in a location chosen solely by Guaranty. This introduces a legal contradiction. The original agreement specifies Texas law, and unilaterally changing the governing law to Delaware, where Prime may have minimal connection, could be challenged as a violation of due process and the principle of reasonable relationship to the chosen jurisdiction. Furthermore, granting Guaranty the sole discretion to choose the arbitration location can be deemed unconscionable if it places an undue burden on Prime, contradicting basic principles of fairness in contract law.",

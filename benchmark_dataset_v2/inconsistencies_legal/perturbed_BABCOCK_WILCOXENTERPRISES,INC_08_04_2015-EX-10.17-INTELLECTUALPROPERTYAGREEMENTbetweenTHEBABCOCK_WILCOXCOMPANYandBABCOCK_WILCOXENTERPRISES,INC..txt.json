Without limiting the foregoing, within sixty (60) days from the Distribution Date, SpinCo will make all necessary filings and take all necessary actions, subject to all applicable local Laws, to amend the description of goods and services to remove referenced to nuclear subject matter from the registrations and applications for SpinCo House Marks listed on Schedule 3.3.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe for filings and actions related to amending trademark descriptions to 30 days creates a potential inconsistency. Depending on the complexity and volume of filings, this may not provide adequate time for compliance with trademark regulations.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the timeframe to 45 days might be insufficient for compliance with trademark regulations, especially if numerous trademarks are involved or complexities arise during the amendment process. This creates a legal contradiction.",

                "explanation": "Removing the specific timeframe creates uncertainty and could be interpreted as a violation of 'Good Faith and Fair Dealing' implied in many contracts. The original text created a timeline and safeguard to ensure it occurs within 30 days. The removal of that would delay response to SpinCo.",

                "original_text": "In the absence of a specific payment schedule, all payment terms are 30 days net from date of invoice.",
                "changed_text": "In the absence of a specific payment schedule, all payment terms are 90 days net from date of invoice.",
                "explanation": "Increasing the payment terms to 90 days could create inconsistency with standard commercial practices and potentially violate prompt payment laws in certain jurisdictions (including some U.S. states) that require faster payment timelines, especially for smaller businesses or specific industries. It may also contradict standard practice depending on the product or service provided within the US. Also, a court in the United States might deem this to be an unconscionable amount of time, because it may cause undue hardship for the business extending credit.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially violates prompt payment laws and unconscionability standards depending on jurisdiction and industry in the United States.",

                "original_text": "Both Parties agree that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following the termination, both Parties will not (i) solicit, encourage, or take any other action, which is intended, directly or indirectly, to induce any employee to terminate his or her employment with a Party; or (ii) interfere in any manner with the contractual or employment relationship between the Parties and any their employees.",
                "changed_text": "Both Parties agree that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months following the termination, both Parties will not (i) solicit, encourage, or take any other action, which is intended, directly or indirectly, to induce any employee to terminate his or her employment with a Party; or (ii) interfere in any manner with the contractual or employment relationship between the Parties and any their employees.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the non-solicitation period to six months following termination may be deemed unreasonably short, particularly for specialized roles. Some states find two years to be the acceptable outer limit, while others still find it to be unreasonable depending on the industry. Therefore, modifying the text to six months could create a conflict in states like Florida, where a longer restriction may be deemed reasonably necessary to protect legitimate business interests.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with Florida's statutes regarding reasonable non-solicitation agreement terms (Florida Statute § 542.335).",

                "explanation": "Increasing the notification time could cause legal and business problems. By changing it to 15 days, it directly affects the amount of time available to respond to a dispute, request for information, or general legal notification. Some states may require quicker times, and some legal disputes (such as a notice of foreclosure) require a short response time.",

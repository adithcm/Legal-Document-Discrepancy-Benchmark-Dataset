Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall survive the Second Amendment's expiration.",
                "changed_text": "This Second Amendment shall be effective from The Second Amendment Effective Date and shall expire on December 31, 2021. Upon expiration, this Second Amendment shall be of no further force or effect, and the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall as they were before the Second Amendment Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Party's right to enforce the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment shall immediately expire, without recourse, upon its expiration.",
                "explanation": "This change eliminates the survival clause for enforcing terms after the agreement expires. This contradicts the general principle of contract law that allows for enforcement of obligations that accrued during the contract term, even after the contract's expiration. In many jurisdictions, the statute of limitations allows parties time to bring claims for breaches that occurred during the contract term.",

Heritage holds sole discretion to change and alter product specifications as it deems necessary, overriding prior agreements. [***].",
                "explanation": "The change allows Heritage to unilaterally alter product specifications, overriding prior agreements.

Heritage can purchase ingredients and packaging materials as they seem fit to best produce a product, overriding previous agreements. [***].",
                "explanation": "This modification gives Heritage sole discretion over invoicing terms, contradicting the agreed-upon billing terms in Schedule C or C-1. Further, Heritage can purchase and do what it deems fit, thereby breaking agreements to specifications that were set previously. This can result in legal dispute about breach of contract and is unlikely to be viewed as a valid practice by courts.",

                "original_text": "5.Term of this Agreement\n\nThe term of this Agreement will commence on the date that the Affiliate Registration Form is approved by Chase and will end when terminated by either party. Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chase's Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may   terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "changed_text": "5.Term of this Agreement\n\nThe term of this Agreement will commence on the date that the Affiliate Registration Form is approved by Chase and will end when terminated by either party. Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, effective immediately upon oral notice to Affiliate. Affiliate may only terminate this agreement with 90 days written notice. At the time of termination, any links to Chase's Website must be removed immediately. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces an imbalance in termination rights that likely violates principles of contract law in many jurisdictions. Specifically, Chase can terminate immediately upon oral notice, while the Affiliate requires 90 days' written notice. Such a disparity in termination conditions could be deemed unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.",

Licenses and Use of the Chase Logos and Trademarks\n\nChase grants Affiliate a non-exclusive, nontransferable, revocable right to (a) access the Chase site through the links solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (b) solely in connection with such links, to use Chase's logos, trade names, trademarks, and similar identifying material relating to Chase (collectively, the \"Licensed Materials\"), for the sole purpose of booking Chase products. Prior to using any of the Licensed Materials, Affiliate will submit to Chase for approval a draft of all proposed material that incorporates the Licensed Materials, together with a brief statement setting forth the proposed use of such materials and any other background or supporting material reasonably requested by Chase to allow Chase to make an informed judgment. All such materials shall be submitted to Chase at least seven (7) days prior to the date of first intended use. Chase will notify Affiliate of its approval or disapproval of such materials within five (5) business days of its receipt of all information required to be submitted.",

                "explanation": "By removing the approval process and notification requirement, this change allows the Affiliate to use Chase's trademarks without any oversight.

IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO AFFILIATE, THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT.

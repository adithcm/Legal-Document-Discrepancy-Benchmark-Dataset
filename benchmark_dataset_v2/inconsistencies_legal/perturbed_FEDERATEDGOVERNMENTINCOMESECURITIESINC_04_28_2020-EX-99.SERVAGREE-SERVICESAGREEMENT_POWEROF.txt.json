                "original_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless FASC and its trustees, officers and employees (each of the foregoing an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively the \"Indemnified Parties\") against and from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or document executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, including without limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the exercise or performance of any of FASC's powers or duties under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with the exercise of the authority granted to FASC herein to act on behalf of the Adviser, or the taking of any action under or in connection with any of the foregoing. The obligations of the Adviser under this paragraph shall only survive the termination of this Limited Power of Attorney for a period of 30 days with respect to actions taken by FASC on behalf of the Adviser during the term of this Limited Power of Attorney.",
                "explanation": "By limiting the survival of indemnification obligations to only 30 days post-termination, this contradicts the typical expectation and potentially legal requirements for the duration of such obligations, especially in financial contexts where liabilities may arise years after the agreement ends. Pennsylvania law, governing this agreement, recognizes the validity of indemnification clauses, but their enforceability can be challenged if the duration is unreasonably short, potentially conflicting with the principle of adequate protection for the Indemnified Party.",

                "explanation": "By excluding the Pennsylvania Uniform Fiduciary Act, the contract attempts to bypass statutory regulations governing the conduct of fiduciaries. This could lead to a conflict with Pennsylvania law, which mandates certain standards of care and loyalty for agents acting on behalf of others, potentially voiding or rendering unenforceable provisions of the agreement that deviate from these fiduciary obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or terminated by the Adviser at any time, and such revocation or termination shall be effective immediately upon the Adviser's decision, regardless of whether FASC has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in writing from the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "Making the revocation effective immediately, regardless of written notice, creates a potential conflict with agency law principles requiring adequate notice to the agent (FASC) for termination of authority. Pennsylvania law typically requires reasonable notification to prevent the agent from continuing to act under the revoked authority, which could lead to liability for the principal (Adviser).",

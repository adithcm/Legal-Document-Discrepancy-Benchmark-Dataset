Upon receipt of each Deliverable, On2 shall have a period of thirty (30) working days within which to inspect such Deliverable based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\"). Should On2 find that any Deliverable does not substantially conform to the relevant Specification, On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing, which notice shall provide sufficiently detailed explanation of the non-conformities so as to allow Wildform to reproduce them (any such notice is referred to herein as a \"Nonconformance Notice\"). Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable.",

Upon receipt of each Deliverable, On2 shall have a period of ten (10) working days within which to inspect such Deliverable based upon the relevant Specification (an \"Acceptance Period\").

For purposes of the response times set forth below a \"Serious\" Program Error shall be defined as a Program Error that (a) causes the Deliverables to crash (malfunction), or (b) substantially degrades the performance, usability or appearance of the Deliverables.

                "explanation": "Altering the response and correction times for program errors to be significantly longer (serious errors now take 30 days instead of 8, minor errors now take 60 days instead of 15). This could be considered a breach of contract or a failure to provide adequate support, especially if industry standards dictate faster resolution times or the delay causes significant business disruption to On2. It also makes correction times not guaranteed, thus rendering Wildform blameless regardless of whether or not they are actually providing commercially reasonable efforts to correct Program Errors.",

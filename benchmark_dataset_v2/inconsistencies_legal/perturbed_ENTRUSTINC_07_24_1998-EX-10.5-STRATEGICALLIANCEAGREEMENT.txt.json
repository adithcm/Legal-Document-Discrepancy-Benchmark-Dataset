In the event of any material breach of this ---------------------- Agreement by either Nortel or Entrust, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by giving sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not terminate if the other Party has cured the breach prior to the expiration of such 60-day period, or if such breach can not be cured within such sixty 60-day period, the other Party has initiated actions to cure such breach within such sixty 60-day period, and thereafter cures such breach as soon as reasonably practical.",
                "changed_text": "Section 10.02. Termination. -----------\n(a) Termination for Cause. In the event of any material breach of this ---------------------- Agreement by either Nortel or Entrust, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by giving ten (10) days' prior written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not terminate if the other Party has cured the breach prior to the expiration of such 10-day period, or if such breach can not be cured within such 10-day period, the other Party has initiated actions to cure such breach within such 10-day period, and thereafter cures such breach as soon as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination due to a material breach from 60 days to 10 days could be problematic. While contract law generally allows parties to agree on termination notice periods, unreasonably short periods might be challenged, especially if one party is significantly disadvantaged. Some jurisdictions may require a 'reasonable' notice period based on the complexity of the agreement and the potential harm caused by abrupt termination. Depending on the province in Canada, a 10-day notice may not be considered reasonable, especially if it involves complex technology transfer and licensing agreements. This could be deemed a breach of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract law; potential violation of reasonable notice requirements depending on jurisdictional interpretation.",

                "explanation": "Specifying North Korean law is likely unenforceable and against public policy, especially given the nature of the agreement. Canadian courts would likely refuse to enforce this clause due to fundamental differences in legal systems and principles.",

THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ------ -- ---- ----- ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. This waiver applies even in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct by either party.",
                "explanation": "Extending the jury waiver to include 'gross negligence or willful misconduct' might be problematic. While jury waivers are generally enforceable, some jurisdictions may scrutinize waivers that cover intentional or grossly negligent acts. A court may find that such an expansive waiver is unconscionable or violates public policy, particularly if it significantly disadvantages one party.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any  material breach of this Agreement by either Nortel or Entrust, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by giving sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not terminate if the other Party has cured the breach prior to the expiration of such 60-day period, or if such breach can not be cured within such sixty 60-day period,\nthe other Party has initiated actions to cure such breach within such sixty 60-day period, and thereafter cures such breach as soon as reasonably practical.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any  material breach of this Agreement by either Nortel or Entrust, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by giving ten (10) days' prior written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not terminate if the other Party has cured the breach prior to the expiration of such 10-day period, or if such breach can not be cured within such ten 10-day period,\nthe other Party has initiated actions to cure such breach within such ten 10-day period, and thereafter cures such breach as soon as reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows a 60-day notice period for termination due to a material breach. Reducing this to 10 days may be inconsistent with laws or regulations that require longer notice periods to allow sufficient time to remedy a breach, particularly in complex commercial agreements. In some jurisdictions, a 60-day cure period is seen as commercially reasonable, while a 10-day period could be deemed insufficient.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement allows for a longer term or until a specific event. Shortening the term to just one year may contradict laws related to the reasonable duration of contracts or industry standards for similar strategic alliances, especially if substantial investments or ongoing obligations are involved. A one-year term may be considered unconscionably short, depending on the context of the agreement and applicable legal precedents.",

                "changed_text": "All notices authorized or required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be given via carrier pigeon, addressed to the Party at the following addresses.",
                "explanation": "The original clause lists acceptable methods for delivering notices (personal delivery, delivery service with receipt, registered/certified mail, telecopier). Replacing these with 'carrier pigeon' is not a legally recognized or reliable method of delivering official notices, making it inconsistent with standard contract law requirements for providing adequate and verifiable notice. This is not a reasonable method of correspondence in the 21st century. This is especially an important contradiction as the document indicates that the governing law is the province of Ontario, Canada.",

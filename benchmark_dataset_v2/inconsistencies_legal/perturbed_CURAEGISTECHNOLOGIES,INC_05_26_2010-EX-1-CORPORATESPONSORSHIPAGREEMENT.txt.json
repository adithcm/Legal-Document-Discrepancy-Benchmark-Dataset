                "original_text": "Any materials using Trademarks which are  submitted to one party by the other are deemed to be approved if the receiving party has not disapproved the material in writing within ten (10)  business days after it receives a request for approval. The parties shall not unreasonably disapprove any material. If any material is disapproved  by one party, it will advise the other of the specific reasons for the disapproval.",
                "changed_text": "Any materials using Trademarks which are  submitted to one party by the other are deemed to be approved if the receiving party has not disapproved the material in writing within three (3) business days after it receives a request for approval. The parties maintain complete discretion in approving or disapproving any material. If any material is disapproved  by one party, it is not required to advise the other of the specific reasons for the disapproval.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a 10-day approval window for trademark usage, and requires a reasonable explanation for disapproval. Reducing the approval window to 3 days is unreasonably short and conflicts with standard business practice and could be seen as a breach of good faith. Removing the 'reasonableness' requirement gives one party arbitrary power and removes the obligation to provide justifications for disapproval, potentially hindering trademark usage and conflicting with implied duties of fair dealing present in contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Either party may change its address for notice by verbally informing the other party.",
                "explanation": "The original contract requires written notice for address changes. This change allows for verbal notification which contradicts standard legal practices for contract modifications and notice requirements. Verbal notice could lead to disputes regarding receipt or content of the notice and is generally insufficient for legal purposes.",

                "explanation": "The original clause requires any amendments or waivers to be in writing. This modification allows for oral amendments and waivers based on conduct. This directly contradicts the original clause and violates the Statute of Frauds (depending on the subject matter of the contract and applicable state law) which requires certain agreements, including those not performable within one year or involving the sale of goods above a certain value, to be in writing.",

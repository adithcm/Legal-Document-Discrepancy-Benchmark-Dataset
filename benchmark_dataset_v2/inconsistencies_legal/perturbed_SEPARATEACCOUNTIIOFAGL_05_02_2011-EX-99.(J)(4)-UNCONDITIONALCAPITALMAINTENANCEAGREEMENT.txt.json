Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such sale.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination to 5 days may be deemed unreasonable and could potentially conflict with general principles of contract law that require sufficient notice for termination, especially in agreements involving substantial capital maintenance and ongoing financial obligations. Courts often look to what constitutes a 'reasonable' notice period, and 5 days may be considered insufficient, potentially leading to legal challenges regarding the validity of the termination clause, since Delaware may need a 30 day notice.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the compliance period for AIG from 60 days to 15 days is an inconsistency because it might violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to a contract to act honestly and reasonably. Fifteen days might be insufficient for AIG to fully investigate the policyholder's complaint and take appropriate corrective action, which could be deemed unreasonable. It also potentially interferes with Delaware's regulatory oversight of insurance companies, potentially leading to conflict in the policyholder recourse timelines.",

                "original_text": "The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under        paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per        year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business        day after the filing of the Company's first fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business        day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and        (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing        of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements        and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's        fourth fiscal quarter.",
                "changed_text": "The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under paragraph 1 will take place within the following time period: contributions by AIG, if deemed necessary, shall be made at AIG's convenience. The specific timing will be determined solely at AIG's discretion and without any fixed schedule.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the specific timelines for capital contributions, giving AIG complete discretion. This contradicts insurance regulations in Delaware, which requires financial solvency and timely capital maintenance. Insurance regulators may consider AIG's open-ended commitment a violation of capital maintenance standards and create inconsistencies with regulatory expectations for scheduled capital injections.",

Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally        recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to        the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the        Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such        agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale        by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with        the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of        S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally        recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal        to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date        immediately preceding such sale.",
                "changed_text": "AIG shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination. AIG may terminate this agreement at will for any reason.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period to five days and removing conditions for termination contradicts the implicit regulatory expectations for stability and predictability in capital maintenance agreements within the insurance sector. A sudden termination without cause could potentially undermine the Company's financial stability, leading to regulatory concerns.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that policyholders must give AIG 60 days to comply with the agreement before taking action. Shortening that compliance period to 15 days might not provide AIG enough time to address the concerns, potentially increasing litigation risks for policyholders and creating issues with 'good faith' requirements in legal proceedings.",

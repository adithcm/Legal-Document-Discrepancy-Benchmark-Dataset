                "original_text": "b. Distributor agrees that during the term of this agreement it meet the minimum performance goals set forth in Exhibit C to this agreement. Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall, at Erchonia's option (i) be considered a breach of this agreement for which Erchonia shall have all the rights and remedies provided for herein upon a breach of this agreement, including termination of this agreement, or (ii) shall give Erchonia to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement",
                "changed_text": "b. Distributor agrees that during the term of this agreement it meet the minimum performance goals set forth in Exhibit C to this agreement. Failure to meet these minimum performance goals for any period, shall, at Erchonia's option (i) be considered a breach of this agreement for which Erchonia shall have all the rights and remedies provided for herein upon a breach of this agreement, including immediate termination of this agreement, or (ii) shall give Erchonia to terminate or limit the exclusivity provisions of this agreement, effective immediately upon notice.",
                "explanation": "This modification allows Erchonia to immediately terminate the agreement upon failure to meet minimum performance goals, without providing a cure period. This contradicts standard contract law principles and may violate state laws that require a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination, especially considering the agreement is governed by Florida law which generally favors providing a chance to cure.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of Contract - Florida law requires a reasonable opportunity to cure a breach before termination unless explicitly waived.",

                "original_text": "b. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within ten days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "changed_text": "b. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, provided the breaching party is first given reasonably detailed, written notice of the breach. If the breach is not cured within three days of such notice, the Agreement will terminate immediately.",
                "explanation": "The modification reduces the cure period for a material breach from ten days to three days. This could be deemed unreasonably short under Florida law, especially for complex breaches that require more time to rectify, potentially making the termination clause unenforceable.",

                "changed_text": "b. Distributor shall pay half (1/2) of the purchase price prior to shipment and the remaining balance 10 days after shipment of the Products. Payments received after the 10 day calendar period will be subject to a late fee of 10% of the invoice amount, compounded daily.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly shortens the payment period to 10 days and imposes an exorbitant late fee of 10% compounded daily. This late fee could be considered usurious or an unconscionable penalty under Florida law, which disallows excessively high late payment fees, making it potentially unenforceable.",

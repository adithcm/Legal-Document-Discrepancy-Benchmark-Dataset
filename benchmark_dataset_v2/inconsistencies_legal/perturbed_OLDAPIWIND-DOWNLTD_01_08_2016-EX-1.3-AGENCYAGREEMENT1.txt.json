                "original_text": "The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 24 months at the Offering Price.",
                "changed_text": "The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 6 months at the Offering Price.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict with standard option agreements, which often have longer exercise periods to provide value to the option holders. A six-month period may be deemed unreasonably short, potentially violating regulations related to fair compensation or creating issues under securities law concerning equitable treatment of investors, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. This may contradict principles of good faith and fair dealing, which are implied in most contracts.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of securities laws or regulations concerning fair compensation, depending on jurisdiction.",
                "location": "Paragraph 1"

                "original_text": "Each notice shall be personally delivered to the addressee or sent by fax or e-mail to the addressee. A notice which is personally delivered or delivered by fax or e-mail shall, if delivered prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on a Business Day, be deemed to be given and received on that day and, in any other case, be deemed to be given and received on the first Business Day following the day on which it is delivered.",
                "changed_text": "Each notice shall be sent via carrier pigeon to the addressee. A notice via carrier pigeon shall be deemed to be given and received 10 days from the date of dispatch.",
                "explanation": "The modified text mandates notification via carrier pigeon, an outdated and unreliable method. This contradicts the established legal standards for reasonable notification methods, which typically include electronic or postal delivery services. The 10-day receipt period regardless of actual delivery also conflicts with requirements for timely notice in legal and contractual contexts. Modern legal standards require methods of communication that provide proof of delivery and receipt, which carrier pigeons cannot provide.",

                "original_text": "The Agents shall have received at the Closing Time an opinion of U.S. counsel to the Corporation, Troutman Sanders LLP, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, acting reasonably, to the effect that the offer and sale of the Offered Shares in the United States do not require registration under the U.S. Securities Act.",
                "changed_text": "The Agents shall accept a signed declaration from the Corporation's CEO as sufficient evidence that the offer and sale of the Offered Shares in the United States do not require registration under the U.S. Securities Act.",
                "explanation": "This change substitutes the legal opinion of U.S. counsel with a signed declaration from the Corporation's CEO. This is legally problematic because it circumvents the due diligence required to ensure compliance with U.S. securities laws. A CEO's declaration lacks the legal expertise and independent verification needed to determine the validity of a securities offering's exemption from registration, potentially violating U.S. Securities Act regulations.",
                "contradicted_law": "Violates due diligence requirements under the U.S. Securities Act and may conflict with requirements for qualified legal opinions in securities offerings.",

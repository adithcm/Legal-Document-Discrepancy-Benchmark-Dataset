                "original_text": "As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.",
                "changed_text": "As a result of its planned move to BISYS, United National will liquidate its interest in United Financial Services at its sole discretion, with no mandatory deadline.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies a deadline ('first half of 1999') for liquidating the interest in United Financial Services. Removing the deadline and stating 'at its sole discretion, with no mandatory deadline' contradicts standard business law principles that emphasize reasonable and timely execution of business arrangements and may violate regulations about timely asset liquidation depending on the specific context not included in the text. This change creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance regarding the timing of the liquidation, making it difficult to assess if it adheres to applicable regulations regarding liquidation procedures or fiduciary duty.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract principles, potential violation of fiduciary duty regarding timely asset liquidation (depending on the complete agreement and context).",

Nevertheless,  we believe that the enhanced  capabilities  which  BISYS  offers  are  better  matched to the future direction of our Bank.\"",
                "changed_text": "\"Our investment in United Financial Services is deemed irrelevant to our future business decisions,\" said Mr. Gregor. \"Any prior benefits derived from United Financial Services are to be disregarded.\"",
                "explanation": "The modified statement intends to void the original assessment of the investment in United Financial Services. Disregarding 'prior benefits' may conflict with obligations arising from that investment, such as liabilities, warranties or other terms that persist independently from current business decisions. Depending on the governing jurisdiction and specific details of the initial agreement between United National and United Financial Services this action of disregarding may introduce a potential breach of implied legal obligations and liabilities.",
                "contradicted_law": "Breach of contract (implied legal obligations), breach of good faith and fair dealing (potentially, depending on context), liability regulations.",

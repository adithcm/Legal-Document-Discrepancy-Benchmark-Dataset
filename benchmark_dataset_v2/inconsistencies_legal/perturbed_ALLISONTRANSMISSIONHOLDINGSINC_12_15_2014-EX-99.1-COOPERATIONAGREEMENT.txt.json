                "original_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the written opinion of outside legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties.",
                "changed_text": "(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the opinion of in-house legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties.",
                "explanation": "Changing the appointment timeframe from ten days to thirty and changing the requirement of 'outside legal counsel' to 'in-house legal counsel' to assess potential fiduciary breach introduces a legal contradiction. While a longer timeframe isn't inherently illegal, it weakens the agreement's enforceability by providing more leeway and also, using in-house legal counsel may raise questions about the impartiality of the opinion, potentially conflicting with the requirement for independent judgment in fiduciary matters. If the original contract stipulates that an 'outside legal counsel' will give an opinion, then the new language violates the clause in the original document. This violates general corporate law principles regarding fiduciary duties and the need for impartial legal advice.",

                "original_text": "So long as the ValueAct Group collectively beneficially owns, in the aggregate, at least 7.5% of the outstanding Common Stock, if, during the Covered Period, a vacancy on the Board is created as a result of the ValueAct Designee's death, resignation, disqualification or removal, then the ValueAct Group and the Company (acting through the Board) shall work together in good faith to fill such vacancy or replace such nominee with an individual who (A) meets the Conditions, (B) meets the historical standards and criteria applied by the Company in nominating and appointing directors, and (C) is otherwise mutually acceptable (in each of their sole discretion) to the ValueAct Group and the Company, and thereafter such individual shall serve and/or be nominated as the \"ValueAct Designee\" under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "So long as the ValueAct Group collectively beneficially owns, in the aggregate, at least 2% of the outstanding Common Stock, if, during the Covered Period, a vacancy on the Board is created as a result of the ValueAct Designee's death, resignation, disqualification or removal, then the ValueAct Group alone can choose to fill such vacancy with an individual who (A) meets the Conditions. After such selection, the individual shall serve and/or be nominated as the \"ValueAct Designee\" under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Lowering the ownership threshold to 2% and removing the Company's mutual approval right for a replacement director conflicts with corporate governance norms and potentially Delaware law (where the company is incorporated, as stated in Section 9). Delaware law emphasizes board independence and fiduciary duties to all shareholders. Allowing a minority shareholder (2% ownership) to unilaterally appoint a director raises concerns about undue influence and potential breaches of fiduciary duty to other shareholders. A board vacancy requires mutual consent and not a single party to fill. This can make the agreement unenforceable under Delaware law.",

                "original_text": "The ValueAct Group acknowledges that the ValueAct Designee shall have all of the rights and obligations, including fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders, of a director under applicable law and the Company's organizational documents while the ValueAct Designee is serving on the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2 shall limit any actions that may be taken by the ValueAct Designee acting solely as a director of the Company consistent with his fiduciary duties as a director of the Company (it being understood and agreed that the ValueAct Group and the ValueAct Affiliates shall not seek to do indirectly through the ValueAct Designee anything that would be prohibited if done by the ValueAct Group or the ValueAct Affiliates).",

                "explanation": "The modified clause directly contradicts the fiduciary duties owed by a director to the company and all its shareholders. Explicitly stating that the ValueAct Designee 'shall primarily represent the interests of the ValueAct Group' and allowing the ValueAct Group to do indirectly what they can't directly, violates the director's duty of loyalty and good faith under Delaware law. Directors must act in the best interests of the corporation, not a specific shareholder group. This change would make the agreement unenforceable and expose the ValueAct Designee and the ValueAct Group to potential legal challenges for breach of fiduciary duty.",

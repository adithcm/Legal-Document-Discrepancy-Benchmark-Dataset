                "original_text": "All subsequent monthly payments of Base Consulting Fee shall be paid within the first five days of the following calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "All subsequent monthly payments of Base Consulting Fee shall be paid within 45 days of the following calendar month.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts wage payment laws in many states, including New York (specified in the contract's governing law clause), which generally require more frequent payment of wages. Delaying payment up to 45 days violates these regulations, potentially leading to penalties and legal action.",

                "original_text": "(ii) Without Cause. The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time by giving Consultant 60 days prior written Notice of the termination. In such case, 100% of the Consultant's unvested stock and, if applicable, option or warrant compensation of any nature will vest without any further action required on the part of the Consultant or the Company and the Company will deliver to the order of the Consultant promptly upon receipt of a written demand of the Consultant such shares of common stock or options at its sole expense as become due to Consultant hereunder. The Consultant's right to receive compensation whether in cash or securities shall survive any termination of this Agreement Without Cause.",
                "changed_text": "(ii) Without Cause. The Company may terminate Consultant's engagement at any time by giving Consultant 14 days prior written Notice of the termination. In such case, all unvested stock and, if applicable, option or warrant compensation of any nature will be immediately forfeited. The Consultant's right to receive compensation whether in cash or securities shall be immediately terminated.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination without cause to 14 days and forfeiting all unvested compensation directly contradicts standard contract law principles and potentially applicable labor laws. Such short notice could be deemed unreasonable, and immediate forfeiture of vested benefits may be unlawful, particularly if it violates established vesting schedules or implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "If the Company proposes at any time (a) to declare any dividend or distribution upon any of its stock, whether in cash, property, stock, or other securities and whether or not a regular cash dividend; (b) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of any of its stock; or (c) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease, license, or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, then, in connection with each such event, the Company shall give Holder: (1) at least three (3) days prior written notice of the date on which a record will be taken for such dividend, distribution, or subscription rights (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock will be entitled thereto) or for determining rights to vote, if any, in respect of the matters referred to in (a) above; and (2) in the case of the matters referred to in (b) and (c) above at least three (3) days prior written notice of the date when the same will take place (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the occurrence of such event).",
                "changed_text": "If the Company proposes at any time (a) to declare any dividend or distribution upon any of its stock, whether in cash, property, stock, or other securities and whether or not a regular cash dividend; (b) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of any of its stock; or (c) to merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation, or sell, lease, license, or convey all or substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, then, in connection with each such event, the Company may, at its sole discretion, provide notice to the Holder. The timing and content of such notice, if provided, shall be determined by the Company.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the mandatory notice requirement for significant corporate events and replaces it with discretionary notice. This could conflict with securities regulations or fiduciary duties if the Holder has rights tied to these events (e.g., warrant adjustments), potentially violating disclosure requirements designed to protect investors. The original text provided minimal protection, but the changed text removes it entirely, creating a legal inconsistency.",

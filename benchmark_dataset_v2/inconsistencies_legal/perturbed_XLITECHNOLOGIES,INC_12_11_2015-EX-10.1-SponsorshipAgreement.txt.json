                "original_text": "Any termination allowed by this Agreement will take place only after written notice of default has been given to the defaulting party, providing such party with thirty (30) days in which to cure the default.",
                "changed_text": "Any termination allowed by this Agreement will take place only after written notice of default has been given to the defaulting party, providing such party with ten (10) days in which to cure the default.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period to ten (10) days may conflict with state laws that require a longer cure period for certain types of contract breaches. For example, in California, certain commercial leases require a 30-day notice period to cure a breach.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potentially conflicts with California law regarding commercial lease agreements and other state-specific contract laws requiring longer cure periods.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the email acknowledgement to 1 business day may be too short if the recipient is out of office or otherwise unable to promptly reply. Increasing the acknowledgement for the US Mail may cause issues with compliance with legal deadlines.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the insurance coverage period to thirty (30) days after the agreement terminates may not comply with insurance requirements for ongoing liabilities or potential claims that could arise after the agreement ends. Many insurance policies require a longer coverage period to address latent defects or claims made after the project is completed. Depending on the scope of work, this could violate standard business practices and potentially expose parties to uncovered liabilities.",

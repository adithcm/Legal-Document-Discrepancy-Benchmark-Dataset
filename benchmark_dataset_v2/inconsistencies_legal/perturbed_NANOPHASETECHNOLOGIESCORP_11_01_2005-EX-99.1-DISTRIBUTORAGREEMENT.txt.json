                "original_text": "4.3 NTC shall invoice ALFA AESAR for payment of Products delivered to ALFA AESAR on a Net 30 day basis. Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 1% per month or may be offset against any balances owed by NTC to ALFA AESAR. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any disputed invoice. In the event such efforts do not resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days, either party may initiate Arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 16.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 NTC shall invoice ALFA AESAR for payment of Products delivered to ALFA AESAR on a Net 90 day basis. Excepting any amounts disputed in good faith, balances unpaid after such period will be subject to a finance charge of 5% per month. The parties agree to resolve any disputed invoice at their earliest convenience. In the event such efforts do not resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may initiate Arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 16.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces multiple inconsistencies. First, extending the payment term to 'Net 90 day basis' from 'Net 30 day basis', may violates the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/2-310) as standard industry practice and reasonable time for payment can often be less than 90 days, especially if this is not aligned with the standard industry payment terms for similar goods. Second, increasing the finance charge to 5% per month, from 1% per month exceeds what is legally permissible under Illinois law without proper disclosure and agreement, which could be viewed as usurious under 815 ILCS 205/4. Additionally, reducing the dispute resolution period to thirty (30) days may not allow sufficient time to work in good faith to resolve the dispute, potentially violating fairness and good faith principles in contract law. These modifications may impose unreasonable financial burdens and procedural constraints on ALFA AESAR.",

                "original_text": "6.3 NTC shall maintain adequate records of its invoices and accounting records reflecting all such sales in accordance with standard accounting principles. Within twelve (12) months after the date this Agreement has been terminated by the parties, ALFA AESAR may engage an independent certified public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to NTC to audit the NTC invoices and accounting records pertaining to those customers identified as referrals under Section 6.1 at NTC's offices during normal business hours by providing thirty (30) days advance notice of such audit for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the commissions paid or payable to ALFA AESAR hereunder. NTC shall promptly pay ALFA AESAR for any deficiencies between the commission earned and the commission paid to ALFA AESAR.",
                "changed_text": "6.3 NTC shall maintain adequate records of its invoices and accounting records reflecting all such sales in accordance with its internal accounting policies. ALFA AESAR may not engage any independent accounting firm to audit the NTC invoices and accounting records. Payment of commissions is at the sole discretion of NTC.",
                "explanation": "This modification completely eliminates ALFA AESAR's right to audit NTC's records, and changes the standard accounting principle to its internal accounting policies, which may be not align with the standard accounting principles, for the sales and commissions under Section 6.1. This also denies ALFA AESAR the ability to verify the accuracy of commissions paid, potentially violating general principles of transparency and fair dealing, and possibly the Illinois Sales Representative Act (820 ILCS 120/2) if ALFA AESAR is considered a sales representative under the law, by not allowing to audit.",

If substantial efforts to cure the breach are not taken within the sixty (60) day notice period, the non-breaching party may, at its sole discretion, terminate the agreement.",

If efforts to cure the breach are not completed within the fifteen (15) day notice period, the non-breaching party may, at its sole discretion, terminate the agreement.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for non-renewal from 6 months to 1 week is commercially unreasonable and contradicts common business practices, potentially violating the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. It may be deemed unconscionable in Illinois if it creates undue hardship for the distributor to wind down operations or find alternative suppliers. Furthermore, reducing the cure period for a material breach from 60 days to 15 days is also likely commercially unreasonable, and could be argued as insufficient time to rectify significant breaches, potentially exposing the breaching party to premature termination without reasonable opportunity for correction.",

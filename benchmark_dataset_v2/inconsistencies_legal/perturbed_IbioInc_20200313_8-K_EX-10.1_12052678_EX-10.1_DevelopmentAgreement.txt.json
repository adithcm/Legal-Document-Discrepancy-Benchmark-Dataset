                "original_text": "6.3 If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless: (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice has been cured within the thirty (30) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requires more than thirty (30) days to correct, and the breaching Party has begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the thirty (30) day notice period and diligently pursues such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless sixty (60) days has expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "changed_text": "6.3 If either Party to this Agreement fails to perform or violates any material obligation of this Agreement, then, upon ten (10) days written notice to the breaching Party specifying such failure or violation, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement without liability, unless: (a) the failure or violation specified in the default notice has been cured within the ten (10) day notice period; or (b) the failure or violation reasonably requires more than ten (10) days to correct, and the breaching Party has begun substantial corrective action to remedy the failure or violation within the ten (10) day notice period and diligently pursues such action, in which event, termination shall not be effective unless fifteen (15) days has expired from the date of the default notice without such corrective action being completed and the failure or violation remedied.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice and cure periods to 10 and 15 days respectively may conflict with what is considered a reasonable period under Texas law (governing law as stated in 9.13) for curing a material breach, especially given the complexity of the agreement and the nature of the joint development project. Courts often consider the specific facts and circumstances when determining reasonableness; a shorter period could be deemed insufficient and therefore unenforceable.",

                "original_text": "7.3 Each of the parties agrees that for five (5) years from the date of disclosure, the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information to those of the receiving party's employees and contractors, and employees and contractors of its Subsidiaries, who have a need to know it, and the receiving Party agrees to use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination outside of those employees and contractors as the receiving Party does with similar information of its own which it does not desire to publish, disclose or disseminate.",
                "changed_text": "7.3 Each of the parties agrees that for one (1) year from the date of disclosure, the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information to only the receiving party's senior executives, and the receiving Party agrees to use minimal care to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination outside of those senior executives.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period from five years to one year, limiting the disclosure to senior executives only, and stating the receiving party will use 'minimal care' contradicts typical standards of reasonable protection for trade secrets and confidential information under Texas law (Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act). This significantly weakens the protection afforded to confidential information, potentially rendering the clause unenforceable or exposing the receiving party to liability for misappropriation if they fail to adequately protect the information.",

                "original_text": "4.3 Each Party shall promptly provide to the other Party a written invention disclosure of each Agreement Invention made by its employees that results directly from the present Agreement for worked performed under the SOWs herein. The other Party agrees to delay making public, by publication or otherwise, until the earlier of (a) the first filing of a patent application claiming the Agreement Invention by the Inventing Party; or (b) six months after the date the Agreement Invention is disclosed to the other Party; or (c) mutual agreement of the Parties that neither will pursue legal protection of an Agreement Invention.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 Each Party may, at its sole discretion, provide to the other Party a written invention disclosure of each Agreement Invention made by its employees. The other Party agrees to delay making public, by publication or otherwise, until the earlier of (a) the first filing of a patent application claiming the Agreement Invention by the Inventing Party; or (b) one month after the date the Agreement Invention is disclosed to the other Party; or (c) notification by the disclosing party of their intent to abandon any further claims to the legal protection of an Agreement Invention.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall promptly provide' to 'may, at its sole discretion, provide' makes the disclosure of inventions optional, creating a contradiction to standard IP protection practices and potentially violating the duty of good faith and fair dealing, implied in Texas contract law, particularly in a joint development agreement where collaboration and information sharing are key. Shortening the delay period before publication from six months to one month reduces the time for the other party to assess the invention and potentially seek its own protection, prejudicing their interests and contradicting the collaborative spirit of the agreement.",

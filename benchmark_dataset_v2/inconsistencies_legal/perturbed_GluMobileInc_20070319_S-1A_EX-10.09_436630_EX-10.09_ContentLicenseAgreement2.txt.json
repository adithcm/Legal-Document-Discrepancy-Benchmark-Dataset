                "changed_text": "Licensee's term of exclusivity with respect to the KOH Video Clips shall expire on October 29, 2005, and Licensee's right and license to distribute the KOH Video Clips shall expire six (6) months after the initial theatrical release of the Property \"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN\".",
                "explanation": "Reducing the distribution period for video clips to 6 months could be problematic if it conflicts with standard distribution agreements or minimum terms required by certain digital distribution platforms or content protection laws, thereby creating a legal contradiction by imposing an unreasonably short term for exploitation rights. For example, some jurisdictions may have consumer protection laws that implicitly require a reasonable distribution window to allow consumers adequate access to purchased content, depending on the nature of the product.",

                "explanation": "Increasing the Distribution Fee to 99% of Fox's Gross Receipts could be seen as unconscionable or a violation of good faith and fair dealing, effectively depriving Licensee of any meaningful revenue from direct-to-consumer distribution. This potentially contradicts contract law principles requiring fairness and preventing undue exploitation of one party by another.",

However, Fox reserves the right to pursue claims against Licensee for any alleged breaches of contract occurring prior to this Amendment, provided that Fox notifies Licensee of such claims within one (1) day of the date of this Amendment.",
                "explanation": "Introducing a one-day notification period for pre-existing claims creates an unreasonable and potentially unenforceable deadline. This conflicts with standard statutes of limitations for breach of contract claims, which typically allow for a significantly longer period (e.g., several years) to discover and pursue legal action. The exceptionally short notification period effectively nullifies Licensee's right to defend against such claims adequately.",

                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Payment of the Royalty shall be made no later than 45 days after the termination of the preceding full calendar quarter.",
                "changed_text": "Payment of the Royalty shall be made no later than 90 days after the termination of the preceding full calendar quarter.",
                "explanation": "This change increases the payment timeframe for royalties to 90 days. Many states have laws mandating quicker payment schedules for contractors/freelancers, and delaying payment beyond a reasonable timeframe (often 30 days) can be a violation of wage and payment laws. Since the contract is between a Nevada Corporation and an individual in Virginia, the prompt payment laws of either state could be violated.",

                "original_text": "In this regarding, within thirty (30) days from the execution of this Agreement, Bizzingo will secure an insurance policy with limits of $5,000,000 per event and $ 5,000,000 umbrella, naming Theismann as an additional insured, covering the losses and claims stated in this sub-paragraph d.",
                "changed_text": "In this regarding, within ninety (90) days from the execution of this Agreement, Bizzingo will secure an insurance policy with limits of $5,000 per event and $ 5,000 umbrella, naming Theismann as an additional insured, covering the losses and claims stated in this sub-paragraph d.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation modifies two elements within the original text. Firstly, it extends the period to secure insurance from 30 days to 90 days, which may not be compliant with standard business practice. Secondly, it significantly decreases the insurance coverage amounts, introducing financial risk. These changes are legally inconsistent, because while an insurance policy is secured, the level of coverage may not adequately safeguard Theismann from potential financial risks, failing to provide him with reasonable protection which may violate duty of care or reasonable business standards.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "All books and records relative to Bizzingo's obligations hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to Theismann for inspection at a location in the United States for at least one year after termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "All books and records relative to Bizzingo's obligations hereunder shall be maintained and made accessible to Theismann for inspection at a location in the United States for at least six months after termination of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This perturbation shortens the period to maintain and keep books and records accessible to Theismann for inspection from one year to six months, which doesn't meet standard audit safety harbor regulations and accounting requirements. Depending on applicable state laws concerning record keeping for royalty payments and potential disputes, a six-month period may be insufficient and thus a violation.",
                "contradicted_law": "Potential violation of state laws concerning business record retention requirements.",

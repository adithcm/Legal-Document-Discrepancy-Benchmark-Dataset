This introduces a delay that could potentially violate FDA regulations or standard practices for NDA transfers, which often require prompt notification.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the provision of sales reports within 10 days of the month's end. This is modified to 45 days.

Reducing this period to one business day may not provide sufficient time for review, potentially leading to trademark misuse or unapproved materials, creating a conflict of laws depending on the state.",

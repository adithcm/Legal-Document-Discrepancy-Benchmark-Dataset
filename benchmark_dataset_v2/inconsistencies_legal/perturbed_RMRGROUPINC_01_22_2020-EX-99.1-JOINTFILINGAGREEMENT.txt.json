                "original_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of each of us pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. January 22, 2020 (Date)",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned hereby agree that the Schedule 13G/A with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of The RMR Group Inc., dated as of December 31, 2019, is, and any amendments thereto (including amendments on Schedule 13D) signed by each of the undersigned shall be, filed on behalf of only one of us, as chosen at our discretion, pursuant to provisions of Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. January 22, 2020 (Date)",
                "explanation": "Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that the filing be done on behalf of *each* person on whose behalf the filing is made. Allowing the filing to be done only for 'one of us, as chosen at our discretion' directly violates the requirement for a joint filing agreement to bind all parties to the filing responsibilities.",

                "explanation": "The change replaces Adam D. Portnoy's signature with \"Unauthorized Person\", while still keeping his name and title. This indicates a potential lack of proper authorization for the filing. Under securities law, proper authorization and signature are crucial for the validity of legal filings. A signature by an unauthorized person would be a legal contradiction to the required representation that the document has been duly authorized.",

                "explanation": "Replacing Adam D. Portnoy's signature with \"Forged Signature\" indicates that the document was not properly signed by him. Securities law dictates the signature must be authentic and authorized. A forged signature invalidates the filing.",

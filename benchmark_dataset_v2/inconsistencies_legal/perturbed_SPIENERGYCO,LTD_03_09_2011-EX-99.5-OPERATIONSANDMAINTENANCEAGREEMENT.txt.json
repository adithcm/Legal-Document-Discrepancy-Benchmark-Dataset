Changing the response time to 30 days creates a contradiction with state law.",

California Labor Code Section 202 dictates that if an employee quits, his or her wages are due and payable no later than 72 hours. While it is not a wage agreement, this agreement has similarities to a contractor-employee relationship, therefore delaying the delivery of documentation to 15 days would violate this Labor Code Section.",

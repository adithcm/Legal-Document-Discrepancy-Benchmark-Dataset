                "original_text": "This Agreement will automatically be renewed for periods of twelve (12) months unless either Party gives six (6) months written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement. Such renewals shall continue for successive periods under the same terms and conditions, unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement will automatically be renewed for periods of twelve (12) months unless either Party gives one (1) months written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement. Such renewals shall continue for successive periods under the same terms and conditions, unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notice period for termination from six months to one month could be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable, especially considering the scale and complexity of the outsourcing agreement. Courts often look to industry standards and the relative bargaining power of the parties when determining the reasonableness of notice periods. This change introduces a potential legal challenge regarding adequate notice.",

                "explanation": "Extending the payment timeframe for credits and debits to 90 days, from one month, can cause financial strain. Delayed payments may lead to cash flow issues for the receiving party, creating an unreasonable burden. Depending on the jurisdiction and industry, payment terms exceeding standard practices may be challenged as unfair or violating prompt payment laws, particularly if one party has significantly more bargaining power.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the statute of limitations for breach of contract from an unspecified period to one year contradicts standard legal practice. Most jurisdictions have longer statutes of limitations for contract claims (e.g., four to six years). This shortened period could unfairly limit the ability of a party to pursue legitimate claims, especially in complex transactions where damages may not be immediately apparent.",

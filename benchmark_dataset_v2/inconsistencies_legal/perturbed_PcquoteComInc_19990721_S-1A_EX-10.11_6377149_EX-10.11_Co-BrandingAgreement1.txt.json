                "original_text": "B.  The charges for the services set forth in this Agreement shall be invoiced monthly.  ABW agrees to pay said charges within thirty (30) days of the monthly invoice date.  ABW may issue a purchase order for billing purposes.  The invoices must reference that purchase order number and be sent to the \"Bill To\" address stated on the purchase order.  The terms of this negotiated Agreement shall supercede those contained on that purchase order.",
                "changed_text": "B.  The charges for the services set forth in this Agreement shall be invoiced monthly.  ABW agrees to pay said charges within fifteen (15) days of the monthly invoice date.  ABW may issue a purchase order for billing purposes.  The invoices must reference that purchase order number and be sent to the \"Bill To\" address stated on the purchase order.  The terms of this negotiated Agreement shall supercede those contained on that purchase order.",
                "explanation": "The payment term has been reduced from 30 days to 15 days. This can create a conflict with standard business practices and potentially violate certain state laws that require reasonable payment terms, especially for small businesses. Many states require a minimum payment window to facilitate proper auditing and reconciliation.",

                "changed_text": "D.  Any payments which have not been received by PCQ within ten (10) days of the Invoice date shall be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE of 5.0% per month which is a corresponding ANNUAL\n\nPERCENTAGE RATE of 60% on the outstanding balance.",
                "explanation": "The payment grace period has been reduced from 30 days to 10 days, and the finance charge significantly increased. This combination could be considered predatory and might violate usury laws in some states, as well as potentially conflicting with consumer protection regulations that mandate reasonable terms and adequate grace periods before penalties are applied.",

                "explanation": "The timeframe for disputing invoices has been reduced from 30 days to 5 days. This severely restricts ABW's ability to properly audit and reconcile invoices, potentially violating generally accepted accounting principles and potentially conflicting with requirements for fair business practices, especially given Illinois state law may mandate more reasonable dispute windows for financial transactions. This could also be viewed as an unconscionable term.",

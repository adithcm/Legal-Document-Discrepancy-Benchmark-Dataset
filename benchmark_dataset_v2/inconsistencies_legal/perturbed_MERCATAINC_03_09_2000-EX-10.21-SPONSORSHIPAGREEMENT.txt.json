FNW will send Sponsor invoices Sponsorship Fee in         --------------------         two (2) monthly installments beginning September 1, 1999. Invoices are         payable thirty (30) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee         will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a         rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum will be charged on all balances         not paid within thirty (30) days of the date they are due.",
                "changed_text": "3.1. Invoices and Payment.  FNW will send Sponsor invoices Sponsorship Fee in two (2) monthly installments beginning September 1, 1999. Invoices are payable ten (10) days after receipt. A five percent (5%) late fee will be added to all invoices which become past due and interest at a rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per annum will be charged on all balances not paid within ten (10) days of the date they are due.",
                "explanation": "The original contract specifies invoices are payable within 30 days, which is a reasonable and standard practice. The modification changes the payment term to 10 days and increases the interest rate to 25%. This introduces a legal contradiction because many states have laws regulating the maximum interest rate that can be charged on late payments or outstanding balances. Furthermore, a 10 day payment window may be considered unconscionable under Washington State Law.",

                "explanation": "The original termination clause requires a 45-day written notice. The modified clause reduces this to 5 days. This may be considered an unreasonably short notice period, especially given the nature of the sponsorship agreement and the investments made by both parties. This short notice period could contradict principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause stipulates that each party is responsible for breaches by its officers, employees, agents, and representatives and lasts three years after the contract expires. The modified clause limits responsibility for breaches to only officers and removes any survival period after termination. This undermines the protection of confidential information, potentially conflicting with trade secret laws that require reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality. Removing the survival clause and limiting responsibility for breaches only by officers could remove necessary safeguards under Washington state's Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which can include liabilities for actions by other representatives.",

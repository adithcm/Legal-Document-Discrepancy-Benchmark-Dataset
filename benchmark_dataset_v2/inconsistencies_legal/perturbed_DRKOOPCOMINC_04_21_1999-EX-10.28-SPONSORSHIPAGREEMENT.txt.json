                "original_text": "All notices, statements and reports required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to have been effectively given and received: (i) five (5) business days after the date of mailing if sent by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile, provided a confirmation of transmission is produced by the sending machine and a copy of such facsimile is promptly sent by another means specified in this section; or (iii) when delivered if delivered personally or sent by express courier service.",
                "changed_text": "All notices, statements and reports required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to have been effectively given and received: (i) twenty (20) business days after the date of mailing if sent by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested; (ii) only when printed and mailed if sent by facsimile, provided a confirmation of transmission is produced by the sending machine and a copy of such facsimile is promptly sent by another means specified in this section; or (iii) when delivered if delivered personally and given by express courier service.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides reasonable notice periods. The modification extends the mailing notice period to 20 business days, which could be considered unreasonably long and prejudicial, potentially conflicting with legal standards for timely notice in contract law. The edit also removes the electronic element from the section regarding facsimiles by requiring that notices are only considered 'given and received' when printed and mailed.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period from 30 days to 10 days for a breach of contract could be deemed unreasonable, particularly for complex breaches, and may conflict with legal standards requiring reasonable opportunity to cure. This is especially true in a sponsorship agreement where the breach may involve marketing campaigns or technical integrations that require more than 10 days to rectify.",

The parties agree that the arbitrators shall only have the power to award damages, but will have no legal rights to award injunctive relief or reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses to any party in such arbitration.",
                "explanation": "Limiting the arbitrator's power to award only damages and excluding injunctive relief and attorneys' fees may conflict with arbitration laws in many jurisdictions, including the United States, which typically allow arbitrators to grant a full range of remedies, including injunctive relief and attorneys' fees, unless explicitly restricted by the agreement and if the law permits it.",

                "original_text": "E. PAYMENT. Except as may be specifically authorized in writing by NETGEAR, and subject to NETGEAR's continuing approval of Distributor's credit status and financial condition, Distributor will pay NETGEAR for all Products ordered by Distributor within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that payment for the initial order placed by Distributor under this Agreement shall be due and payable within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. NETGEAR, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to specify, and to change from time to time, Distributor's credit line and payment terms. All payments are to be made in U.S. dollars. Payment for shipments made outside of the United States shall be made by wire transfer in accordance with wire",
                "changed_text": "E. PAYMENT. Except as may be specifically authorized in writing by NETGEAR, and subject to NETGEAR's continuing approval of Distributor's credit status and financial condition, Distributor will pay NETGEAR for all Products ordered by Distributor within 90 days of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that payment for the initial order placed by Distributor under this Agreement shall be due and payable within 120 days of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. NETGEAR, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to specify, and to change from time to time, Distributor's credit line and payment terms. All payments are to be made in U.S. dollars.

                "explanation": "The original contract specifies payment terms within a certain timeframe, indicated by '[*]' which is intended to be filled with a specific number of days. Modifying this to 90 days for standard payments and 120 days for initial orders introduces a legal contradiction because such extended payment terms could violate California's prompt payment laws (since the contract is governed by California law, as stated in section 19). These laws generally mandate shorter payment periods, especially for certain types of businesses, and unreasonably delaying payments could lead to legal repercussions.",

For changes which, in NETGEAR's opinion, may adversely affect Distributor, NETGEAR will provide thirty (30) days notice, or such longer period as NETGEAR deems appropriate, prior to the effective date of such change.",

NETGEAR will provide seven (7) days notice prior to the effective date of such change, regardless of whether the changes may adversely affect Distributor.",
                "explanation": "California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in all contracts. Reducing the notice period to seven days, especially for changes that adversely affect the distributor, could be deemed commercially unreasonable and a violation of this implied covenant. The original text provides 30 days' notice for adverse changes, which is a more reasonable timeframe; this change introduces a shorter, potentially unfair notice period.",

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) the other party becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, or ceases doing business; or (ii) the other party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the party not in default. Upon termination of the Agreement by NETGEAR for Distributor's breach, NETGEAR may cancel all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders without further obligation.

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) the other party becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, or ceases doing business; or (ii) the other party fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from the party not in default. Upon termination of the Agreement by NETGEAR for Distributor's breach, NETGEAR may cancel all of Distributor's unfulfilled orders without further obligation. This Agreement may be terminated at any time without cause by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach from thirty days to ten days may be considered unreasonably short, especially considering the complexities of business operations and the potential for disputes. Under California law, contracts must be interpreted in a way that is commercially reasonable. A ten-day cure period may not provide sufficient time for a party to rectify a significant breach, particularly in a complex distributor agreement, potentially conflicting with principles of fairness and reasonableness implied in contract law.",

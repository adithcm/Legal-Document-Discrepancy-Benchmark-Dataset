                "changed_text": "8.3 Each party agrees that for a period of one (1) year following the disclosure of Confidential Information, it (a) will not use, directly or indirectly, or reproduce the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, (b) will not disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any third parties except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, and (c) will take all reasonable security measures to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession or control, which will in no event be less than the measures it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own information of similar importance.",
                "explanation": "Many states, including California where the reseller is located, recognize trade secrets, which under state law, can have indefinite protection as long as they remain secret and provide a competitive advantage. Reducing the confidentiality period to one year could be deemed insufficient to protect trade secrets, conflicting with California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA).",

                "explanation": "Changing the confirmation of the facsimile from five to ten days may not be sufficient depending on the state's statutes of frauds that involve real estate. Although the contract does not state real estate as part of its conditions, it is not clearly stated that real estate is excluded from this. Therefore, the change of the confirmation of the facsimile goes against common law practice.",

In addition to any other rights or remedies that may be available at law or in equity, either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and has not cured the breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice specifying the breach. If the breach is not cured within the thirty (30) day period, termination will become effective on the thirty-first (31st) day following the written notice.",

If the breach is not cured within the ten (10) day period, termination will become effective on the eleventh (11th) day following the written notice.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the cure period for a material breach to ten days could be considered unconscionable or a violation of good faith and fair dealing, especially in situations where the breach involves complex issues that reasonably require more time to resolve. Many jurisdictions imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, and a court might find that ten days is insufficient time, thus making the termination clause unenforceable under general contract law principles.",

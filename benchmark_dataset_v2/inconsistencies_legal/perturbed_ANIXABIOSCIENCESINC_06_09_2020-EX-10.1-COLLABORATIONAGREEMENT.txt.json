                "original_text": "(a) pay OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 16,667 Euros within five (5) days after the Effective Date; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each one-month anniversary of the Effective Date, except that the last such payment will be due within thirty (30) days after completion of all activities under the Research Plan; and",
                "changed_text": "(a) pay OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 16,667 Euros within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each one-month anniversary of the Effective Date, except that the last such payment will be due within ninety (90) days after completion of all activities under the Research Plan; and",
                "explanation": "The original text requires payment within five days of the effective date. Delayed payment until sixty days after the effective date contradicts standard business practices, potentially violating implied duties of good faith and fair dealing, making it harder for OntoChem to get the payments. Additionally, delaying the final payment until ninety days after completion introduces uncertainty and extends payment terms beyond what is commercially reasonable, potentially conflicting with prompt payment laws if they apply.",

                "original_text": "Payments to OntoChem will be made by check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as designated in writing by OntoChem from time to time. Taxes (and any penalties and interest thereon) imposed on any payment made by Anixa to OntoChem will be the responsibility of OntoChem. The fees for the respective bank transfers will be borne by Anixa.",
                "changed_text": "Payments to OntoChem will be made at Anixa's discretion. Taxes (and any penalties and interest thereon) imposed on any payment made by Anixa to OntoChem will be the shared responsibility of Anixa and OntoChem. The fees for the respective bank transfers will be borne by OntoChem.",
                "explanation": "Modifying the payment terms to be at Anixa's discretion creates uncertainty and potential non-compliance with contract law principles requiring clear and defined payment obligations. Also, shifting the responsibility of taxes and bank transfer fees to OntoChem could violate tax laws or regulations, depending on the specific jurisdiction and the nature of the payments. These changes introduce ambiguity and potential legal challenges.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be terminated by Anixa, without cause, upon at least five (5) days written notice to OntoChem.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the termination notice period to five days may be deemed unreasonable, especially considering the international nature of the agreement and the potential impact on OntoChem. This could be viewed as a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law, as it doesn't provide OntoChem with adequate time to wind down operations or secure alternative arrangements. Moreover, it may contradict international business norms for contract termination, increasing the risk of legal disputes.",

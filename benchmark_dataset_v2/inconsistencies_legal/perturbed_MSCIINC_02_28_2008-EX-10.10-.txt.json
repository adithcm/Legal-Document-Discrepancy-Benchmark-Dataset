                "original_text": "Any notice, instruction, direction or demand under the terms of this Agreement required to be in writing shall be duly given upon delivery, if delivered by hand, facsimile transmission, or mail, to the following addresses:\n\nTo Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated:\n\nMorgan Stanley 1585 Broadway New York, NY 10036 Attn: Martin M. Cohen, Director of Company Law Facsimile: (212) 507-3334\n\nTo MSCI:\n\nMSCl Inc. 88 Pine Street New York, New York 10005 Attn: General Counsel Facsimile: (212) 804-2906\n\nor to such other addresses or telecopy numbers as may be specified by like notice to the other party. All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed given, (a) when delivered in person or by courier or a courier services, (b) if sent by facsimile transmission (receipt confirmed) on a business day prior to 5 p.m. in the place of receipt, on the date of transmission (or, if sent after 5 p.m., on the following business day) or (c) if mailed by certified mail (return receipt requested), on the date specified on the return receipt.",

                "explanation": "The modification to section 6.3 alters the conditions under which notices are considered 'duly given.' Specifically, changing the facsimile transmission term to only on the 10th business day contradicts standard business practices and legal expectations for prompt communication. Also, the change to standard mail removes the confirmation required for legal proceedings.",

                "original_text": "MS hereby grants (subject to any existing third party contractual obligations) to MSCI a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, world- wide, royalty-free license for MSCI to use, modify, copy, create derivative works of and sublicense, for any business purpose, the MS Licensed Materials.",
                "changed_text": "MS hereby grants (subject to any existing third party contractual obligations) to MSCI a non-exclusive, terminable at will, revocable, limited to the state of Delaware, royalty-based license for MSCI to use, but not to modify, copy, create derivative works of or sublicense, for any internal business purpose, the MS Licensed Materials. This license will automatically terminate 30 days after the Trigger Date.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free' to 'terminable at will, revocable, limited to the state of Delaware, royalty-based', the terms now heavily restrict MSCI's usage rights and introduce conditions for termination that could be deemed unreasonable, especially the 30-day termination after the Trigger Date. The limited use now places restrictions where it was previously open-ended, making the agreement less favorable and potentially conflicting with established intellectual property norms and introducing legal uncertainty.",

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.",

MSCI Inc. is registered to do business in New York under the name NY MSCI.\n\n(b) Any action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the courts of San Diego County, California, and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding. Any objection to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum is now encouraged to the fullest extent permitted by law. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served only within the state of California.",
                "explanation": "Changing the governing law to California law introduces potential conflicts, as New York law is more commonly applied to contracts of this nature. By forcing exclusive jurisdiction in San Diego County, CA, despite the companies being based in NY, adds legal uncertainty about the enforceability of the jurisdiction clause. Furthermore, limiting service of process to California only is an unreasonable restriction on the ability to enforce the contract internationally.",

                "explanation": "The original text allows five days for reporting unauthorized disclosures of confidential information. Reducing this timeframe to one day is inconsistent with HIPAA's breach notification rule, which allows a reasonable timeframe for investigation and assessment before mandatory reporting. This timeframe is often longer than 24 hours.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires records to be made available within ten days of a written request. Modifying the deadline to thirty days could violate laws that mandate quicker responses to records requests, such as those related to patient health information under HIPAA or state privacy laws depending on the information involved and the nature of the request.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates the return or destruction of confidential information within 15 days of termination. Lengthening this period to 60 days could be problematic under regulations that demand prompt data disposal upon contract termination, particularly if the information includes personal data governed by privacy laws like GDPR or CCPA, or PHI governed by HIPAA, depending on the data involved and the sensitivity.",

The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's first 2 fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter.",

Insurance regulations in Texas and generally require that companies maintain minimum capital levels and address any deficiencies promptly. This change could lead to non-compliance if AIG cannot make the required contributions in such a short time.",

AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); provided, however, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the 3 corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer, in each case, (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale.",

AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); provided, however, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement under any circumstances. To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect.",
                "explanation": "This change shortens the notice period for termination to 5 days and simultaneously prohibits AIG from terminating the agreement except after the sale of the company. This potentially contradicts regulatory expectations for capital maintenance agreements, which usually require reasonable termination clauses that allow for adjustments in corporate structure. A five-day notice period is insufficient for the Company to arrange alternative capital support, violating the implicit good faith and fair dealing requirements. By prohibiting termination under any circumstances it might not be valid.",

                "explanation": "This change eliminates policyholder rights to enforce the capital maintenance agreement, contradicting the intent of such agreements to protect policyholders. State insurance regulations often mandate that capital maintenance agreements provide some mechanism for policyholder protection, as they are the ultimate beneficiaries of a financially stable insurer. Eliminating policyholder enforcement rights could be deemed an unfair or deceptive practice and may be against public policy, specifically harming those that relied on the solvency of the insurance company.",

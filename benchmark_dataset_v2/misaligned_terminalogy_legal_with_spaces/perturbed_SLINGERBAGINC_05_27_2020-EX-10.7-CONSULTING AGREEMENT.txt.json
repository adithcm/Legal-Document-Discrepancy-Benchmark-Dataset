                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Consultant agrees to faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the Company and to devote the time, attention efforts to further the business interests of the Company and utilize his professional skills and care during the Term.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant agrees to occasionally provide services to the Company and to dedicate only reasonable efforts to promote the interests of the Company and employ his skills and minimal care during the Term.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates faithful, honest, and diligent service, creating an enforceable standard. The modified text replaces these strict obligations with less stringent terms like 'occasionally provide services,' 'reasonable efforts,' and 'minimal care.' This change introduces ambiguity and contradicts the expected level of commitment typically required in a consulting agreement, making enforcement uncertain. Specifically, the term 'diligently' has a legal meaning, while 'minimal care' is much more vague.",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The Consultant's monthly base consulting fee shall be three thousand two hundred fifty United States dollars ($3,250 (together with any increases thereto as hereinafter provided, the \"Base Consulting Fee\") through 19 August 2020. Commencing on 20 August 2020, Consultant's Base Consulting Fee shall be increased to $8,500 per calendar month. The Base Consulting Fee shall be payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll procedures in effect from time to time. All subsequent monthly payments of Base Consulting Fee shall be paid within the first five days of the following calendar month.",
                "changed_text": "The Consultant's monthly compensation will be determined by the Company on a monthly basis with no set minimum. The 'Base Consulting Fee', if any, shall be payable at the company's discretion according to its revenue cycle.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines a fixed 'Base Consulting Fee' with clear payment terms. The modified clause replaces this with discretionary compensation determined monthly by the Company. This introduces significant uncertainty and contradicts the concept of a 'base fee,' which implies a guaranteed minimum payment. This undermines the consultant's ability to rely on a predictable income stream, leading to potential disputes and making the agreement unenforceable under standard contract principles regarding consideration and definiteness of terms.",

                "location": "2.1 (a)"

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For the purpose of this Article 3, \"Cause\" means: (i) Breach of Agreement. Consultant's material breach of Consultant's obligations of this Agreement, not cured after 30 days' Notice from the Company.",
                "changed_text": "For the purpose of this Article 3, \"Cause\" may mean: (i) Perceived Issues. Any issues the Company perceives with the Consultant's performance.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines 'Cause' for termination based on 'material breach' that is not cured after notice, establishing an objective standard. The modified clause replaces this with 'any issues the Company perceives,' making termination entirely subjective. This directly contradicts the legal standard for 'Cause' in contract law, which requires a demonstrable and significant violation of the agreement. This change renders the termination clause arbitrary and unenforceable, potentially violating principles of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Contract law principles defining 'Cause' for termination and the requirement of good faith.",

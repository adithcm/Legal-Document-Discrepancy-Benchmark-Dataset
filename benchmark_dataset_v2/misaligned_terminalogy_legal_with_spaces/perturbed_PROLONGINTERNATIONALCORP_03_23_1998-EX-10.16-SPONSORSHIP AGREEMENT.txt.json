                "original_text": "WHEREAS, Sabco is engaged in the business of operating NASCAR Winston Cup  Series race cars and wishes to provide advertising space and advertising,  promotional and marketing assistance to Prolong; and\n\n     WHEREAS, Prolong desires to become a major associate sponsor of all three Sabco entries during the 1998, 1999 and year-2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing seasons. These entries shall mean the Sabco No. 40, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; the Sabco No. 42, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; and Sabco No. 46, all NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period. Prolong shall use its sponsorship of the Sabco entries for advertising, promoting and marketing itself.",

These entries shall mean the Sabco No. 40, some NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; the Sabco No. 42, various NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period; and Sabco No. 46, select NASCAR Winston Cup Series races during this three-year period. Prolong shall use its sponsorship of the Sabco entries for advertising, promoting and marketing itself.",
                "explanation": "The term 'major associate sponsor' is a common term and has a defined expectation within sponsorship agreements and marketing law, implying substantial involvement and visibility. Changing this to 'contributing sponsor' and altering 'all' races to 'some', 'various', and 'select' introduces ambiguity about the level of commitment and rights granted to Prolong. This creates uncertainty about what Prolong is actually entitled to under the agreement, contradicting the initial intention of a clearly defined sponsorship.",

                "original_text": "Sabco will designate Prolong as an associate sponsor on its No. 40, No. 42 and No. 46 Winston Cup race cars in the aforementioned 33 events. Sabco shall cause each car to be painted with paint schemes approved by each's primary sponsor and shall cause to display Prolong associate sponsor decal signage upon the middle side panel (between car number and rear tire; both sides of car) with dimensions of approximately 6\n\n  inches high by 16 inches long. In addition, Sabco shall provide, subject to Prolong's approval, drive, pit crew, team uniforms, team pit equipment, team race car transporter, show car and show car transporter bearing prominent Prolong associate sponsor identification as well as team pit equipment with size and placement commensurate with level of sponsorship",
                "changed_text": "Sabco will designate Prolong as a sponsor on its No. 40, No. 42 and No. 46 Winston Cup race cars in some of the events. Sabco shall cause each car to be painted with paint schemes approved by each's primary sponsor and may display Prolong sponsor decal signage upon the side of car with dimensions to be determined. In addition, Sabco may provide drive, pit crew, team uniforms, team pit equipment, team race car transporter, show car and show car transporter bearing Prolong sponsor identification.",
                "explanation": "Removing the 'associate' modifier makes the sponsorship level ambiguous. Also, changing 'shall cause to display' to 'may display' and 'shall provide' to 'may provide' introduces discretion for Sabco where there was previously a binding obligation. This contradicts the expectation of a clearly defined sponsorship agreement where deliverables are specified, making enforcement uncertain under contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, Sabco may represent other companies in similar categories to Prolong's products.",
                "explanation": "By changing the language from a prohibition on representing competing companies to a permission to do so, this completely reverses the exclusivity provision. This creates a direct contradiction in terms, rendering the clause unenforceable and fundamentally altering the nature of the sponsorship agreement. The clause has no caveat to any representation, making the term wholly encompassing and non-beneficial to Prolong.",

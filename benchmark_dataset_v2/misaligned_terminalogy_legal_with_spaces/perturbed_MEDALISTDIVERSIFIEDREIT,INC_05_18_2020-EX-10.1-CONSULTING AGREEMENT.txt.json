                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the contract aims for an independent contractor relationship, 'worker' is a broader term with potential employee implications, conflicting with the intended independent contractor status under Virginia labor laws.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'independent contractor' with 'worker' here introduces uncertainty. The phrase 'not necessarily as an employee' further weakens the intended clarity, potentially conflicting with federal guidelines distinguishing between independent contractors and employees.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Because this Agreement creates an independent contractor relationship, the parties understand that the Company has no obligation to withhold any state or federal income taxes, social security, or other taxes from payments to CONSULTANT, nor shall it make any workers' compensation or unemployment benefit payments, contributions or payroll tax payments on behalf of CONSULTANT.",
                "changed_text": "Because this Agreement creates a worker relationship, the parties understand that the Company may not be obligated to withhold any state or federal income taxes, social security, or other taxes from payments to CONSULTANT, nor shall it make any workers' compensation or unemployment benefit payments, contributions or payroll tax payments on behalf of CONSULTANT.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' and introducing 'may not be obligated' creates a direct contradiction. By stating there 'may not' be an obligation, it sows doubt as to the specific withholding requirements that could legally be necessary. In addition, the term 'worker relationship' has no specific meaning under law.",

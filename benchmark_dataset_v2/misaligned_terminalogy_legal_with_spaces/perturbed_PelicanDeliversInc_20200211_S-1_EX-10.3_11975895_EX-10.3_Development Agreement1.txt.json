                "explanation": "In Washington state, where Bellevue is located, the legal age to purchase cannabis is 21. Changing the age to 18 contradicts state law, potentially leading to legal issues related to underage access and sales.",

                "explanation": "The original text suggests a structured timer. The new text contradicts it making it entirely at the discretion of the driver to accept or reject, with the driver not being penalized for not accepting an order. This contradicts any reasonable expectation of due diligence and efficient service, creating conflict with potential contractual obligations",

                "explanation": "By adding 'arbitrarily modify the percentage or fee based on dispensary, based on undisclosed metrics' to the original text, the fee structure for the dispensary becomes uncertain. This contradicts the intent for financial transparency. The use of 'undisclosed metrics' is legally challenging.",

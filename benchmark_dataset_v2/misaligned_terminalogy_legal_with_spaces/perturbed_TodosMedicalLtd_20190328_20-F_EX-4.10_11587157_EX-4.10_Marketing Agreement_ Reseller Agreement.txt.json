                "original_text": "1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Todos hereby grants the Reseller a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, exclusive right to distribute and sell the Products to Customers in the Territory; provided, however, that Reseller may sub-license or transfer its distribution rights to a subsidiary or affiliate of the Reseller.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Todos hereby grants the Reseller a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, exclusive right to distribute and sell the Products to Customers in the Territory; provided, however, that Reseller may allow another company that it does business with to do so too.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows sub-licensing or transfer to subsidiaries/affiliates, which maintains legal clarity under corporate law. The modification replaces this with 'another company that it does business with', which is vague and undefined. This conflicts with standard contract law principles requiring clear definition of rights and obligations. It creates uncertainty about who can exercise distribution rights and under what conditions, making the exclusivity clause difficult to enforce. It goes against standard business law",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates compliance with quality assurance and Israeli standards. The modified clause changes 'shall comply' to 'shall try its best to comply' and 'shall ensure' to 'shall try to ensure', introducing a subjective element. This contradicts the objective standards required by Israeli regulatory law for medical products. It creates a loophole that would make it difficult to hold Todos accountable for meeting those standards, as 'trying its best' is open to interpretation and does not guarantee conformity with regulations.",

All payments made to Todos shall be in New Israeli Shekels.",

Todos may invoice the Reseller for all sums due for Products ordered upon shipment of the ordered Products to the Reseller, and the Reseller may pay such sums at a reasonable time, no later than never. All payments made to Todos shall be preferably be in New Israeli Shekels, but other currencies can be accepted as well.",
                "explanation": "The original clause sets a firm payment schedule and currency. The modified clause introduces uncertainty by changing 'shall invoice' to 'may invoice', 'shall pay' to 'may pay such sums at a reasonable time, no later than never' and also makes the currency flexible. This contradicts basic principles of contract law requiring clarity on payment obligations. The added uncertainty makes it difficult to enforce payment terms, as the timing and even the obligation to pay are now discretionary. The original clause is a requirement of business law.",

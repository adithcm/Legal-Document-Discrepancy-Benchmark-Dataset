                "explanation": "The modified definition adds words of discretion and vague language to key components of maintenance services, making the service level uncertain and unenforceable, this contradicts the initial obligation.",

For Class 1 Errors, Supplier shall provide a Correction or workaround reasonable in Bank of America's judgment within the Repair Period after Bank of America reports the Error, or within four (4) hours after Bank of America first reports the Error if no other Repair Period is specified. These steps shall include assigning fully-qualified technicians to work with Bank of America without interruption or additional charge, twenty-four (24) hours per day, until Supplier provides a Correction or workaround reasonable in Bank of America's judgment.",
                "changed_text": "B. For Class 1 Errors, Supplier may attempt to provide a Correction or workaround potentially reasonable in Bank of America's judgment, subject to resource availability. The timeframe for providing such remedy or workaround is not guaranteed and may vary based on unforeseen circumstances. Supplier will endeavor to assign technicians of uncertain qualification, subject to availability, to possibly collaborate with Bank of America. Such collaboration may or may not be continuous, may incur additional charges, and will not be guaranteed 24/7. The aim is for Supplier to provide a Correction or workaround of uncertain utility to Bank of America.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces uncertainty regarding response times, technician qualifications, continuity of support, and additional charges, contradicting the clear obligation for immediate and continuous support for Class 1 errors. It replaces firm obligations with vague possibilities, undermining the enforceability of the clause.",

Supplier's obligation to address such vulnerabilities will be assessed based on perceived risk, with remedies applied as deemed appropriate within a timeframe that Supplier considers commercially viable. The obligation to apply these measures applies only to specific devices, solely determined by the supplier.",

                "changed_text": "Section 1.77 \"Professional\" means a physician, regardless of their legal ability to prescribe Product.",
                "explanation": "This change broadens the definition of \"Professional\" to include physicians who may not have the legal authority to prescribe the Product. This contradicts standard medical and pharmaceutical regulations that require a professional to be legally authorized to prescribe medications, leading to potential legal complications regarding who can be marketed to and influenced.",

                "original_text": "Section 1.89 \"Sales Representatives\" means sales representatives employed by King or Depomed, or a Third Party engaged by King or Depomed, to Promote the Product, who have been trained and equipped to Promote the Product in accordance with this Agreement. In the case of King, Third Parties may only be engaged as Sales Representatives if they are full-time contractors of King, exclusive to King, and carry King's business card.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.89 \"Sales Representatives\" means individuals compensated for promoting the product. Third-party engagements are allowed without exclusivity agreements.",
                "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for Sales Representatives to be trained and equipped according to the agreement, and also removes the requirement for King's Third-Party Sales Representatives to be full-time contractors exclusive to King. This contradicts regulations around pharmaceutical marketing, which require proper training and compliance, and opens the door for potential conflicts of interest if Sales Representatives are not exclusive.",

In performing its duties hereunder, each party shall, and shall cause the King Sales Force or Depomed Sales Force, as applicable, and its employees and agents to, comply with all Legal Requirements, including the FDA's regulations and guidelines concerning the advertising of prescription drug products, DDMAC's promotional guidelines, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, the American Medical Association's Guidelines on Gifts to Physicians, the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Providers, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the ACCME Standards for Commercial Support of Continuing Medical Education, equal employment, non-discrimination and federal and state anti-kickback Legal Requirements, Legal Requirements with respect to submission of false claims to governmental or private health care payors, and all industry and professional standards, which may be applicable to the activities (including the warehousing, handling and distribution of Samples) to be performed by such party hereunder.",

                "explanation": "This revision replaces the explicit requirement to comply with all Legal Requirements and specific guidelines with a vague statement that the parties will aim to consider relevant guidelines. This creates a legal contradiction as it removes the binding obligation to follow laws and regulations, making the compliance section unenforceable. This contradicts several specific laws and guidelines.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "\"Business Day\" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, or any other day on which commercial banks in Tokyo, Japan or New York in the U.S.A. are authorized or required by applicable Law to close.",
                "changed_text": "\"Business Day\" shall mean any day other than a weekend, or any day the involved parties deem inappropriate for business.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Business Day\" relies on objective criteria (bank closures due to law). The modified version introduces subjective criteria, allowing parties to arbitrarily decide what constitutes a business day. This creates uncertainty and contradicts standard legal and business practices, potentially affecting deadlines and obligations.",
                "contradicted_law": "General principles of contract law requiring clarity and certainty in terms.",
                "location": "Section 1.01 Definitions"

                "changed_text": "\"Material Adverse Effect\" shall mean any event that the Acquiror subjectively believes undermines the intended alliance.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Material Adverse Effect\" is tied to objective factors (financial condition, assets, etc.). The modified definition introduces a subjective standard ('Acquiror subjectively believes'), giving the Acquiror broad discretion to invoke the clause based on its own interpretation. This contradicts typical legal interpretations requiring an objective, reasonable standard for assessing material adverse effects.",
                "contradicted_law": "General contract law principles requiring good faith and objective standards in contract interpretation.",

During the period from the date of this Agreement and the completion of the Squeeze-out (the \"Restricted Period\"), except as contemplated by this Agreement, required by applicable Law or otherwise agreed to in writing by Acquiror, the Company shall operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with the past practice and use its reasonable efforts to preserve intact the material components of its current business organization, including keeping available the services of current officers and key employees, and use its reasonable efforts to maintain its relations and good will with all material suppliers, material customers, governmental bodies and other material business relations intact its business relationships.",

                "explanation": "The original clause mandates operation in the \"ordinary course of business,\" a term with established legal meaning. The modified version gives the Company unfettered discretion to operate 'as it sees fit,' nullifying the intended constraint and creating a direct contradiction. This could lead to actions inconsistent with the agreement's purpose.",

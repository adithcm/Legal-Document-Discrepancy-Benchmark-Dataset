                "original_text": "\"Agreed Standards\" means all standards, specifications, guidelines and regulations as to quality, safety and performance as are consistently applied by Miltenyi from time to time with respect to the manufacture and quality control of the relevant Miltenyi Product in accordance with Miltenyi's established quality system, standard operating procedures, and quality control procedures, and includes (i) any standard(s) as may be specifically determined to be applicable to the manufacture and quality control of the relevant Miltenyi Product (if any) (for example, with regard to the manufacturing of cell processing reagents or processing aids) by agreement between Miltenyi and any relevant Regulatory Authority/ies and as set forth in Miltenyi's relevant Master Files and/or the Quality Agreement and (ii) any standard(s) as may be expressly agreed between the Parties with respect to a relevant Miltenyi Product from time to time in writing in this Agreement or in an amendment to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"Agreed Standards\" means all informal manufacturing practices, internal protocols and subjective operational guidelines regarding quality, safety and performance that are occasionally used by Miltenyi with respect to the manufacture and quality control of the relevant Miltenyi Product. It explicitly excludes (i) any standard(s) determined to be applicable to the manufacture and quality control of the relevant Miltenyi Product by agreement between Miltenyi and any relevant Regulatory Authority/ies and as set forth in Miltenyi's relevant Master Files and/or the Quality Agreement and (ii) any standard(s) as may be expressly agreed between the Parties with respect to a relevant Miltenyi Product from time to time in writing in this Agreement or in an amendment to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "By changing the definition of 'Agreed Standards' from a set of consistently applied regulations and guidelines to subjective practices and explicitly excluding standards agreed with Regulatory Authorities and the quality agreement, the change creates a legal contradiction. This is because 'Agreed Standards' have an existing industry-standard meaning, particularly within pharmaceutical manufacturing. The contradiction between the contract and the standard definition creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "changed_text": "Miltenyi shall have the Miltenyi Products labelled at their discretion, with any identifying mark of their choosing and packaged for shipping using whatever materials they deem appropriate.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by replacing requirements for compliance with 'Agreed Standards', traceable lot numbers, and commercial packaging with a discretionary approach for labeling and packaging. Industry standards and regulations typically require traceability and specific packaging to ensure product integrity and safety. By making this discretionary, the language contradicts established legal and regulatory expectations for pharmaceutical products.",

                "changed_text": "Bellicum is presumed to understand the qualities and best use-case for each Miltenyi Product purchase, with no independent verification or assessment required.",
                "explanation": "The original text suggests that Bellicum has the competency to make a sound decision. Now, Bellicum doesn't need to make a sound decision as long as there is a presumption to agree with Miltenyi. This introduces a legal contradiction because it removes any actual requirement for a reasonable assessment, creating uncertainty. Federal standards have strict guidance with 'competencies'.",

                "original_text": "e)   \"Excite@Home Member(s)\" shall mean a User who has registered as a           member of the Excite@Home Network, regardless of that User's stated           preference regarding allowing their registration information to be           shared with third parties.",

                "explanation": "The original definition includes all registered users, regardless of their privacy preferences. The modified definition adds a condition requiring consent for data sharing, which directly contradicts the 'regardless' clause and introduces ambiguity about who qualifies as a member.",

The list of Excite@Home Approved Competitors is defined in EXHIBIT E.",
                "explanation": "This flips the restriction on solicitation, suggesting it's allowed unless explicitly prohibited. This contradicts the original intent and creates confusion about competitive restrictions.

The modified version introduces a vague concept tied to the 'financial standing' of the responsible party. The original, definitive clause for damage liability is conflicted by the financial standing of either party, making a huge difference in either party's responsibility.",

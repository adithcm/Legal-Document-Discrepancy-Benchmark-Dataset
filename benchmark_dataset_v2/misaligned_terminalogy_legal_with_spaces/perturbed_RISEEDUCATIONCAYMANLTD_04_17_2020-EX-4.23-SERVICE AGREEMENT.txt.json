                "original_text": "Service Provider shall provide the following operation support services (the \"Services\") to Service Recipient: (1) Academic Support Services\n\nService Provider, having a dedicated team for research and development in courses and teaching methods, will provide Service Recipient with customized academic supports, including those in respect of teaching skills, operation guidance for teachers, codes of conduct and staff training, to meet the needs of Service Recipient for academic support in its operations.",
                "changed_text": "Service Provider shall provide the following operation support services (the \"Services\") to Service Recipient: (1) Academic Support Services\n\nService Provider, having a team for curriculum development, will provide Service Recipient with generic academic supports, including basic instructional materials and general teacher guidelines. The services provided are intended to be general and adaptable without specific customization.",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"dedicated team for research and development in courses and teaching methods\" with \"a team for curriculum development,\" and \"customized academic supports\" with \"generic academic supports,\" the contract introduces ambiguity. The original implies tailored support. The modification suggests standardized support, conflicting with the original intent and introducing uncertainty about the level of service required under the agreement. This can be an issue under contract law where specific performance is expected.",

                "original_text": "Service Recipient shall pay Service Provider the [service fees]/ [commissions and service fees] ([collectively,] \"Service Fee\") (inclusive of all applicable taxes) in accordance with Schedule 1 for the Services provided by Service Provider.\n\n[To facilitate the operation of Service Recipient, in the event that Service Recipient incurs losses, Service Provider may agree to waive the obligations of Service Recipient to pay Service Fee to Service Provider.]",
                "changed_text": "Service Recipient shall pay Service Provider a specified amount ([collectively,] \"Payment\") in accordance with Schedule 1 for general services provided by Service Provider.\n\n[To facilitate the operation of Service Recipient, in the event that Service Recipient finds it difficult to pay the specified amount, Service Provider may consider a temporary reduction in the Payment to Service Provider.]",
                "explanation": "By replacing \"Service Fee\" with \"Payment\" and removing the specific link to 'commissions,' the contract introduces ambiguity regarding what the payment covers. The original text clearly states the basis for the service fee. The modification only mentions a 'specified amount' for 'general services,' without indicating how this amount is determined or what specific services it pertains to, leading to unenforceability. The replacement of 'incurs losses' with 'finds it difficult to pay' changes the underlying economic grounds for a waiver.",

Neither Party may disclose any confidential information of the other Party without prior written consent from the other Party, except that: (1) relevant information has been made public not as a result of any fault or disclosure by the information recipient; (2) such disclosure is required under applicable laws or regulations or rules of securities exchanges.",

Neither Party may disclose any private information of the other Party without reasonable justification from the other Party, except that: (1) information becomes generally known; (2) such disclosure is deemed necessary.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'confidential information' with 'private information' and significantly altering the exceptions introduces ambiguity. 'Confidential information' has legal precedents. The substituted exceptions 'information becomes generally known' and 'such disclosure is deemed necessary' are broader and less precise than the original clause, diminishing the protection of truly sensitive information. Also, 'reasonable justification' and 'deemed necessary' are vague compared to the original \"prior written consent from the other Party\", creating more space for loopholes.",

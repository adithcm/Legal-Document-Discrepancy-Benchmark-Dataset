                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "(d) Recipient acknowledges that this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship, partnership, joint venture or relationships of trust or agency between the Parties and that all Services are provided by Provider as an independent contractor.",
                "changed_text": "(d) Recipient acknowledges that this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship, partnership, joint venture or relationships of trust or agency between the Parties and that all Services are provided by Provider as a worker.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'independent contractor' to 'worker' creates ambiguity. While the original term has specific legal implications related to liability and employment laws, 'worker' is less defined and could be interpreted broadly, potentially misclassifying the Provider.",
                "contradicted_law": "Varies by jurisdiction but relates to laws governing independent contractor vs. employee classification (e.g., IRS guidelines in the US, similar laws in Singapore and Israel).",

                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Parties hereto shall, and shall instruct their respective representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose the other Party's financial, technical, sales, marketing, development, personnel, and other information, records, or data, including, without limitation, customer lists, supplier lists, designs, product formulations, product specifications or any other proprietary or confidential information, however recorded or preserved, whether written or oral (any such information, \"Confidential Information\").",
                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'trade secrets' in the definition of Confidential Information, the contract potentially weakens the protection of genuine trade secrets, as the term is specifically defined and legally protected under trade secret laws. This deletion means that those items will not be held to the same legal standard of care as other confidential information and opens up a door for future legal issues.",
                "contradicted_law": "Trade Secrets Act (US), or similar laws in Israel or Singapore",

            {
                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \"Losses\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Party\") against any and all unfortunate events and circumstances, relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient.",
                "explanation": "By replacing 'losses, damages, liabilities...' with 'unfortunate events and circumstances' and removing Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement, introduces ambiguity and potentially reduces the scope of indemnification. The original wording has a defined legal context, whereas 'unfortunate events' is vague and might not cover all liabilities intended under standard indemnification clauses. This change makes enforcement uncertain.",

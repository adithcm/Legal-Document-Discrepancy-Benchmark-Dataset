                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Remarketing Securities\" means the Preferred Securities or the Debentures, as applicable, subject to the  Remarketing as notified by the Property Trustee, the Unit Agent and the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, on the third Business Day prior to the  Remarketing Settlement Date; the term \"Remarketing Procedures\" means the procedures in connection with the Remarketing of the Remarketing  Securities described in the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and this Agreement; and the term \"Previous Related Transactions\" means any  transactions in connection with (i) the redemption of or exchange for or exercise of the Warrants or (ii) elections related to participation in the  Remarketing.",
                "changed_text": "As used in this Agreement, the term \"Remarketing Securities\" means whatever securities the Remarketing Agent decides to remarket; the term \"Remarketing Procedures\" means any procedures the Remarketing Agent deems necessary for remarketing the Remarketing Securities; and the term \"Previous Related Transactions\" means any transactions in connection with prior actions.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'Remarketing Securities,' 'Remarketing Procedures,' and 'Previous Related Transactions' are broadly redefined, giving the Remarketing Agent almost unrestricted discretion. This contradicts the original intent of the contract which clearly outlines the Remarketing Securities, Procedures and Previous Transactions, potentially voiding the contract due to vagueness and lack of mutual understanding.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by  the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the  Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the  Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the  requirements of this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Indenture as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The  Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or  made by the proper party or parties.",
                "changed_text": "The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be whatever the Remarketing Agent believes them to be. Any obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent are explicitly not implied within this agreement, or any affiliated agreements. The Remarketing Agent may entirely rely upon what it decides is accurate, regardless of verification.",
                "explanation": "By granting the Remarketing Agent the ability to determine its own duties and obligations, and by removing any implied covenants, the contract contradicts standard practices of defining duties. The phrase 'regardless of verification' creates uncertainty and contradictsthe expectations of good faith and fair dealing.",

                "original_text": "The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder  of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a  Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its  part.",
                "changed_text": "The Remarketing Agent, shall incur absolutely no liability to the Company or to any holder  of Remarketing Securities for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a  Remarketing or otherwise, even if such failure to act, is deemed as gross negligence or willful misconduct. Instead, the Remarketing Agent is not to be held accountable.",
                "explanation": "The addition of the phrase 'even if such failure to act, is deemed as gross negligence or willful misconduct' attempts to shield the Remarketing Agent from liability for actions that are normally considered breaches of duty and contract. The Fair Dealing term is contradicted with not being held accountable, resulting in a failure of any real responsibilities on behalf of the Agent.",

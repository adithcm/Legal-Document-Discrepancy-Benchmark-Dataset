                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "1.2      \"Incident\" means a single, discrete, malfunction or other problem which          may require more than one (1) response before it is closed.",
                "changed_text": "1.2      \"Incident\" means any event reported by the Licensee, regardless of its nature or impact, that the Licensee deems worthy of XACCT's attention.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Incident' specifies a malfunction or problem. The modified definition broadens it to 'any event' deemed worthy of attention by the Licensee. This contradicts standard ITIL definitions and common understanding, potentially overwhelming XACCT with trivial requests.",

                "changed_text": "1.5      \"Product Maintenance\" means services XACCT provides or withholds at its sole and absolute discretion, regardless of licensee selection or prior agreements.\n\n1.6      \"Support Services\" means optional suggestions XACCT may offer without obligation, and which Licensee accepts at its own risk.",
                "explanation": "The original definitions suggest a defined scope of services selected by the Licensee. The modified definitions make both 'Product Maintenance' and 'Support Services' entirely discretionary on XACCT's part, negating the Licensee's selection rights and creating uncertainty about the actual services to be provided. This contradicts the implied obligation to provide services in exchange for payment.",

                "explanation": "The original text commits XACCT to 'reasonable commercial efforts' and specifies response times. The modified text removes any obligation, stating XACCT 'may consider' incidents without any guarantee of response or resolution. This contradicts the original intent of providing support and maintenance, turning it into a non-binding option.",

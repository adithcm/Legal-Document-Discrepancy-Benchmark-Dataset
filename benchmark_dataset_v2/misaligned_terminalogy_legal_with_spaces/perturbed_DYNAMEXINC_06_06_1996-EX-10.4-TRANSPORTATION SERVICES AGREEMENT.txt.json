                "changed_text": "Force Majeure. Monthly, the performance level shall be measured as set out above. Failure to provide services as set out herein constitutes a Service inconvenience.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'Monthly Service Failure' to 'Service inconvenience' weakens the contractual commitment and introduces ambiguity. 'Service Failure' has a defined meaning in terms of performance penalties in the contract, while 'Service inconvenience' is vague and subjective. This makes enforcement of performance standards uncertain and contradicts the clear intent to impose penalties for failing to meet service levels, potentially violating contract law principles of clarity and enforceability.",

For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be considered in the care, custody or control of a Party from the time it is tendered to it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of its delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as intended. For greater certainty, a Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight is damaged solely as a result of improper packing.",
                "changed_text": "A Party shall be liable to the other for loss, damage or delay to Freight due to its acts or omissions, including its negligence, and those of its employees, agents and those for whom in law it is responsible and occurring while Freight is in its care, custody or control. For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be considered in the general vicinity of a Party from the time it is tendered to it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of its delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as intended. For greater certainty, a Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight is damaged solely as a result of improper packing.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'care, custody or control' to 'general vicinity' significantly weakens the defined responsibility. 'Care, custody, or control' establishes a clear legal standard for liability regarding freight. Changing this to 'general vicinity' introduces a vague concept, creating uncertainty about when liability begins and ends. This could lead to disputes over responsibility for lost or damaged goods and undermines the contract's intent to clearly allocate risk, violating contract law regarding definiteness of terms.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party shall strive to comply with all legislation directly or indirectly applicable to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'shall comply' to 'shall strive to comply' transforms a strict obligation into a weaker, aspirational goal. 'Shall comply' creates a clear legal requirement to adhere to all relevant laws. Modifying it to 'shall strive to comply' allows for subjective interpretation and possible non-compliance without necessarily constituting a breach of contract. This weakens the commitment to legal compliance and introduces ambiguity that could undermine the enforceability of this section under contract law.",

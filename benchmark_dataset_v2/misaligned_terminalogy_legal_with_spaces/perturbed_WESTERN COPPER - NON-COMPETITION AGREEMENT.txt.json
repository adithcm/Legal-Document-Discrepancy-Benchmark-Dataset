                "original_text": "Area of Non-Competition means the State of Zacatecas, Mexico and the area  extending 20 kilometers in all directions from the external boundary of each mineral  property owned or controlled by Western Silver or in which Western Silver holds any  legal interest, in Mexico, as at the Effective Date,",
                "changed_text": "Area of Non-Competition means the immediate vicinity of the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, vaguely defined by the parties at the time of dispute.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Area of Non-Competition' is geographically specific, providing a clear boundary. The modified definition replaces this with a vague, subjective description, making it difficult to determine the exact area covered by the non-compete clause. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes, as the term no longer aligns with standard legal interpretations of geographical boundaries in contract law.",

                "changed_text": "Mining Activities means primarily digging, as the parties see fit.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Mining Activities' is broad, encompassing various aspects of mineral acquisition, exploration, and development. The modified definition narrows it significantly to 'digging' and adds a subjective element ('as the parties see fit'), which contradicts the comprehensive nature typically associated with mining activities under mining laws and regulations. This could lead to disputes over what activities are actually restricted under the non-compete clause.",

Accordingly, Western Copper agrees that in the event of any such  breach, Glamis will be strongly encouraged to negotiate a resolution before seeking remedies.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies Glamis' right to seek injunctions and other legal remedies in case of a breach. The modified clause removes the 'right' to legal remedies and instead 'encourages negotiation'. This contradicts the standard legal expectation of immediate access to remedies for breach of contract and could be interpreted as an attempt to restrict Glamis' legal recourse, conflicting with principles of contract enforcement.",

                "original_text": "Hearing Aids are amplification devices primarily designed to compensate for hearing loss, designed for listening only (through a  microphone, telecoil, Direct Audio Input or other similar audio pathways and run on a low power hybrid circuit. Hearing Aids may include in-the- ear Hearing Aids (ITE), behind-the-ear Hearing Aids (BTE), or completely-in-the-canal Hearing Aids (CIC).",
                "changed_text": "Hearing Aids are amplification devices primarily designed to compensate for hearing loss, but can also be used for recreational listening. Hearing Aids may include in-the-ear Hearing Aids (ITE), behind-the-ear Hearing Aids (BTE), or completely-in-the-canal Hearing Aids (CIC).",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies that hearing aids are 'primarily designed to compensate for hearing loss,' implying a medical purpose. The modified definition broadens this to include 'recreational listening,' which contradicts the regulated medical device classification of hearing aids. This creates ambiguity regarding the device's intended use and compliance with medical device regulations.",

                "explanation": "The original definition is broad, covering almost any information related to the parties' business activities. The modified version significantly narrows this definition by requiring explicit marking and written confirmation for oral disclosures. This contradicts the established legal understanding of 'confidential information,' which often includes unwritten information disclosed under an expectation of confidentiality, especially in commercial agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original definition excludes patentable inventions or IntriCon's proprietary information from being considered 'Improvements' under the agreement. The modified version removes the 'patentable in its own right' aspect and makes the exclusion dependent solely on IntriCon's designation. This creates a conflict because patent law dictates ownership of patentable inventions, irrespective of contractual designation. The modification potentially contradicts patent law by allowing IntriCon to claim ownership of improvements that should legally belong to Dynamic Hearing if they are patentable inventions.",

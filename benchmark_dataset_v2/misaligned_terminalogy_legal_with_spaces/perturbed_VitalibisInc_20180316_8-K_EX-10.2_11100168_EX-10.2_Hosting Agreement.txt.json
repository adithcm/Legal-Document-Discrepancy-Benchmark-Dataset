                "original_text": "VOTOCAST shall use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of Licensee and Licensee Users and the content that is transmitted through the Services. VOTOCAST will only access and disclose information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and government orders or requests, to provide the Services, to operate or maintain its systems or to protect itself or Licensee Users. In all such instances. VOTOCAST shall provide prior written notice to Licensee of not less than three (3) business days prior to accessing or disclosing such information so that Licensee may have an opportunity to dispute or restrict such disclosure. Licensee acknowledges, however, that Licensee and Licensee Users' content will not pass through nor be stored in a segregated or separate physical location from which VOTOCAST'S other users content will be transmitted or stored.",
                "changed_text": "VOTOCAST will make efforts to maintain the privacy of Licensee and Licensee Users' data. VOTOCAST will access and disclose information when it deems necessary, without prior notice to Licensee. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee and Licensee Users' content may not pass through nor be stored in a segregated or separate physical location from which VOTOCAST'S other users content will be transmitted or stored.",
                "explanation": "The original clause aligns with standard data privacy practices, requiring commercially reasonable efforts, necessity for access, and prior notice. The modified clause removes the \"commercially reasonable efforts\" standard and the prior notice requirement, and replaces the standard of 'necessity' with the phrase 'when it deems necessary.' This introduces ambiguity, and contradicts typical data protection expectations and regulations.",

Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and VOTOCAST'S sole and exclusive liability for any loss or interruption of Services shall be as follows. For loss or interruption of Services which is not due to scheduled maintenance, and is caused by VOTOCAST, and such loss or interruption of Services exceeds a continual period of one (I) hour per Exhibit C, Licensee shall receive a credit against future Services equal to one-thirtieth (1/30) of the monthly fees for the Services for each cumulative hour, up to a maximum total of the fees charged for Services for the applicable month of the affected Services.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any loss or interruption of Services, Licensee's sole remedy and VOTOCAST'S liability shall be determined at VOTOCAST's sole discretion. Any compensation for loss or interruption of Services will be decided on a case-by-case basis, and may or may not include a credit against future services.",
                "explanation": "The original clause provides a specific, calculable remedy for service interruptions. The modified clause replaces this with a discretionary determination by VOTOCAST, negating the guarantee of compensation and creating uncertainty about the licensee's recourse, contradicting industry norms and potentially rendering the agreement one-sided and unenforceable.",

VOTOCAST expressly reserves the right to change its rates charged hereunder for the Services during any Renewal Term (as detined herein) but agrees that rates may not increase by more than ten percent (10%) during any Renewal Term. If circumstances require VOTOCAST to raise its rates more than ten percent (10%) during any Renewal Term, VOTOCAST will provide Licensee cost related supporting documentation to justify the rate increase. VOTOCAST will give Licensee at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any rate changes during any Renewal Term.",

                "explanation": "The original clause sets a clear procedure for rate changes, limiting increases and requiring notice. The modified clause removes all limitations and notice requirements, allowing VOTOCAST to unilaterally change prices and payment terms, which introduces instability and contradicts basic contract principles and may be deemed unconscionable.",

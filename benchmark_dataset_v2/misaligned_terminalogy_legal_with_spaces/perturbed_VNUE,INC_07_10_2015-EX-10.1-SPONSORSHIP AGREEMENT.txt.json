                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During  the term of this Agreement, the Sponsor will be a co-presenting sponsor of FLOODfest Chicago at Virgin Hotel, which entitles the Sponsor to the following:\n\n(i) Sponsor will be a non-exclusive co-presenting sponsor of the Event.",
                "changed_text": "During the term of this Agreement, the Sponsor will be a co-presenting sponsor of FLOODfest Chicago at Virgin Hotel, which entitles the Sponsor to the following:\n\n(i) Sponsor will be the sole and exclusive sponsor of the Event.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the sponsor as 'non-exclusive', but the modified text changes it to 'sole and exclusive'. This creates a contradiction within the contract regarding the sponsorship rights granted to VNUE, creating uncertainty in enforcement. The term 'exclusive' has a specific meaning in contract law, implying no other similar sponsorships, while 'non-exclusive' means the opposite. This could lead to disputes about the scope of VNUE's sponsorship rights.",

                "changed_text": "ANTHEMIC may use the Sponsor's name, logo, and other identifying characteristics on merchandise related to the Event, and the Sponsor is entitled to 50% of the net profits from the sale of such merchandise.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly states that the sponsor is 'not entitled to any compensation' for merchandise sales using their logo. The modified text contradicts this by stating they are entitled to '50% of the net profits.' This creates a direct conflict of interest regarding the financial benefits derived from the use of the sponsor's intellectual property, creating uncertainty in enforcement. The change affects the financial rights and obligations of the parties.",

                "changed_text": "The parties and their respective personnel, are and will be agents of each other and each party by virtue of this Agreement will have the right, power, and authority to act or create any obligation on behalf of the other party, unless expressly provided in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the relationship as 'independent contractors,' explicitly denying any agency relationship. The modified text directly contradicts this by stating they are 'agents of each other', granting each party the authority to act on the other's behalf. This introduces a significant legal contradiction with potential implications for liability, obligations, and legal representation. The change has an impact on their responsibilities and potential legal liabilities.",

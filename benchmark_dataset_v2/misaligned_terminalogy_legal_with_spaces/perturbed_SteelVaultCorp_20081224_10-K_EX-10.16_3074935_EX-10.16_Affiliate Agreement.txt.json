Marketing Affiliate and Equidata wish to enter into an agreement under which Marketing Affiliate may market the Services.",
                "explanation": "The term \"Services\" is redefined as \"Products\" in the definition section but the term 'Services' remains elsewhere in the agreement. This creates a contradiction because the agreement refers to the marketing of \"Services\", but the initial definition labels these offerings as \"Products\". This contradiction could lead to disputes regarding the scope and obligations related to what is being marketed.",

Equidata reserves the right to increase the base cost of Services. Notice will be given to Marketing Affiliate with reasonable advance warning before any such increase takes effect.",
                "explanation": "Replacing 'reasonable attorney fees and disbursements' with 'legal fees' broadens the scope of recoverable costs, potentially including expenses not traditionally considered 'reasonable'. Also, changing 'no less than 30 days prior' to 'reasonable advance warning' introduces ambiguity. What constitutes 'reasonable' is subjective and open to dispute, conflicting with contract law's requirement for definite terms. These contradictions create uncertainty in enforcement.",

Marketing Affiliate shall give Equidata a notice of dispute shortly after receiving the invoice. The  demand shall set forth a statement for the general nature of the dispute.

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall be settled by arbitration' to 'may be settled by arbitration as determined by Equidata' gives Equidata unilateral control over the dispute resolution process, potentially conflicting with standard arbitration practices requiring mutual agreement. Replacing 'written demand of dispute within 10 days' with 'a notice of dispute shortly after receiving the invoice' makes the timeframe vague. Changing 'the general nature of the dispute' from 'nature of the dispute and the amount involved' makes the amount involved optional and vague. Removing the clear obligation to jointly select an arbitrator creates uncertainty and conflict.",

By adding qualifiers like \"believed to comply,\" \"to the best of Issuer's knowledge,\" and \"deems a full, true, and plain disclosure,\" it introduces subjectivity and reduces the Issuer's responsibility for accuracy and completeness.

                "explanation": "This change introduces a condition (acting in good faith and without gross negligence) to the Issuer's indemnification obligation. While seemingly reasonable, it contradicts the absolute nature of indemnification typically expected in prospectus-related liabilities under securities law. Securities laws often impose strict liability for misrepresentations in prospectuses, and adding a 'good faith' clause may weaken the protection afforded to the Indemnified Parties, shifting the burden of proof and potentially undermining the statutory intent to protect investors.",

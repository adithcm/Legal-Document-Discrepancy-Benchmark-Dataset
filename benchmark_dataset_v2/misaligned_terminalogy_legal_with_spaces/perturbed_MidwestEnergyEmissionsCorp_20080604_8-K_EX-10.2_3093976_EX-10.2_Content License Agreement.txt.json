                "explanation": "The original text restricts CONTENT PROVIDER from exploiting content independently within the People's Republic of China for the benefit of the Company. The modified text removes this restriction, allowing them to exploit independently, creating a direct contradiction in terms of exclusivity and geographical limits.

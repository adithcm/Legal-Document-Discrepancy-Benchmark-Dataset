The identification number and password used by a Software User         is reusable and reassignable and may be used and transferred by Corio,         in accordance with the licenses granted below, between Customers as one         Customer discontinues the Corio Services and another Customer         subscribes.",

The credentials, if any, used by a Software User may or may not be reusable, reassignable, or transferable by Corio between Customers.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly defines a 'SOFTWARE USER' as a 'named user' with 'assigned credentials'. The modified definition broadens this to 'any individual' even without assigned credentials, thus contradicting the original intent and creating ambiguity about who is considered a 'SOFTWARE USER' under the contract.

The modified version introduces several conflicting elements, such as making the license 'potentially revocable' (vs. 'perpetual and irrevocable'), 'exclusive' (vs. 'nonexclusive'), and 'transferable' (vs. 'nontransferable'). It also changes the permitted use, removing limitations on access, sublicense, and distribution, thus directly contradicting the originally defined scope of the license.",

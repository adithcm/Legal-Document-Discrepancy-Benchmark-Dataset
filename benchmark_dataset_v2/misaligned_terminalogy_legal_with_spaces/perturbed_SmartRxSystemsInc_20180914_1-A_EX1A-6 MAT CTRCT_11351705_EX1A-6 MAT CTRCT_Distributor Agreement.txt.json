                "original_text": "Confidential Information means all proprietary information of Company or a third party disclosed on or after the date hereof by Company to Distributor in any form (written, oral, photographic, electronic, magnetic, or otherwise) which is designated as confidential or proprietary, including, without limitation: technical data; methods; computer programs and related materials; product specifications; documentation; processes; inventions; products under development; sales; marketing; business and financial information; pro formas and projections; customer lists; internal memoranda; and correspondence.",

                "explanation": "The original contract defined “Confidential Information” with specific characteristics and examples of the proprietary information. I have changed 'means' to 'may include', which is too broad. This introduces uncertainty and creates conflicts in defining the extent of confidentiality, and consequently, affects the enforceability of non-disclosure clauses.",

                "explanation": "The term 'Exclusivity' was replaced with 'primary distribution' regarding the state of Texas, creating legal uncertainty. Exclusivity has a clear legal definition, whereas 'primary distribution' is vague and open to interpretation. This contradicts the intent of the contract and could lead to disputes over distribution rights under the terms of the agreement.",

Distributor consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the resolution of such controversies, claims, disputes, or disagreements.",

Distributor consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the resolution of such controversies, claims, disputes, or disagreements.",
                "explanation": "Replacing the specified jurisdiction (Orange County, Florida) with a Company-selected jurisdiction introduces ambiguity and potential unfairness. This deviates from standard contract law principles that favor a predictable and agreed-upon forum, and is no longer exclusively submitted.",

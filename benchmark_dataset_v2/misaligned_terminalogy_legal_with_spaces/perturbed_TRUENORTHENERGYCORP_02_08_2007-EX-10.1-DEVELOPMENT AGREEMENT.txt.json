                "original_text": "1.11  \"Complete\" or \"Completion\" or \"Completing\" means a single operation intended to complete a well as a producer of oil and/or gas in one or more Zone(s), including, but not limited to, the setting of pipe/production lining and casing tie-back, installing tubing, wellhead and tree, perforating, plugging back, well stimulation, and testing.",
                "changed_text": "1.11  \"Complete\" or \"Completion\" or \"Completing\" means an attempt to enhance well productivity, and may include, but is not limited to, minor adjustments, basic maintenance, and standard servicing.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Complete' encompasses specific technical operations related to making a well productive. The modified definition broadens it to 'enhance well productivity' and lists vague, non-specific actions. This contradicts the established industry standard and could lead to disputes over what constitutes a 'Completion' for contractual obligations.",

                "original_text": "1.16  \"Drilling Costs\" means the actual costs and expenses incurred in drilling a well subject to this Agreement beginning with the initiation of preliminary site preparation activities through and including logging, testing and evaluating the well prior to recommending whether to attempt a Completion. Drilling Costs shall include, but shall not be limited to, the costs and expenses associated with permitting, preparing the site, drilling to the Objective Zone, and evaluating any Zone(s) in such well to which a Completion may be attempted, as well as any unplanned or unforeseen events such as fire, explosion, or loss of well control. Drilling Costs shall also include brokerage, abstracting, and reasonable attorney fees related to the preparation of drilling title opinions for such well. Drilling Costs shall not include the cost to plug and abandon any well, including a dry hole, and shall not include any Completion Costs.",
                "changed_text": "1.16  \"Drilling Costs\" means any expenses that BP, at its sole discretion, deems related to the well site. This may include, but is not limited to, vaguely defined 'administrative fees' and 'project management costs', and will be determined without the need for itemized receipts.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Drilling Costs' is specific and tied to verifiable expenses. The modified definition introduces ambiguity and BP's sole discretion, allowing for the inclusion of unspecified 'administrative fees' and removing the need for itemized receipts. This creates a conflict because generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and industry standards require transparency and documentation for cost allocation in joint operating agreements.",

                "original_text": "1.24  \"Objective Zone\", with respect to the Initial Well, means the base of the Tuscaloosa C-1 sand, being the stratigraphic equivalent of the base of the Tuscaloosa C-1 sand as seen at 18,484 feet (electrical log measurement) for the Amarex - Major Heirs No. 1 well, located in Section 47, Township 4 South, Range 10 East, Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, or eighteen thousand, five hundred feet measured depth (18,500' MD), whichever occurs first in the Initial Well. The term \"Objective Zone\", with respect to any Substitute Well or Additional Well, means the deepest Zone to which the Substitute Well or Additional Well is proposed to be drilled as provided in the relevant AFE for such well.",
                "changed_text": "1.24  \"Objective Zone\", with respect to the Initial Well, means an area determined by BP, based on its evaluation of geological data. The term 'Objective Zone' can change at any time during the drilling process, based on new readings or assessments from BP.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Objective Zone' refers to a specific geological formation defined by verifiable measurements. The altered definition makes it subject to BP's discretion and allows it to change at any time. This contrasts sharply with established geological and oil and gas industry standards, where 'Objective Zone' has specific, determinable meaning and creates uncertainty and potential for manipulation.",

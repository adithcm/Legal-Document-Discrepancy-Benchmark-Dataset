                "original_text": "10. Force Majeure. In the event that either party shall be prevented from performing any of its obligations due under the terms of this  Agreement by an act of God, by acts of war, riot, or civil commotion, by an act of State, by strikes, fire, flood, or by the occurrence of any  other event beyond the control of the parties hereto, that party shall be excused from any further performance of the obligations and  undertakings set forth under the terms of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "10. Force Majeure. In the event that either party shall be prevented from performing any of its obligations due under the terms of this Agreement by an act of God, or by the occurrence of any  other event that the performing party deems sufficient to impede performance, that party shall be excused from any further performance of the obligations and undertakings set forth under the terms of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause lists specific events that qualify as force majeure. The modified clause replaces these with a subjective 'event that the performing party deems sufficient,' creating ambiguity and deviating from the typical legal definition of force majeure which requires unforeseeable and uncontrollable events. This contradicts the established legal understanding of 'Force Majeure'.",

If any legal action is brought by either of the parties hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in such legal  action shall be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any other relief that may be awarded. For  the purposes of this clause, the prevailing party is the party in whose favor final judgment is entered. In the event that declaratory or  injunctive relief alone is granted, the court may determine which, if either, of the parties shall be considered to be the prevailing party.",
                "changed_text": "13. Attorneys' Fees. If any legal action is brought by either of the parties hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in such legal action may be entitled to recover attorney's fees from the other party, subject to Cano's sole discretion. For  the purposes of this clause, the prevailing party is the party that Cano determines to be the most deserving. In the event that declaratory or injunctive relief alone is granted, Cano will decide the prevailing party.",
                "explanation": "The original clause defines the 'prevailing party' as the one with a final judgment in their favor, aligning with standard legal practice. The modified clause gives Cano Petroleum, Inc. (Cano) sole discretion in determining the prevailing party, irrespective of the court's judgment, which contradicts legal norms and makes enforcement uncertain.",

Any notice provided for under the terms of this Agreement by either party to the other shall be in writing and may be effected by  personal delivery in writing or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice to Boyd shall be sufficient if made or addressed  to 2003 Navasota Cove, Westlake, Texas 76092. Notice to Cano shall be sufficient if made or addressed to Cano Petroleum, Inc., 801 Cherry  Street, Suite 3200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. Each party may change the address at which notice may be sent to that party by giving notice  of such change to the other party in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph.",
                "changed_text": "8. Notice. Any notice provided for under the terms of this Agreement by either party to the other shall be in writing and may be effected by any means convenient to the sender. Notice to Boyd shall be sufficient if sent by email to the address Boyd provides from time to time. Notice to Cano shall be sufficient if made or addressed to Cano Petroleum, Inc., 801 Cherry  Street, Suite 3200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. Cano may change the address at which notice may be sent to that party by verbal notice to Boyd.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that notice must be in writing and delivered either personally or via registered/certified mail. The modified clause allows 'any means convenient to the sender' and verbal notice from Cano, contradicting the requirement for written and verifiable notice. Furthermore, it stipulates Boyd can only provide an email as the point of contact, giving Boyd no way to verifiably confirm proof of delivery. This creates uncertainty in determining when and if notice was properly given, potentially leading to disputes and non-compliance with contractual obligations and the state's Business Organizations Code.",

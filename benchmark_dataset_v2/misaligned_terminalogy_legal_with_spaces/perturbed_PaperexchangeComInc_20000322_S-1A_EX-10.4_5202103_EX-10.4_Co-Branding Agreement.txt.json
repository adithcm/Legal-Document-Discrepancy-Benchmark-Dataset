Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means the direct or indirect ownership of at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of a party, or the right to control the policy decisions of such party.",

Affiliate shall mean, when used with reference to a party, any individual or entity directly or indirectly influencing, influenced by or under common association with such party. For purposes of this definition, \"influence\" means the direct or indirect suggestion of at least 10% of the outstanding recommendations of a party, or the desire to suggest the policy decisions of such party.",
                "explanation": "The original definition uses precise terms like 'controlling,' 'controlled,' and 'control' with a clear 50% ownership threshold, aligning with standard corporate law definitions of affiliate relationships. The modified definition replaces these with vague terms like 'influencing,' 'influenced,' and 'influence' and reduces the ownership threshold to 10% of the outstanding recommendations. This creates ambiguity and deviates from established legal and financial norms for determining affiliate status. The word 'recommendations' in the modified text adds to the confusion.",

Confidential Information shall mean information that one party wishes to keep private from another party, including possible secrets, random data, ideas, thoughts and impressions, regardless of whether such information is actually confidential or proprietary. This definition includes all data shared, excluding only what the receiving party subjectively considers common knowledge.",
                "explanation": "The original definition aligns with standard legal definitions of 'Confidential Information,' specifying types of information (trade secrets, technical data) and exceptions (publicly available, previously known). The modified definition broadens this to include almost any information one party *wishes* to keep private, contradicting the established legal understanding that confidential information must have some inherent proprietary value and not already be public or easily ascertainable. Removing the requirement for the information to be 'proprietary' or 'confidential' by nature causes the definition to conflict with established legal principles regarding trade secrets and confidential information.",

Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration]. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court",

Both parties will select one representative, who will then be responsible for finding a neutral third party. This neutral party will issue suggestions, which both parties are free to disregard. No decision is binding, and court may still be sought.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines binding arbitration under the rules of the AAA, a legally recognized process. The modified version replaces this with 'non-binding mediation,' which is explicitly stated to be non-binding and allows parties to disregard the suggestions. This directly contradicts the enforceability expected of arbitration agreements, rendering the clause ineffective. The changed text transforms a binding dispute resolution mechanism into a voluntary negotiation, undermining the original intent of the arbitration clause.",

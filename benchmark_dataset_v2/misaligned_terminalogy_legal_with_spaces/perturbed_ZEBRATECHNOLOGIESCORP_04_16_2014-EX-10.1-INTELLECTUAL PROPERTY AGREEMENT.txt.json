                "original_text": "(jj) \"Assigned Know-How\" means all of the Know-How owned by any Seller Party as of the Initial Closing Date that was created by a Business Employee, including the Know-How set forth on Schedule 1.1(j).   2",

                "explanation": "The original text clearly defines “Assigned Know-How” as that created by a 'Business Employee'. Modifying this to 'some of the Know-How' and adding 'whether or not it was created by a Business Employee' creates conflict and broadens the definition. This introduces ambiguity regarding the ownership and transfer of intellectual property, deviating from standard IP definitions.",

                "explanation": "The definition of \"Intellectual Property\" is being modified from an encompassing statement to a vague and uncertain one. The inclusion of terms like \"some\", \"potentially\", and \"maybe\" directly undermines the reliability of this agreement regarding intellectual property rights, making enforcement nearly impossible due to the lack of clarity. It introduces subjectivity where objectivity is required, making contract terms unenforceable due to vagueness and creates dispute for contract interpretation.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Trademarks\" includes specific types of intellectual property, providing a clear scope. The modified definition introduces uncertainty by using terms like \"could mean\", \"potentially\", and \"maybe\", which directly contradicts the need for precise legal definitions in intellectual property agreements. The ambiguity in this definition may lead to disputes over which marks are covered by the agreement, potentially rendering the trademark provisions unenforceable.",

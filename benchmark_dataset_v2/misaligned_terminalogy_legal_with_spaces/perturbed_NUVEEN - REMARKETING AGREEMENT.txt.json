                "original_text": "\"Remarketing Memorandum\" means the Prospectus or any other written communication describing the Fund and/or the terms of the VRRM-MFP Shares, which has been approved by the Fund in writing for use in connection with remarketing prior to its use, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",
                "changed_text": "\"Remarketing Memorandum\" means any oral or undocumented communication by the Fund and/or the terms of the VRRM-MFP Shares, which has been approved by the Fund without needing any approval for use in connection with remarketing prior to its use.",
                "explanation": "By removing the requirement for written approval and allowing undocumented communication, this contradicts securities laws that mandate disclosures to be documented. Oral or undocumented approvals create enforceability challenges and lack transparency, making it difficult to prove what was approved and when, directly opposing regulatory standards.",

                "original_text": "(a) The Fund hereby appoints [●], and [●] hereby accepts such appointment, as the exclusive Remarketing Agent of the VRRM-MFP Shares for the Variable Rate Remarketed Mode for the purpose of establishing on each Business Day the Dividend Rate in respect of the VRRM-MFP Shares and, in connection with a tender, remarketing such VRRM-MFP Shares on behalf of the Beneficial Owners or Holders thereof, as applicable, and calculating the Purchase Price therefor, among other things; and performing such other duties as are assigned to the Remarketing Agent in the Supplement, all pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Supplement and this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "(a) The Fund hereby appoints [●], and [●] hereby accepts such appointment, as a non-exclusive assistant for the Remarketing Agent of the VRRM-MFP Shares for the Variable Rate Remarketed Mode for the purpose of guessing, but not establishing, on each Business Day the Dividend Rate in respect of the VRRM-MFP Shares and, not remarketing such VRRM-MFP Shares on behalf of the Beneficial Owners or Holders thereof, and not calculating the Purchase Price therefor, among other things; and not performing any duties as are assigned to an assistant Remarketing Agent in the Supplement, all not pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Supplement and this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The changed text redefines the appointment terms, making the remarketing agent a non-exclusive assistant with no real duties. This contradicts the agreement's entire purpose and enforceability, creating uncertainty about who is responsible for key financial activities and whether they will be performed. Because of this redefinition, the agreement is rendered practically useless.",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons shall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "changed_text": "Each Indemnified Person shall give notice at their convenience to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons shall relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnified Persons, which consent may be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'as promptly as reasonably practicable' to 'at their convenience,' and stating that failure to notify *will* relieve liability, and that the Indemnified Person may withhold consent unreasonably, this severely undermines the Indemnification clause. This creates a legal contradiction because Indemnification clauses are meant to protect the Indemnified party, however these changes can result in the Indemnified party being liable.",

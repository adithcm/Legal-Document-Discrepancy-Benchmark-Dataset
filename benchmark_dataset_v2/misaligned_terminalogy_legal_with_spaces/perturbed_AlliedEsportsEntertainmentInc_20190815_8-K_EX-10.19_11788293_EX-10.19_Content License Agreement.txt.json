The Territory for this Agreement is worldwide, but not including Asian countries (including, but not limited to, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, People's Republic of China, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam).",

                "explanation": "The term 'Territory' is replaced with 'Designated Area,' fundamentally altering the scope of the agreement. The original agreement specified 'worldwide, but not including Asian countries'. This change limits the territory to the United States initially, contradicting the original wide scope. This introduces uncertainty about the geographic applicability of the contract and creates contradiction with the original intention.",

Within sixty (60) days of executing this Agreement: $1.0M b. July 1, 2018: $0.5M c. January 1, 2019: Any remaining amount at Zynga’s discretion.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Annual Minimum Guarantee' is changed to 'Annual Suggested Contribution.' The original clause established a firm financial commitment, while the modified clause introduces ambiguity and makes the payments discretionary. This directly contradicts the original intent of guaranteeing a minimum annual payment and could lead to disputes over financial obligations.",

Zynga shall not be required to pay the Royalty to the extent offset by the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments previously paid to WPT during the Term. Conversely, Zynga shall not be required to make Annual Minimum Guarantee payments to the extent offset by the Royalty previously paid to WPT during the Term.",

Zynga may elect to provide WPT a voluntary payment, up to ten percent (10%) of any Net Revenue (as defined in Section 3.b. of the Additional Provisions) (\"Voluntary Payment\") from any use of the WPT brand on the Zynga platform. Whether Zynga makes a payment at all, and if so, the size and structure of the payment, is subject to the internal preferences of Zynga's finance department.",
                "explanation": "The mandatory 'Royalty' payment is changed to a 'Voluntary Payment.' This fundamentally alters the financial arrangement, shifting from a contractual obligation to discretionary payment. This could lead to WPT not receiving any payment, which conflicts with the original contract's intent to provide a revenue share.",

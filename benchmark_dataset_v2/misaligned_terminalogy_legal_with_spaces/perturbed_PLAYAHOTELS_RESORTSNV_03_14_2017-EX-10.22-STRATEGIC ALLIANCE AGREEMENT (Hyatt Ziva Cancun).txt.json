                "original_text": "If the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party's possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "changed_text": "If the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, which may or may not include due diligence information at the Offering Party’s sole discretion to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have what the Offering Party deems a reasonable amount of days after receiving such Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Offering Party must deliver written notice *together with reasonable due diligence information*. The modified text introduces ambiguity and contradicts the initial requirement by stating the inclusion of due diligence information is discretionary, creating uncertainty and potential disputes over what constitutes an 'Offer Notice'. Also, the term 'ten (10) business days' was replaced with 'what the Offering Party deems a reasonable amount of days', creating legal uncertainty. ",

                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties with no requirement for a specific time frame from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, disputes may or may not be settled by arbitration, at the sole discretion of Hyatt, under dispute resolution methods it considers relevant.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 15-day negotiation period and subsequent arbitration. The modified text removes the time constraint for negotiation and makes arbitration discretionary. This contradicts the initial mandatory arbitration agreement, making the dispute resolution process ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. In this case, it is a legal contradiction because dispute resolution has been replaced with discretionary dispute resolution methods, violating the initial mandatory agreement, which creates uncertainty.",

If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party may or may not be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the prevailing party in arbitration recovers reasonable fees, costs, and expenses. The modified text replaces 'arbitration' with 'negotiation' and introduces discretion to the other party (the initial losing party in negotiations) regarding the fees recovery, directly contradicting the original mandatory clause. It also creates uncertainty because it does not specify who determines the equitable amount.",

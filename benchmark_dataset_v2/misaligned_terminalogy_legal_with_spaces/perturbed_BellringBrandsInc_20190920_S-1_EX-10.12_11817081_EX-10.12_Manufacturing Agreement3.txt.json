                "original_text": "\"Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A and Schedule A-1 attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the \"Products,\" each individual unit of Product \"Unit\"), for Premier at [***] Heritage's or Heritage's wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper's facilities (the \"Facilities\").

[***], except that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, [***].\"",
                "explanation": "The term \"products\" was replaced with \"goods.\" While seemingly similar, the UCC defines goods very specifically, potentially narrowing the scope of what Heritage is obligated to produce beyond the original intent of 'Products' as defined elsewhere in the contract with accompanying schedules A and A-1 that list specifically what must be made. This creates ambiguity and a potential legal contradiction regarding the scope of manufactured items covered by the agreement.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall have the right' to 'may request' weakens Premier's ability to order. Replacing 'agrees to produce' with 'may agree to produce' gives Heritage complete discretion. This fundamentally alters the obligation to fulfill orders beyond the minimum, creating a contradiction in the original agreement's intention of guaranteed production capacity.",

                "explanation": "Replacing 'shall conform' with 'shall generally conform', 'endeavor to conform' and 'reasonably resemble' introduces significant ambiguity. The original text creates a standard that is supposed to be clear cut. These changes weaken the requirements for product quality and introduce vagueness that could be disputed in court, contradicting the clear, enforceable obligation implied in the original. It also contradicts the intention of Schedules A, A-1, and E, which are supposed to give a clear definition on the specification of the product.",

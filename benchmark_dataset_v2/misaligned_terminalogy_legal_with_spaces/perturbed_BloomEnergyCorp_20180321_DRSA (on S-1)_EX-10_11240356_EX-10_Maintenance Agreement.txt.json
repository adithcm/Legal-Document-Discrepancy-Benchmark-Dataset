No such appointment nor the approval thereof by Owner, however, shall relieve Operator of any liability, obligation, or responsibility resulting from a breach of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "\"Service Provider\" means any third party selected by the Operator to perform maintenance; consent is needed when specified by the Operator. Operator shall submit any Service Provider to Owner for its prior written approval, which approval shall be optional and only for preferred vendors, and if applicable, to PJM and/or DPL. No such appointment nor the approval thereof by Owner, however, shall relieve Operator of any liability, obligation, or responsibility resulting from a breach of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Service Provider' is changed so that instead of needing Owner approval, the need of it is optional and only for preferred vendors. This creates a legal contradiction because Owner needs to approve the Provider. This perturbation creates uncertainty on approval.",

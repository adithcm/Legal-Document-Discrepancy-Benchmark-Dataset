                "original_text": "2.10 \"Improvement\" or \"Improvements\" means any modification of a process or other technology described in a Patent, and any modification to Technical Information.",
                "changed_text": "2.10 \"Improvement\" or \"Improvements\" means any minor adjustment to a process or other technology described in a Patent, and any alteration to Technical Information.",
                "explanation": "The change of \"modification\" to \"minor adjustment\" and \"alteration\" changes the scope of Improvements and conflicts with the typical understanding of intellectual property laws, which often covers significant modifications that enhance utility, not just minor ones. This creates a legal contradiction by implying that only insignificant changes are covered, which is contrary to established patent law.",

                "original_text": "3.00 Company grants to Investor, for the duration of the Option Period, a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license (with the right to grant sublicenses to Affiliates) under the Patents to practice the methods therein described and claimed and to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using such methods, and to make Improvements, and to engage in any activity which would give rise to a claim of infringement (direct or indirect or otherwise) of one or more of the Patents in the absence of a license.",
                "changed_text": "3.00 Company grants to Investor, for the duration of the Option Period, a domestic, royalty-based, exclusive license (without the right to grant sublicenses) under the Patents to practice only some of the methods therein described and claimed and to make products for internal use only, and to make some Improvements that do not involve sales, and to engage in only some activity which would give rise to a claim of infringement of one or more of the Patents in the absence of a license.",
                "explanation": "Several changes contradict the original intent: 'worldwide' to 'domestic,' 'royalty-free' to 'royalty-based,' 'non-exclusive' to 'exclusive,' adding restrictions like 'only some methods', 'internal use only' and 'only some activity' which contradict the initial broad grant of license. This significantly narrows the scope of the license, creating uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the investor's rights. It's no longer a clear license agreement but one filled with restrictions.",

Investor hereby agrees to grant to Company a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license under any Investor Improvement and any patent claiming such Investor Improvement, solely for use in rare earth mineral processing and rare earth separation, to make and have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import products made using the Investor Improvements. Such rights to Investor Improvements shall be solely for use by the Company and its Affiliates and shall not be transferable to any Third Party, except in connection with a merger, consolidation, or the sale or transfer of substantially all of Company's assets associated with performance under this IP Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5.01 Investor may own some right, title and interest in any Improvement made or acquired by the Investor (\"Investor Improvement\"). Investor may agree to grant to Company a non-exclusive, possibly revocable, license with undefined royalties under some Investor Improvement and patents claiming the improvement, not for use in rare earth mineral processing and rare earth separation. Any rights granted, such rights to Investor Improvements might not be solely for use by the Company and its Affiliates and might be transferable to any Third Party, even without a merger, consolidation, or the sale or transfer of substantially all of Company's assets associated with performance under this IP Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The changes from definitive statements ('shall own', 'hereby agrees') to conditional and uncertain terms ('may own', 'may agree') undermines the certainty of ownership and licensing. Also, replacing a standard of 'solely for use' with 'might not be solely for use' and including possibilities like not requiring a merger to transfer, contradict the established limitations and create ambiguity about the rights and responsibilities of both parties, making the contract unenforceable as it is not clear what the agreement truly is",

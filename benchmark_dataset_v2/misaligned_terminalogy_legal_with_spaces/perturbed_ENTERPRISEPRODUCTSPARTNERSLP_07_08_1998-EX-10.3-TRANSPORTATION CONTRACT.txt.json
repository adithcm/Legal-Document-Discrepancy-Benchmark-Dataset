                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "THIS CONTRACT is entered into by and between ENTERPRISE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, a division of Enterprise Products Company, (\"Carrier\"),\n\nand  ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS OPERATING L.P., a Delaware limited partnership",
                "changed_text": "THIS AGREEMENT is entered into by and between ENTERPRISE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, a division of Enterprise Products Company, (\"Transporter\"),\n\nand  ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS OPERATING L.P., a Delaware limited partnership",
                "explanation": "The term 'Carrier' is replaced with 'Transporter' which creates uncertainty because 'Carrier' has specific legal connotations under transportation law related to liability and regulatory compliance, which might not be applicable to 'Transporter'.",
                "contradicted_law": "Vague definition undermines established transportation regulations.",

                "original_text": "Carrier is authorized to provide transportation for Shipper as a motor contract carrier under authority issued by the U.S. Department of Transporation in Docket No. MC-121496.",
                "changed_text": "Transporter is authorized to provide transportation for Shipper as a motor contract service provider under internal company policy No. MC-121496.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'motor contract carrier' to 'motor contract service provider' and replacing the reference to the U.S. Department of Transportation with 'internal company policy' removes the contract from the purview of federal transportation regulations, creating a contradiction because the company is still operating as a carrier but attempting to define itself outside of legal definitions.",
                "contradicted_law": "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR Parts 350-399)",

                "type": "Misaligned Terminology - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "For each shipment under this contract, Shipper shall designate the points of origin and destination and any point or points where stopoffs shall be made for partial loading or unloading.  Shipper shall exert its best efforts to load each shipment to the lawful capacity of Carrier's vehicle.",
                "changed_text": "For each transport under this agreement, Shipper shall suggest the points of origin and final location and any point or points where pauses can occur for partial loading or complete offloading.  Shipper shall attempt to load each transport to a reasonable level.",
                "explanation": "Changing key terms: shipment to transport, destination to final location, stopoffs to pauses, unloading to offloading, best efforts to attempt, lawful capacity to reasonable level. These changes create ambiguities. 'Reasonable level' is vague, and removes the adherence to weight regulations. By changing 'shipment' to 'transport' which is undefined creates uncertainty.",

The Professional agrees that, with respect to men's apparel,          he will exclusively endorse and use exclusively in play, practice,           exhibits, clinics and other events open to the media or public, Haley           brand apparel which shall consist of shirts, vests, jackets, sweaters,          pants and shorts (if permitted by applicable rules).",

                "explanation": "The terms \"exclusively endorse\" and \"use exclusively\" are changed to \"generally endorse\" and \"use regularly\". The original text creates an unambiguous obligation. The modification introduces ambiguity, making the obligation less strict and potentially unenforceable. Furthermore, it introduces a contradiction by suggesting that, while the professional should wear mostly Haley brand, this is conditional of the player liking the brand.",

The          Company shall have unlimited rights of utilization of the           Professional's Image in all advertising, promotion, publicity and           other forms of communication with any part during the term of this           Agreement, it being the intent of the Professional that the Company's          utilization of the Professional's Image shall be at the discretion of          the Company.  The right of usage described herein shall be subject to          the requirement that the Company shall not place the Professional's           Image in an unfavorable light.  The Professional or the Professional's          designated agent shall have the right to review any advertising,            promotion or publicity materials utilized by the company which            contain the Professional's Image on reasonable written or oral           request to the Company during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "RIGHTS OF USAGE.  As described in Section 1(b) above, the Professional          has granted the company a non-exclusive right and license          to use his name, autograph, likeness, photographs, electronic media          depiction, signature and any other words, symbols or depiction's          (hereinafter the \"Professional's Image\") which will identify the          Professional to the public in connection with the advertising,           promotion, publicizing, sale and distribution of Haley apparel.

                "explanation": "The term \"exclusive worldwide right\" has been changed to \"non-exclusive right\", severely weakening the company's marketing leverage. The term \"unlimited rights of utilization\" has been reduced, making the Professional's image up for discussion. The company not guaranteeing the Professional's image to not be shown in an unfavorable light, as well as the Professional not having the right to review, adds legal uncertainty. This introduces a conflict regarding the control and usage of the professional's image, potentially leading to disputes over brand representation and endorsement rights.",

In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties          and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties          acknowledge and agree that any such dispute shall be submitted for           binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedures           established by the American arbitration Association in Denver,           Colorado.  If such association is not then in existence, an           independent association of arbitrators may be utilized  which is           designated by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are           unable to agree on an independent association of arbitrators, either           party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment          of arbitrators.",

If there is not an agreement between parties, either party may not apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of arbitrators.",
                "explanation": "Changing \"binding arbitration\" to \"non-binding arbitration\" fundamentally alters the dispute resolution process. Binding arbitration means the arbitrator's decision is final and legally enforceable, while non-binding arbitration serves only as a recommendation. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of any arbitration outcome. Additionally, the removal of court access creates uncertainty about how this would be legally interpreted in instances where arbitration fails or is deemed inappropriate.",

                "original_text": "It is expressly agreed that Endorser is acting as an independent contractor in performing his services hereunder. MusclePharm shall carry no worker's compensation insurance or any health, accident or disability insurance to cover Endorser. MusclePharm shall not pay any contributions to Social Security, unemployment insurance, federal or state withholding taxes, nor provide any other contributions or benefits that might be expected in an employer-employee relationship. Endorser shall be solely responsible and liable for reporting and paying all federal and state income or other taxes applicable to the Endorser's compensation under this Agreement and MusclePharm will provide Lender with an IRS Form 1099 at the end of each calendar year in which compensation is paid to Lender. It is further understood and expressly agreed by Endorser that he has no right or authority to incur expenses, obligations or liabilities in the name of or binding on MusclePharm, and he shall not represent to third parties that he has any relationship (e.g., employer-employee or principal-agent) with MusclePharm other than the independent contractor arrangement set forth in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "It is expressly agreed that Endorser is acting as an independent contractor in performing his services hereunder. MusclePharm shall carry no worker's compensation insurance or any health, accident or disability insurance to cover Endorser. MusclePharm may provide discretionary contributions to Social Security, unemployment insurance, federal or state withholding taxes, and may also provide contributions or benefits that might be expected in an employer-employee relationship, subject to MusclePharm’s sole discretion. Endorser shall be primarily responsible and liable for reporting and paying all federal and state income or other taxes applicable to the Endorser's compensation under this Agreement and MusclePharm will provide Lender with an IRS Form 1099 at the end of each calendar year in which compensation is paid to Lender. It is further understood and expressly agreed by Endorser that he has no right or authority to incur expenses, obligations or liabilities in the name of or binding on MusclePharm, and he shall not represent to third parties that he has any relationship (e.g., employer-employee or principal-agent) with MusclePharm other than the independent contractor arrangement set forth in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modified text introduces contradictory elements to the 'independent contractor' classification. By stating that MusclePharm may provide benefits typically associated with an employer-employee relationship, the contract creates ambiguity and conflicts with the established definition of an independent contractor under IRS guidelines and California labor laws. The term 'primarily responsible' for taxes also introduces uncertainty about who bears the ultimate responsibility, which could lead to legal disputes. The modifications create a legal contradiction.",

                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, \"Net Sales\" shall mean MusclePharm's gross sales (the gross invoice amount billed customers) of the Licensed Products, less discounts and allowances actually shown on the invoice (except cash discounts, transportation costs and commissions not deductible in the calculation of Royalty) and less any bona fide returns (net of all returns actually made or allowed as supported by credit memoranda actually issued to the customers not to exceed 5% in any reporting cycle), the aggregate of which discounts and allowances shall not exceed 5% in any reporting cycle. No other costs incurred in the manufacturing, selling, advertising, and distribution of the Licensed Products shall be deducted nor shall any deduction be allowed for any uncollectible accounts, allowances or bad debt.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, \"Net Sales\" shall mean MusclePharm's gross sales (the gross invoice amount billed customers) of the Licensed Products, less discounts and allowances actually shown on the invoice and less any bona fide returns, the aggregate of which discounts and allowances shall be reasonably determined by MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer. No other costs incurred in the manufacturing, selling, advertising, and distribution of the Licensed Products shall be deducted except as reasonably determined by MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer nor shall any deduction be allowed for any uncollectible accounts, allowances or bad debt except as reasonably determined by MusclePharm’s Chief Financial Officer.",
                "explanation": "This change makes the calculation of \"Net Sales\" subjective and dependent on the discretion of MusclePharm's CFO, contradicting the typical objective accounting standards that define net sales. By removing the specific exclusions and limitations, and replacing them with a standard of 'reasonably determined by MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer,' the definition becomes vague and open to manipulation. This could violate accounting laws and create uncertainty in royalty payments.",

MusclePharm will conduct its activities relating to the marketing of the Licensed Products in a manner it deems fit. In that connection:",
                "explanation": "The phrase 'commercially reasonable efforts' has a specific legal meaning, implying a standard of diligence and prudence. Replacing this with 'what it deems appropriate efforts' and 'in a manner it deems fit' introduces subjectivity and reduces MusclePharm's obligation to a minimal level of effort, creating ambiguity regarding their actual responsibility to promote the products effectively. This could lead to a breach of contract claim, as the standard of performance is no longer objectively defined.",

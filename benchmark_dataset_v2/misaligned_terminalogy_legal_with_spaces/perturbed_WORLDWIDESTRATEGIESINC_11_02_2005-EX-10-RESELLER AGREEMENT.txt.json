                "original_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means any and all trade secrets and other confidential information and know-how related directly or indirectly to TouchStar's business or its products, including inventions, materials, formulae, confidential research, technical information, technology, general know-how, patterns, specifications, systems data, equipment, operating standards and procedures, developments and improvements, computer programs, operating systems, source code, object code, middleware, firmware, information regarding projects, programs and sales, names and addresses of past and present customers, pricing data, internal procedures, systems, methods forms, manuals, financial data, price lists, customer service information, marketing information, and all other information relating to TouchStar, the TouchStar Software, Support Services, or other products or services of TouchStar that is not generally known to the public.",
                "changed_text": "\"Confidential Information\" means specific documents marked as 'Confidential' by TouchStar. This includes only documents explicitly labeled as such and excludes general business practices or customer lists.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is broad and aligns with standard trade secret law. The modified definition is narrow, limiting 'Confidential Information' to only marked documents, which contradicts the broader legal protection afforded to trade secrets under state and federal law (e.g., the Defend Trade Secrets Act). This creates uncertainty as legally recognized trade secrets might not be protected if they are not specifically marked as confidential.",

                "original_text": "Reseller shall report promptly to TouchStar concerning any market information that comes to Reseller's attention regarding TouchStar, the TouchStar Software or the Support Services, including information regarding TouchStar's market position and the competitiveness of the TouchStar Software or the Support Services in the marketplace. Reseller shall report promptly to TouchStar all claimed or suspected defects in the TouchStar Software or Support Services and shall notify TouchStar in writing of any claim or proceeding involving the TouchStar Software or Support Services within five (5) days after Reseller learns of the claim or proceeding.",
                "changed_text": "Reseller may, at its convenience, provide TouchStar with market information if it deems it necessary. The reporting of defects or legal claims is optional and at the sole discretion of the Reseller.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear obligation on the Reseller to report market information, defects, and legal claims promptly. The modified text makes this reporting discretionary. This contradicts the fiduciary duty and implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which require parties to act in the best interest of the agreement and not undermine its purpose. Failure to report critical information could harm TouchStar's business and legal position.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall be governed by the principles of fairness and equity, as determined by the parties, without reference to any specific jurisdiction's laws.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly specifies Colorado law as governing the agreement. The modified clause replaces this with vague 'principles of fairness and equity,' removing a defined legal framework. This creates legal uncertainty as the interpretation and enforcement of the contract are no longer anchored in established legal precedent, contradicting standard contract law principles requiring a defined jurisdiction.",

                "original_text": "“Confidential Information” means trade secrets, knowhow and information (whether or not recorded in documentary form, or stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory) relating to the business, products, affairs and finances of any Group Company or any of their suppliers, customers, agents, shareholders or management, including (but not limited to): (a) business, financial or strategic information or plans; (b) technical data and know-how; (c) litigation, potential litigation or legal advice; (d) employment terms or pay of the Executive or others; (e) commercial terms with business partners; (f) products or services in the course of development; (g) processes or know-how; (h) details of any joint ventures, which (in each case) the Executive creates, develops, learns, receives or obtains in connection with the Executive's employment before or after the date of this agreement, whether or not such information is marked confidential;",
                "changed_text": "“Confidential Information” means any information the Company deems proprietary, regardless of its nature, sensitivity, or whether it constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. This includes, but is not limited to: (a) business, financial or strategic information or plans; (b) technical data and know-how; (c) litigation, potential litigation or legal advice; (d) employment terms or pay of the Executive or others; (e) commercial terms with business partners; (f) products or services in the course of development; (g) processes or know-how; (h) details of any joint ventures, even if such information is publicly available or generally known in the industry.",
                "explanation": "The original definition closely aligns with the legal definition of trade secrets and confidential information. The modified version broadens the definition to include 'any information the Company deems proprietary,' which could encompass information that doesn't legally qualify as confidential information or a trade secret under the UK's Trade Secrets (Enforcement, etc.) Regulations 2018 or common law principles of confidentiality. Including publicly available information directly contradicts the core requirement for information to be secret to be considered confidential.",

Intellectual Property 16.1 The Executive shall disclose to the Company details of all Inventions and of all works embodying Intellectual Property Rights made solely or jointly with others at any time during the term of the employment which relate to, or are capable of being used in, the business of any Group Company whether or not in the course of their ordinary duties and whether or not made in working time (together, the \"Company IP\"). The Executive acknowledges that all Intellectual Property Rights subsisting (or which may in the future subsist) in such Company IP shall automatically, on creation, vest in the Company absolutely.",
                "changed_text": "16. Intellectual Property 16.1 The Executive shall disclose to the Company details of all ideas, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived during the term of employment. All such ideas shall be considered 'Company IP' and shall automatically vest in the Company upon disclosure, regardless of their novelty or originality. To the extent that such ideas do not automatically vest in the Company, the Executive assigns all rights to the Company.",
                "explanation": "By including 'all ideas, whether or not patentable or copyrightable', the modified clause attempts to claim ownership of concepts that may not meet the legal threshold for intellectual property protection. UK law requires inventions to be novel and non-obvious to be patentable, and creative works to be original to be copyrightable. Claiming ownership of non-novel or non-original ideas creates a contradiction with established IP law principles.",

Post Termination Restrictions During the term of employment and indefinitely thereafter, the Executive will not directly or indirectly, either themselves or through others, encourage or solicit any employee, client, or contractor of the Company to terminate their relationship with the Company for any reason, regardless of their performance or conduct.",
                "explanation": "The original clause imposes a one-year restriction on soliciting employees. The modified clause extends this restriction 'indefinitely' and broadens it to include clients and contractors. Indefinite non-solicitation clauses are highly scrutinized under UK law as potentially unreasonable restraints of trade, especially when they restrict contact with clients or contractors where legitimate business interests are not clearly defined and proportionate. The addition of 'regardless of their performance or conduct' further exacerbates the unreasonableness of the restraint.",

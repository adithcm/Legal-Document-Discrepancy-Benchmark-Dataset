                "original_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective of such Party under similar circumstances, it being understood and agreed that with respect to the Development or Commercialization of MGAH22 and Products, such efforts shall be similar to those efforts and resources commonly used by a Party for a similar biological or pharmaceutical product owned by it or to which it has rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account efficacy, safety, approved labeling, the competitiveness of alternative products in the marketplace, the patent and other proprietary position of the product, and the likelihood of regulatory approval given the regulatory structure involved.",
                "changed_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, minimal efforts to accomplish such objective as such Party sees fit, in its sole discretion. It is understood and agreed that with respect to the Development or Commercialization of MGAH22 and Products, such efforts may be less than those efforts and resources commonly used by a Party for a similar biological or pharmaceutical product. The determination of effort is solely at the Party's discretion without consideration of efficacy, safety, approved labeling, the competitiveness of alternative products, or the likelihood of regulatory approval.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' includes specific, objective criteria like 'good faith efforts,' 'similar market potential,' and 'likelihood of regulatory approval.' The modified definition contradicts this by stating 'minimal efforts' at the party's 'sole discretion,' explicitly disregarding the objective criteria. This misalignment creates uncertainty in enforcement because it allows a party to claim compliance while demonstrably underperforming compared to industry standards.",

No deductions shall be made for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to discounts, rebates, returns, taxes, or importing costs. The determination of Net Sales shall be at the sole discretion of Green Cross, based on any accounting method they choose, regardless of consistency.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Sales' provides a detailed list of permissible deductions (discounts, rebates, taxes, etc.) from the gross invoiced amount. The modified definition directly contradicts this by explicitly prohibiting any deductions and granting Green Cross sole discretion over the calculation, effectively nullifying the detailed provisions and potentially leading to underreporting of Net Sales and reduced royalty payments. The term 'consistently applied' was changed as well.",

                "original_text": "Product. Shi Farms agrees to sell Product and Gridiron agrees to purchase 30,000 lbs. of hemp biomass (\"Biomass\") from Shi Farms. Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content. The Biomass must contain no contaminates that are above acceptable industry standards for processing Biomass including but not limited to: Mold and Mildew; Non- Hemp Plant Material; Soil; Insects; Rodent Droppings; Wet or Rotting Material; Heavy Metals; Residual Pesticides or Herbicides; Bacteria.",

Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total TCH content. The Biomass may contain only contaminates that are within Shi Farms' discretion.",
                "explanation": "This modification removes the objective industry standards for acceptable contaminants and replaces them with a subjective standard based on Shi Farms' discretion. This contradicts the implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which requires goods to be fit for their ordinary purpose. This introduces uncertainty because 'Shi Farms' discretion' is vague and unenforceable.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'total cost' to 'total estimated cost', the contract introduces ambiguity regarding the final purchase price. This conflicts with the principle of 'Definiteness' in contract law, which requires a clear and unambiguous agreement on essential terms like price. This modification creates uncertainty in enforcement because the 'estimated' cost might be subject to change, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces the condition of providing written notice. While seemingly innocuous, it impacts the interpretation of 'at any time'. Contract law generally interprets 'at any time' in good faith. Adding 'with written notice' introduces an element of procedural requirement that might be interpreted to override the 'at any time' aspect, thereby creating a conflict. The term, 'written notice' is vague on when it should be provided.",

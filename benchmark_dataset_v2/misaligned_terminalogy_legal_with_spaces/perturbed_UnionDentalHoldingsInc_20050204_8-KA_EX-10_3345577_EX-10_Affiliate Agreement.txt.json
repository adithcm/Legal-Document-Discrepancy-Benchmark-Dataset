                "changed_text": "Confidential Information shall mean any information that one Party shares, regardless of whether it is meant to be private or whether it is shielded by the law.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' aligns with standard legal interpretations, emphasizing reasonable expectation of privacy and legal protection. The modified definition broadens the scope to include any shared information, contradicting established privacy laws and creating uncertainty about what information is truly protected.",

                "original_text": "It is expressly  understood and agreed\nthat (i) in the performance of Services under this Agreement,  the Business\nAffiliate shall at all times act as an independent  contractor with respect\nto UDC and not as an employee or agent of UDC and (ii) nothing contained in\nthis Agreement  shall be construed to create a joint venture,  partnership,\nassociation  or  other  affiliation,  or  like  relationship,  between  the\nParties,  it being  specifically  agreed that the relationship is and shall\nremain  that  of  independent   Parties  to  a  contractual   relationship.\nAccordingly,  UDC shall  neither have nor exercise any specific  control or\ndirection over the particular  methods by which Business Affiliate performs\nservices  required by this  Agreement.  In no event shall  either  Party be\nliable  for the debts or  obligations  of the  other,  except as  otherwise\nspecifically provided in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) in the performance of Services under this Agreement, the Business Affiliate shall act as a service provider. UDC retains the right to direct and control the methods by which Business Affiliate performs services required by this Agreement. UDC will be liable for the obligations of the affiliate within the scope of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text explicitly defines the Business Affiliate as an 'independent contractor', with UDC having no control over the methods of service performance, aligning with independent contractor law. The modification contradicts this by stating that UDC retains control, implying an employer-employee relationship. Additionally, the changed text introduces potential liability for UDC, further blurring the lines between an independent contractor and an employee or agent.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that all employees, agents and representatives must be informed of and legally bound to comply with the agreement. The modified text removes the obligation to inform all relevant parties and weakens the compliance requirement, undermining the enforceability of the agreement and creating conflict with basic agency law principles.",

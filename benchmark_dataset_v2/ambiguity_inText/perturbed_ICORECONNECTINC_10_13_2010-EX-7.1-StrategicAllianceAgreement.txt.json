The suggested monthly subscription would be $19.95 per month per subscriber. USA MCO would receive one third of the monthly subscription price, per month, per subscriber (approximately $6.65).

Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least sixty 90 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",

Thereafter, this Agreement shall be renewed automatically on a five (5) year basis, unless one party notifies the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at least 120 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or then current renewal term, as applicable, or unless a new Agreement is signed between the USA MCO and IMedicor which will then invalidate this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original termination notice period is both 'sixty' and '90' days, which conflicts with each other. Modified text changes the conflicting 'sixty 90' days to 120 days. This creates a conflict since the contract is implying that it can be terminated at 60 or 90 days as written with both values. Changing it to 120 creates a conflict as there will be a dispute on the term as 'sixty 90'.",

                "explanation": "Section 3 specifies a potential termination notice of 'sixty 90' days while Section 5.A now states '30' days. This contradiction creates confusion around the required notice period for termination without cause. The notice period will cause legal dispute.",

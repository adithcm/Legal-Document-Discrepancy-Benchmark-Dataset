This creates a contradiction because later clauses referring to 'Distribution' could be interpreted differently depending on which definition is used, affecting obligations related to ongoing unit transfers.",

The                            Prospectus does not contain any  misrepresentation or                            any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omit any                            statement  or  information,  the  omission  of  which                            constitutes a misrepresentation, or omit to state any                            material  fact  required to be stated or necessary to                            make any  statement  contained  therein  not false or                            misleading in light of the  circumstances in which it                            is made and all information and statements  contained                            in the Prospectus are true and correct.  In addition,                            all  information  and  statements  contained  in  the                            Prospectus constitute full, true and plain disclosure                            of all material facts.",

The Issuer represents that, to the best of its current knowledge, all information and statements contained in the Prospectus are accurate.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty is an absolute statement that the Prospectus complies with the Securities Law and contains no misrepresentations. The modified version weakens this warranty by stating that the Issuer 'believes' it complies and only guarantees accuracy 'to the best of its current knowledge.' This creates a conflict because the original warranty implies strict liability for any misstatement, while the modified version suggests a due diligence standard, potentially reducing the Issuer's liability.",

This indemnification specifically excludes any liability arising from any statement or omission in the Prospectus, or otherwise made or omitted by the Issuer in connection with the Offering.\n\n",
                "explanation": "The original section provides broad indemnification to the Indemnified Parties for any liability arising from misstatements in the Prospectus. The modified section limits indemnification to cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Issuer, and explicitly excludes liability arising from statements or omissions in the Prospectus. This is a direct contradiction, as the original clause covers Prospectus misstatements without qualification, while the modified clause excludes them from coverage. It creates uncertainty about the Sponsorâ€™s protection against Prospectus-related liabilities.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the authority of each Joint Venturer. Originally, either could execute instruments but needed consent for incurring debt, disposing of assets, or purchasing items. The modified version grants either joint venturer full authority to make these decisions, contradicting the previous restrictions and creating uncertainty about financial control.",

                "explanation": "This edit creates a contradiction about the renewal of the joint venture agreement. The original text requires mutual written agreement for extension, but the modified text allows either venturer unilaterally extend for one year. This creates uncertainty regarding whether both parties' agreement is actually needed and the maximum validity period of the extension.",

On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.",
                "changed_text": "11.  Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner deemed reasonable by a third-party mediator, regardless of the satisfaction of the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture, but all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed based on the discretion of the third-party mediator, irrespective of the parties' prorata interests. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the third-party mediator shall determine the fair price and decide which party receives the asset, potentially offsetting balances to ensure fair distribution, as determined by the mediator.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates that debt payment satisfaction upon termination and asset distribution follow the Joint Venturers' prorata ownership. The modification introduces a third-party mediator who has ultimate decision-making power on these matters, overriding the parties' initial agreement. This clearly introduces a contradiction about debt payment satisfaction and asset distribution responsibilities, creating uncertainty regarding whether the Joint Venturers' agreement is actually needed.",

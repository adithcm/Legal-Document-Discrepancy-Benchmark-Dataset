                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the agreement's duration. Initially, it lasts until revoked. Now, it's for five years unless revoked. This creates uncertainty about its lifespan, potentially leading to disputes after five years if no revocation has occurred.",

                "original_text": "Pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, each party hereto hereby agrees to the joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of any filing required by such party under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder (including any amendment, restatement, supplement, and/or exhibit thereto) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, if such security is registered on a national securities exchange, also with the exchange), and further agrees to the filing, furnishing, and/or incorporation by reference of this agreement as an exhibit thereto.",
                "changed_text": "Pursuant to and generally consistent with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), each party hereto agrees to consider joint filing, on behalf of each of them, of filings under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, where deemed necessary by a majority vote of the parties. The decision to file jointly under Section 16 will be at the sole discretion of each individual party, and this agreement is not binding regarding Section 16 filings.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces a significant contradiction regarding the obligation to file jointly. The original text states that each party agrees to joint filing under both Section 13 and 16. The modified text weakens the obligation for Section 13 (changing \"in accordance with\" to \"generally consistent with\" and \"agrees to the joint filing\" to \"agrees to consider joint filing\"), introduces a majority vote requirement, and completely removes the obligation for Section 16 filings, making it discretionary. This could lead to disputes over whether joint filings are mandatory or optional, and who bears the responsibility for individual filings under Section 16.",

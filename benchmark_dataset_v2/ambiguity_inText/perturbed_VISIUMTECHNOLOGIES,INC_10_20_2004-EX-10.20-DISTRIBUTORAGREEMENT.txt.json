WLI hereby grants to Power2Ship the non-exclusive right and license to distribute certain WLI's products and services (the \"Products\" or \"Units\") and software programs (\"Licensed Programs\") to Power2Ship's customers (which are end users) located in North America. \"Products\" or \"Units\" in this Agreement are limited to WLI's G3001 GPSLink mobile terminal as defined in Section 1.2. \"Licensed Programs\" in this Agreement are limited to WLI's MidLink Middleware software and G3001 programming tools. Further, Power2Ship shall also be authorized to resell other WLI products, services and support programs subject to separate written amendments to be made by the parties to this Agreement. WLI reserves the right to add additional products and to delete obsolete or superseded products at any time during the term of this Agreement upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Power2Ship.",

Power2Ship will receive the first customer call and will have to maintain a minimum inventory level of spare Units to service its customers within 48 hours. WLI will support an end-user directly, without requiring Power2Ship intervention, if the end-user purchased an extended support plan directly from WLI. WLI will not be involved in any end-user training.",
                "explanation": "This modification creates a contradiction by stating in one clause Power2Ship should be the first line of support, but then immediately following, allowing WLI to support the end user directly without P2S involvment. This creates ambiguity on who is responsible for initial support.",

For purposes of the preceding sentence, King's commercially reasonable efforts shall mean, until [***], at least the same degree of effort (including with respect to the reach and frequency of Details) that King would use for the Promotion of any of King's products that are promoted in the [***], are of a similar market size and patent life, and represent a similar commercial opportunity; thereafter, King will apply the same standard, except that it may fulfill its obligations by Promoting the Product in the [***].

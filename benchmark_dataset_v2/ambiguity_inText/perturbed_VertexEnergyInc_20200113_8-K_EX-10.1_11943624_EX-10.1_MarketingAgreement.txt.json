                "changed_text": "“Area” means exclusively Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. No adjacent areas are included.",
                "explanation": "The original definition allows for adjacent areas to be included in the 'Area' if mutually agreed upon. The modified definition removes this possibility, creating a direct contradiction and ambiguity regarding the scope of the agreement's geographical reach.",

                "changed_text": "4.1. Payment by Bunker One for the Product, as defined in clause 2.1, will be made by wire transfer within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the month in which Vertex invoices Bunker One, to an account designated from time to time by Vertex.",
                "explanation": "This creates an inconsistency regarding the payment deadline. The original text stipulates payment within three business days of the invoice date. The modified text states payment is due within fifteen business days after the end of the month in which the invoice was issued. This is a contradiction with the original text and could cause disputes as to when payment is actually due.",

                "changed_text": "16. Notices. 16.1. All notices and other communications given under the JSMA shall be delivered exclusively via certified mail and shall only be deemed effective five (5) business days after the date of mailing, regardless of when actually received.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allows for various methods of written communication, including fax and email, with effectiveness upon receipt. The changed clause mandates certified mail as the *only* acceptable method and delays effectiveness until five business days after mailing. This directly contradicts the original text, potentially causing disputes over the validity and timeliness of notices.",

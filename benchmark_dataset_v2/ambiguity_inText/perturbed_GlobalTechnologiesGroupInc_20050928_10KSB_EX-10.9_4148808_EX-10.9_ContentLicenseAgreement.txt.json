Subscription fee in Territory is to be determined based on market research performed by Distributor with pricing to be agreed upon jointly and in writing Each quarter, Distributor will make royalty payments to IMNTV based on a Structure as follows:\n\n55% of subscriber revenue for the subscription based services broadcasting IMNTV content only, net of telecom percentage provided in accordance with this Agreement.   (\"Programming Payments\"), subject to the following: The parties acknowledge that some mobile carriers may bill end users for a full month in a single billing, and that others may bill for partial months or pro-rate the billing of Recurring Subscribers. For each full month of Fees received from a Recurring Subscriber, Distributor will pay IMNTV based on the Rate Structure (the \"Full Month Payment\").

Distributor will make royalty payments to IMNTV based on a structure as follows: A fixed fee of $0.01 per subscriber per month, regardless of actual subscriber revenue, is owed to IMNTV. Telecom percentages are to be borne solely by IMNTV. Distributor is not responsible for fees received from Recurring Subscribers, but must pay based on raw subscriber numbers.",

The changed clause gives Distributor full control of pricing and changes the payment structure to a fixed fee of $0.01 per subscriber, with IMNTV bearing telecom percentages. This drastically alters the financial obligations and creates a direct conflict regarding revenue sharing and pricing control.",

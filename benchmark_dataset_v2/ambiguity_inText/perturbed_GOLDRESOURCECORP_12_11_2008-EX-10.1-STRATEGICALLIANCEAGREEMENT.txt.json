In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n\n\n  (d) \"Affiliate\" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Securities Act;\n\n  (v) \"HOC Entities\" means HOC and its Affiliates, and any person acting jointly or in concert with any of them, excluding, for greater certainty, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the extent they may be or become Affiliates at any relevant point in time;",

In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:\n\n\n\n  (d) \"Affiliate\" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Securities Act; for the purpose of Article 5 Board Representation, Affiliate shall mean any entity directly or indirectly controlled by HOC, irrespective of the definition in the Securities Act;\n\n  (v) \"HOC Entities\" means HOC and its Affiliates, and any person acting jointly or in concert with any of them, excluding, for greater certainty, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the extent they may be or become Affiliates at any relevant point in time;",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is modified to include a specific condition within Article 5. This creates a contradiction because, for all other sections, the standard Securities Act definition applies, but for board representation, the definition broadens. This could cause disputes over which entities HOC can use to meet requirements in article 5.",

If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC shall be entitled to nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the \"HOC Director\"). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.",

                "explanation": "The term 'shall nominate' has been changed to 'may nominate'. This introduces a contradiction because in the rest of the agreement HOC is granted certain rights that are clear and mandatory. This subtle modification makes HOC's right to nominate a director discretionary, whereas the original text suggests it is an obligation, introducing uncertainty in the Board Representation.",

                "explanation": "The applicable law section now has a conflict because the contract specifies New York law, but also states that mining rights are governed by the laws of Oaxaca, Mexico. This creates a potential dispute over which law applies in cases where the interpretation of the agreement depends on an understanding of mining rights, particularly given the properties are located in Oaxaca.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'shall pay' to 'may pay' introduces uncertainty regarding the obligation of Service Recipient to pay. Simultaneously, changing 'may agree to waive' to 'will waive' makes it mandatory for the service provider to waive fees in case of losses. This creates conflicting interpretations.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates arbitration through BAC, making the arbitral award final. The modified text suggests litigation in a court of law with possibility of appeals. This contradiction on method of dispute resolution (Arbitration vs. Litigation) causes ambiguity.",

By changing it to 'may be renewed upon mutual agreement,' the renewal becomes discretionary and dependent on a new agreement, contradicting the initially stated automatic renewal process.",

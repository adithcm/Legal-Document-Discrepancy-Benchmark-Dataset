The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as follows: for screening Clinical Studies: $***, for long term follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term. In the event a Study is terminated early, then in relation to any funds allocated to such Study, the Parties shall promptly discuss and agree upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is approved by the JSC, and that will be funded by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be allocated to studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests.",

The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as follows: for screening Clinical Studies: $***, for long term follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall have no obligation to negotiate the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term, and Adaptimmune can opt out without any obligations or legal ramifications. In the event a Study is terminated early, Adaptimmune has the sole discretion to allocate fund for replacement studies. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Adaptimmune solely will decide whether to allocate to the studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by contradicting itself about the financial commitments. In original text, Adaptimmune agrees with a fixed amount. However, in the modified text, it changed on future study funding where Adaptimmune can opt out. In another sentence, Adaptimmune will solely decide whether to allocate Alliance Funding for future cases.",

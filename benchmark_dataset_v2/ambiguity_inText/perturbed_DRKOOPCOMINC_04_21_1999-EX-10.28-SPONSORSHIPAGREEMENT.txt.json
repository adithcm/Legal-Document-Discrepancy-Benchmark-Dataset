Such User Data is owned by each Individual User and drkoop.com does not use or disclose any such User Data without the consent of the Individual User.",

For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means non-public information about the disclosing party's business or activities that is proprietary and confidential, which shall include, without limitation, all business, financial, technical and other information of a party marked or designated \"confidential\" or by its nature or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure should reasonably be regarded as confidential. Confidential Information includes not only written or other tangible information, but also information transferred orally, visually, electronically or by any other means. Confidential Information will not include information that (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement, (ii) the receiving party lawfully receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of a nondisclosure obligation or (iii) the receiving party knew prior to receiving such information from the disclosing party or develops independently.",
                "changed_text": "5.1.  CONFIDENTIALITY. For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means any information exchanged between the parties. This definition is absolute and includes all business, financial, technical and other information, regardless of whether it is marked \"confidential\" or should reasonably be regarded as such. Confidential Information includes all forms of information transfer. Confidential Information will include information that (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement, (ii) the receiving party lawfully receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of a nondisclosure obligation or (iii) the receiving party knew prior to receiving such information from the disclosing party or develops independently.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Confidential Information' is nuanced, excluding information already in the public domain or independently developed. The modified version broadens the definition to include 'any information exchanged', making it an absolute definition and potentially conflicting with the listed exclusions, especially concerning information that enters the public domain without breach.",

                "changed_text": "8.4.  TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice of any breach by the other party. The breaching party will have thirty (30) days to cure the breach, but the termination is effective immediately upon notice regardless of the cure period.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding when termination is effective. The original text allows for termination only after 30 days if the breach isn't cured. The modified text allows for immediate termination, even though a 30-day cure period is mentioned, making the actual termination timeline ambiguous and creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

Approved Account\n\nFor purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate's Website; (ii) is approved by Chase; and (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",
                "changed_text": "4. Approved Account\n\nFor purposes of determining Affiliate's Commission, an \"Approved Account\" means any Chase credit card application that is: (i) submitted by any user who clicks on an e-mail, banner or any other advertising material from Affiliate's Website; (ii) is approved by Chase based on their internal scoring criteria; and (iii) results in the issuance of a physical credit card to the applicant.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Approved Account' relies on Chase's reporting of approval to the affiliate. The modified version introduces a stricter definition by requiring the issuance of a physical card. This contradiction could lead to disputes if an application is 'approved' but no card is ever issued, leaving it unclear whether the affiliate is entitled to a commission. The other section says that 'Approved Account' is when (iii) is reported as approved by Chase to Affiliate.",

Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination. At the time of termination, any links to Chase's Website must be removed immediately.

Either Affiliate or Chase may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written or e-mail notice of termination, which will be effective 30 days after receipt. At the time of termination, any links to Chase's Website must be removed within a commercially reasonable timeframe. Affiliate will continue to receive Commission payments for all Approved Accounts placed during the term of this Agreement and for 90 days following termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chase may terminate this Agreement immediately if Affiliate does not comply with the terms and conditions herein.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the agreement ends when terminated by either party, with immediate removal of links. The modified text introduces a 30-day delay for termination effectiveness, a 'commercially reasonable timeframe' for link removal, and extends commission payments for 90 days post-termination. This contradicts the original immediacy, creating uncertainty about termination obligations and commission eligibility. This internal contradiction would create problems.",

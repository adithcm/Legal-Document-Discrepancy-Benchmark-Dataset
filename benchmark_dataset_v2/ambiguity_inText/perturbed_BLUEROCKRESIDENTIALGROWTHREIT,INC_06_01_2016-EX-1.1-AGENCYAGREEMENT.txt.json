Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it became effective under the Act, including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein and any information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, shall be referred to as the \"Registration Statement.\"",

For the purposes of *Section 1, only*, Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, in the form in which it became effective under the Act, including all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein and any information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, shall be referred to as the \"Registration Statement.\"",
                "explanation": "This change restricts the scope of the 'Registration Statement' definition to Section 1 only. This contradicts the implicit understanding that the term applies to the entire document, potentially creating uncertainty about which definition to apply in other sections.",

                "explanation": "The initial definition says the fee is 3.15%. The added text in the Section introduces another potential fee (4%) if a transaction is consummated after a specific date. This creates uncertainty as to which fee applies, particularly in transactions that start before and conclude after the specified date, or if the contract extends beyond that date, leading to conflict.",

                "explanation": "The modification introduces a conflict regarding the use of proceeds. Originally, the proceeds had to be used as described in the specified sections of the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package, and Prospectus. The addition allows for a discretionary allocation of up to 10% for general administrative expenses, irrespective of those prior mentioned documents. This contradicts the initial commitment and creates uncertainty about how the net proceeds will be used, potentially violating investor expectations and leading to legal challenges over transparency.",

No offers or sales of the Offered Shares shall be made to any person without the prior approval of such person by the Company, such approval to be at the reasonable discretion of the Company.",

No offers or sales of the Offered Shares shall be made to any person without the prior approval of such person by the Company, such approval to be at the absolute discretion of the Company.",
                "explanation": "Changing 'commercially reasonable efforts' to 'best efforts' imposes a higher standard of performance on the Agent, while altering 'reasonable discretion' to 'absolute discretion' gives the Company unrestricted control over approving potential buyers. This creates a conflict, as the Agent must now exert maximum effort to fulfill sales, but the Company's unfettered approval power can hinder these efforts, leading to potential disputes over performance expectations.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'all expenses' to 'all reasonable expenses', 'all the costs and expenses' to 'all the necessary costs and expenses', 'Agent designate' to 'Agent reasonably designate', increasing the maximum legal counsel cost from '$35,000' to '$50,000', 'all actually and reasonably incurred costs and expenses' to 'all actually incurred costs and expenses' and by changing 'no obligation to pay any costs and expenses' to 'no obligation to pay any excessive costs and expenses', it creates ambiguity. The term 'reasonable', 'necessary' and 'excessive' lacks clarity, leading to disputes over which expenses are legitimately covered. An external auditor may have a different determination on what is 'necessary' and 'reasonable', while entities may have different definitions as well. This contradiction affects the financial obligations of the transaction entities and could lead to financial disputes.",

                "original_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby confirm the agreement by and among them to the joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and any and all further amendments thereto, with respect to the securities of the above referenced issuer, and that this Agreement be included as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "changed_text": "In accordance with Rule 13d-1(k) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the undersigned hereby indicate their intention to consider a joint filing on behalf of them of the Statement on Schedule 13D and subsequent amendments, regarding the securities of the referenced issuer, and that this Agreement might be attached as an Exhibit to such filing.",
                "explanation": "The original text confirms an agreement to jointly file, while the modified text only indicates an intention to consider a joint filing. This creates ambiguity as to whether a binding agreement exists from the outset. 'Confirm the agreement' implies a legally binding commitment, whereas 'indicate their intention to consider' suggests a preliminary, non-binding stage. The 'might be attached' also removes the certainty that the Agreement will be included as an exhibit.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, however, for enforceability, all counterparts must be identical and fully executed by all parties; an incomplete execution may render that counterpart invalid, but will not affect any original signed agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original states all counterparts are original. The modified text introduces conditions for validity, making execution uncertain unless identical and fully executed by all parties. This creates a contradiction, because it introduces conditions where non-identical counterparts (which would be valid in the original), may render enforceability uncertain. The original intent is that each counterpart is fully valid, while the modified intent adds conditional execution which weakens that.",

                "changed_text": "The parties agree to consider filing jointly, with final determination contingent upon ongoing due diligence review of all relevant information and continued consultation of the parties on financial and regulatory matters.",
                "explanation": "The first section indicates the agreement to jointly file. Here, the agreement is based upon ongoing due diligence and consultation. This creates ambiguity and removes enforceability, because it's unclear if the parties are required to file jointly, and could be based on factors outside the agreement's control.",

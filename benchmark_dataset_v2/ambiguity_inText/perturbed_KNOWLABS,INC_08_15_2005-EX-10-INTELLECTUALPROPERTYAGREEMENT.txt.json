                "original_text": "In this Agreement, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings: (a) \"Affiliate\" shall have the same meaning as contained in the Canada Business Corporations Act; \"Company Affiliate\" shall mean any Affiliate of the Company",
                "changed_text": "In this Agreement, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings: (a) \"Affiliate\" shall mean any entity controlled by the Company; \"Company Affiliate\" shall mean any Affiliate of the Company",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' refers to the Canada Business Corporations Act, providing a specific legal standard. The modified definition introduces ambiguity by stating 'any entity controlled by the Company,' which is subjective and lacks a precise legal definition. This could lead to disputes over which entities qualify as affiliates, impacting the scope of the agreement's provisions concerning company affiliates.",

Upon the termination of Turpin's employment with the Company, Turpin may retain copies of Work Product deemed necessary for personal use.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the return of all Work Product and Company Property. The modified version weakens this obligation by requiring only 'reasonable efforts' for return upon request and allows Turpin to retain copies of Work Product after termination for personal use. This directly contradicts the earlier assignment of all rights in the Work Product to the Company, creating uncertainty about ownership and usage rights after termination.",

Termination under this Section 12 shall be effective from the date written notice is delivered or the date specified in the written notice. whichever is later.",
                "changed_text": "This Agreement may, with written notice, be terminated by either party should Turpin's employment with the Company terminate for any reason. However, if the termination is due to Turpin's gross negligence, the agreement will automatically be extended for a period of one year from the date of termination. Termination under this Section 12 shall be effective from the date written notice is delivered or the date specified in the written notice. whichever is later.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows termination of the agreement upon termination of employment. The modified version introduces an exception where termination due to 'gross negligence' automatically extends the agreement. This creates ambiguity because 'gross negligence' is not clearly defined, and the extension clause contradicts the general right to terminate upon employment termination.",

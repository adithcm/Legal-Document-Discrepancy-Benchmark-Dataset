For the purpose of sections 2 and 3 only, an affiliate also includes any entity where the Company holds more than 20% equity;\n\n     (b)  \"Company Property\" means only tangible equipment such as computers, monitors, and cell phones provided to or used by Turpin.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Affiliate' adds a condition regarding equity holding, creating a conflict with the original definition for sections 2 and 3. This could lead to disputes regarding ownership of intellectual property if an entity qualifies as an affiliate under the new definition but not the original. The Company Property definition is also narrowed, creating ambiguity on what needs to be returned to the company",

For the purposes of Section 6, Work Product refers only to items directly related to ongoing Research and Development projects approved in writing by the Company's CEO.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of Work Product introduces a restriction for Section 6 (Return of Company Property), limiting it to items directly related to approved R&D projects. This contradicts the broader original definition, creating uncertainty about what Turpin must return upon termination of employment. This could allow Turpin to retain certain work if it doesn't meet the new criteria.",

The modified version adds the condition of written acknowledgement from the other party, creating a contradiction. This could lead to disputes over whether a termination is valid if the other party doesn't acknowledge it, even if proper notice was given.",

In consideration to the Agent for performance of its duties and obligations hereunder, the Agent shall be entitled to a Commission (\"Commission\"). Such Commission shall represent a percentage of the Program EBIT realized by the Roundup L&G Business which percentage shall be (i) for Program Years 2017 and 2018, 50% of the Program EBIT and (ii) for Program Years 2019 and thereafter, 50% of the Program EBIT in excess of $40MM (such $40MM threshold, the \"Commission Threshold\"). The parties agree that the Commission Threshold may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties following the inclusion or exclusion of either new or existing countries in the Included Markets, including Activated Included Markets, or Excluded Markets, as applicable.\n\n(b) Payment of Commission. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. If so, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).\n\n(c) Final Determination. Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each Program Year, the Agent shall deliver to Monsanto a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission due at the expiry of the Program Year and shall set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the preceding Program Year. If within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does not provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the amount of the Commission for such Program Year shall be as provided thereon. If within such fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by removing the deductions for product returns, credits, trade allowances, Cost of Goods Sold and 365 Distribution Costs in the definition of '365 Gross Profits'. This creates uncertainty in calculating the actual profits, leading to disputes.",

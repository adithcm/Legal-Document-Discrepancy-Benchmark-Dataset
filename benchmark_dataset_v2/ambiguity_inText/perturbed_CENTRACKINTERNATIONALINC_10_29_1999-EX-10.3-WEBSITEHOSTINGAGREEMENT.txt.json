                "original_text": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use best efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends.",
                "changed_text": "i-on will endeavor to maintain the operation of the Hosted Site, but makes no guarantee of continuous, twenty-four (24) hour per day, seven (7) days per week availability, especially during holidays. i-on will attempt to schedule maintenance between 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends, but reserves the right to perform maintenance at any time.",
                "explanation": "This changes the service level from a commitment to continuous operation to a more ambiguous 'endeavor'. It also removes the scheduled maintenance window, allowing maintenance at any time, which contradicts the initial statement of best efforts to perform maintenance during specific hours.",

                "original_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer is expected to pay i-on a monthly fee, currently set at $450. While the customer is encouraged to pay by the 5th of each month, beginning April 1, 1999, late payments will be addressed on a case-by-case basis and may not necessarily result in immediate interruption or discontinuation of services.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the payment terms from a strict obligation with a clear consequence for late payment (interruption/discontinuation of service) to a more flexible arrangement where the consequences of late payment are uncertain. The use of 'expected' and 'encouraged' weakens the Customer's obligation, creating an ambiguity.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement may be renewed for subsequent periods. While either the Customer or i-on can provide notice of non-renewal, the exact timeframe for such notice will be subject to mutual agreement between both parties closer to the end of the then-current term. Efforts will be made to provide at least fifteen (15) days notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the renewal terms. It replaces the automatic renewal with a 'may be renewed' statement and replaces the definite 15-day notice period with a requirement for 'mutual agreement' and stating 'efforts will be made' to provide 15 days notice, making the renewal process uncertain.",

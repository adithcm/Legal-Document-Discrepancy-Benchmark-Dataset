                "changed_text": "i-on will maintain the operation of the Hosted Site continuously, twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, including holidays, with the exception of reasonable hardware and software maintenance that must be performed on the Hosting Computer and/or the Hosted Site. i-on will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule and perform such maintenance between the hours of 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, or during weekends. However, i-on reserves the right to perform maintenance at any time without prior notice if deemed necessary for system stability.",
                "explanation": "The original text commits to continuous operation, then outlines specific maintenance windows. The modified text introduces a clause allowing maintenance at any time without notice 'if deemed necessary for system stability'. This creates a contradiction, as continuous operation is no longer guaranteed, and the scheduled maintenance window is undermined. This is ambiguous because the customer has the expectation that i-on will maintain the site 24/7, unless the maintenance happens during 8pm and 8am Eastern Standard Time, but the added sentence causes ambiguity. It is no longer clear when can a maintenance be performed.",

The Customer is responsible for paying the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. The Customer acknowledges that failure to pay such fees in a timely manner will result in the interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site.",
                "changed_text": "The Customer is responsible for paying i-on the recurring monthly fee in the amount of $450. The Customer is encouraged to pay the recurring monthly fees by the 5th day of each month beginning in April 1, 1999. While prompt payment is appreciated, a grace period of 10 days will be allowed before any interruption or discontinuation of services for the Hosted Site is implemented.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the customer 'is responsible' for paying by the 5th, with discontinuation of service as a consequence. The modified text introduces 'encouraged' and a 'grace period,' contradicting the mandatory nature of the original payment terms. This creates ambiguity about when payment is actually due and what the repercussions of late payment truly are. The original states a strict cut off date, but now it has flexibility.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.",

Any prepaid fees for services not yet rendered will be refunded.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states that termination does not relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due. The modified text states the Customer only pays for services rendered up to termination, with a refund for prepaid services not yet rendered. This is a direct contradiction regarding payment obligations upon termination. It creates ambiguity regarding how much the customer needs to pay if the service has been terminated. Also ambiguity on if the customer will be refunded or not.",

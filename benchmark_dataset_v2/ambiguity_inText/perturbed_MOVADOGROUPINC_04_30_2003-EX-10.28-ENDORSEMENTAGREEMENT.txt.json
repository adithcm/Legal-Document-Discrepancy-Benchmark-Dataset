In\nthe event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.",

However, the company may elect not to pay the premiums if it determines the policy is no longer a valuable investment, providing notice to the Trust 30 days prior to the premium due date. In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the Company's obligation to pay premiums. Initially, it 'agrees to pay premiums.' Now, it can 'elect not to pay' under certain conditions, which may contradict the 'terms of this Agreement' mentioned at the beginning of the section. This contradiction creates uncertainty.",

If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall not be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Company Default\" shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Policy if the Company fails to pay a premium on the Policy as required under the terms of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after the due date for such premium, or if the Company processes or attempts to process a policy loan, or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust. The Company shall notify the Trustees of the Trust within five (5) business days of any event which constitutes a Company Default.",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that if the company defaults the Trust can force the company to transfer the policy. The changed text creates a conflicting resolution. The new text replaces the definite action of requiring the company to transfer the policy with a non-binding meeting, weakening the Trust's recourse and creating a conflict regarding how default is handled. It is no longer a guarantee the Trust can get the policy in a company default.",

The changed text indicates that The Company may amend or modify this Agreement at any time, even if such amendment or modification would adversely affect the rights of the Trust under this Agreement.

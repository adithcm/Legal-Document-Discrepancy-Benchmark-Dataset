These services can either be carried out directly by EIT or by subcontracts in the sole discretion of EIT, which will have to notify the customer of this fact before the project commence. However if EIT decides to subcontract the project EIT remains responsible for the quality, the cost and the supervision of the services to the satisfaction of the customer.",

These services can either be carried out directly by EIT or by subcontracts at the discretion of EIT, without needing to notify the customer. If EIT subcontracts the project, EIT is responsible for the cost, but the quality and supervision are the subcontractor's responsibility, provided they are a reputable firm.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict regarding subcontracting. The original text states EIT must notify the customer before subcontracting and remains responsible for the quality and supervision even if subcontracted. The modified text removes the notification requirement and shifts responsibility for quality and supervision to the subcontractor if they are a reputable firm. This creates uncertainty about who is ultimately accountable for project outcomes.",

EIT guarantees that the solution suggested to the Customer in each moment is the best possible one for the needs of theCustomer.\n\n  9.2. Cost Saving\n\n  9.2.1. EIT declares that the way of acting will always be governed by the cost saving principle.\n\n  9.3. Technology\n\n  9.3.1. EIT commits to maintain its IT environment in accordance to the technological advances, in order to prevent it frombecoming obsolete.\n\n  9.4. Quality Control\n\n  9.4.1. EIT guarantees that the services described in this Agreement will be rendered in accordance with the best practice, aquality level accepted by the Customer, and in accordance with the service levels defined in Annex 2.",
                "changed_text": "9. WARRANTY\n\n  9.1. Solution's Adequacy\n\n  9.1.1. EIT will strive to suggest solutions that are suitable for the Customer's needs, but makes no guarantee as to the optimality of those solutions.\n\n  9.2. Cost Saving\n\n  9.2.1. EIT declares that it will attempt to minimize costs where feasible.\n\n  9.3. Technology\n\n  9.3.1. EIT will make reasonable efforts to maintain its IT environment in line with technological advances.\n\n  9.4. Quality Control\n\n  9.4.1. EIT aims to render services described in this Agreement in accordance with common practices and at a quality level generally acceptable, but conformance to Annex 2 cannot be assured.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces guarantees and commitments with weaker statements of intent. The original text provides guarantees about solution adequacy, quality, and technology. The modified text uses softer language like 'strive,' 'attempt,' 'reasonable efforts,' and removes assurance regarding Annex 2 service levels. This creates a contradiction, as the first statement suggests there is no guarantee, where others might assume it implies a high level of assurance. This undermines the enforceability of the original warranty clauses.",

The Agreement rests, for all that, cancellable at any time by any of the parties before the expiry date of the Agreement or any of itsrenewals, upon three months prior written notice.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a direct contradiction regarding the cancellation of the agreement. The original text states the agreement is cancellable at any time with three months' notice. The modified text states it is non-cancellable except under specific conditions in Section 14. This introduces confusion about the circumstances under which either party can terminate the agreement and creates grounds for disputes.",

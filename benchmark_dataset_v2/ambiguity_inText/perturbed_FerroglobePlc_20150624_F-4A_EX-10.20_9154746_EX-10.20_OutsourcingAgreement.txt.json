NETWORK EIT is in charge of the remote Network, which connects each workstation of the Customer to the Central Server of EIT and to Internet (hereinafter \"WAN\").

The internal network of the factories (hereinafter \"LAN\") is managed jointly by EIT and the Customer.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states EIT is 'in charge' of the WAN and the Customer is solely responsible for the LAN. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating EIT 'assists' with the WAN and that the LAN is 'managed jointly.' This creates a contradiction and uncertainty regarding the extent of EIT's responsibility for the WAN and the Customer's for the LAN.",

The modified text contradicts this by giving the Customer the final decision on equipment and making them responsible for the maintenance of EIT's IT environment, creating uncertainty and shifting financial burdens.",

                "explanation": "The original defines Value Added Distributor Price List as a *portion* of the Global Price List. The modified version defines it as a 'completely separate list', creating conflicting definitions of the relationship between the two price lists. It becomes unclear which products from the Global Price List are sold on the Value Added Distributor Price List or if they are completely different lists.",

                "explanation": "Section 10.1 originally states distributor *shall* pass the warranties while the modification of 10.1 indicates the distributor *may at their option, decide to extend the warranties*. Further Section 10.2 indicates the warranty to distributor applies 'indefinitely', opposing the idea that the warranty statement is *limited*. Lastly, section 10.3 originally indicates the distributor *shall not make any warranty commitment* while the modification indicates the distributor *may make any warranty commitment*. This creates an internal contradiction by replacing the shall not with shall, making the limitation on warranty commitment ambigious.",

Furthermore, instead of acknowledging a 'limited' duration, the modified segment indicates that it may be 'unlimited'.",

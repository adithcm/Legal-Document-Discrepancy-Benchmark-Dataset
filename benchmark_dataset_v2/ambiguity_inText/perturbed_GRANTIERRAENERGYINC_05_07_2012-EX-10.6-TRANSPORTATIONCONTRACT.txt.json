                "changed_text": "2.1.10. Barrel: means a volume equal to 42 United States of America gallons. Each gallon is equal to four liters (4).",
                "explanation": "The term ‘Barrel’ is redefined with a different volume for each gallon, creating a contradiction. The original definition states each gallon is equal to 3.7853 liters, whereas the altered definition changes this to a whole 4 liters. This contradiction could lead to disputes when calculating total volumes in the contract.",

                "explanation": "The clause now provides that while third parties can access if there is available capacity and requirements are fulfilled, Ecopetrol will need to approve it. This introduces ambiguity because approval is now an added requirement.",

In the event in which the sum of the volumes requested by the Senders exceeds the effective Transportation Capacity, o when due to the events mentioned in numeral 8.7.2 the effective Transportation Capacity is reduced below the sum of the volumes assigned to the Senders, the Transporter shall calculate the volumes assigned in the Transportation schedule to each Sender according to the following priorities:",

                "explanation": "The introduction of 'unless Transporter's judgment differs' adds ambiguity as it allows deviations from the stated priorities, making it unclear whether the priorities are binding or discretionary. It introduces uncertainty and potential for dispute over the allocation of transportation capacity.",

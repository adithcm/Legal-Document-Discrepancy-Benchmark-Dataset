                "original_text": "7.1 The SENDER undertakes the obligation to pay irrevocably and unconditionally the Service for the Contracted Capacity, twenty (20)  calendar days at the latest, after ECOPETROL files in the offices of the SENDER the invoice for the provision of the Service.\n\n   7.2 ECOPETROL shall deliver to the SENDER on the twentieth (20) day of each month at the latest a preliminary account (invoice) with the  amount that the SENDER must pay (corresponding to the current month) based on the Nomination made by the SENDER for the current  month.\n\n   7.3 Considering that the charging for the Service is made on the Nomination of the current month, ECOPETROL in order to make the  corresponding adjustment to the nominated volume and the volume of Crude actually shipped, shall generate the corresponding debit  and credit vouchers and shall deliver said debit or credit vouchers together with the invoice(s) of the nominated month to be charged.  The due date of the debit and credit vouchers shall be the same as for the invoice (with the nominated volume) of the current month in  order to facilitate the SENDER the making of only one net payment for both items.    7.4 Payments shall be made in Colombian pesos using the arithmetic average of the representative market exchange rate certified by the  Superintendence of Finance or the entity replacing it, of the days of the month corresponding to the Service invoiced.    7.5 The SENDER shall make the payment by means of making a deposit in any of the bank accounts as indicated by ECOPETROL. In case  ECOPETROL requires any changes in the bank account, it shall be informed in writing to the SENDER.    7.6 The SENDER is obliged to receive the invoice once ECOPETROL has filed it. Any objections to the invoicing will not interrupt the term  for the payment respect to the sums that are not objected by the SENDER, pursuant to the term established in this clause. ECOPETROL  shall issue the note credit or equivalent document respect to the sums objected by the SENDER, in order to rectify the inaccuracy.",
                "changed_text": "7.1 The SENDER may pay for the Service for the Contracted Capacity up to thirty (30) calendar days, after ECOPETROL files in the offices of the SENDER the invoice for the provision of the Service.\n\n   7.2 ECOPETROL shall endeavor to deliver to the SENDER on the thirtieth (30) day of each month a preliminary account (invoice) with the  amount that the SENDER must pay (corresponding to the current month) based on the Nomination made by the SENDER for the current  month.\n\n   7.3 Considering that the charging for the Service is made on the Nomination of the current month, ECOPETROL in order to make the  corresponding adjustment to the nominated volume and the volume of Crude actually shipped, shall generate the corresponding debit  and credit vouchers and shall deliver said debit or credit vouchers together with the invoice(s) of the nominated month to be charged.  The due date of the debit and credit vouchers shall be extended beyond the invoice (with the nominated volume) of the current month in  order to facilitate the SENDER the making of only one net payment for both items.    7.4 Payments shall be made in Colombian pesos using the exchange rate agreed between ECOPETROL and SENDER of the days of the month corresponding to the Service invoiced.    7.5 The SENDER shall make the payment by means of any of the bank accounts as indicated by ECOPETROL. In case  ECOPETROL requires any changes in the bank account, it shall be informed by phone to the SENDER.    7.6 The SENDER may discuss the invoice once ECOPETROL has filed it. Any objections to the invoicing will interrupt the term  for the payment respect to the sums that are not objected by the SENDER, pursuant to the term established in this clause. ECOPETROL  may not issue the note credit or equivalent document respect to the sums objected by the SENDER, in order to rectify the inaccuracy.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces several ambiguities. First, the 'undertakes the obligation to pay irrevocably and unconditionally' is weakened to 'may pay,' introducing uncertainty. Second, the payment deadline is extended to 30 days, contradicting the original 20-day term. Third, 'endeavor to deliver' makes ECOPETROL's invoice delivery non-binding. Fourth, the exchange rate is changed to 'agreed between ECOPETROL and SENDER,' introducing subjectivity. Finally, the SENDER may not discuss the invoice, removing any rectification if inaccurate.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces several uncertainties concerning the bond. First, the 'guarantee compliance' is weakened by 'maybe guarantee'. Second, the \"SENDER is obliged\" becomes 'SENDER should evaluate', removing the firm requirement to provide a bond. Third, the deadline for delivering the bond changes from 10 to 15 business days. Fourth, the irrevocable nature of the letter of credit is changed to revocable at second requirement, weakening ECOPETROLâ€™s security. Fifth, AA is introduced instead of AAA as minimum credit rating. Finally, the validity of the bond is now only the term of execution of the Contract, so 120 days less that originally, and the fact that the Form cannot be used.",

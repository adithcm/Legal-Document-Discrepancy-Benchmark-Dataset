                "original_text": "1.1.7 Actual revenues: means the revenues payable by Party B to Party A based on the amount of search traffic generated by Party A's website for Party B, less Party B's related costs and legal taxes and charges. The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party B based on its statistical data.",

The search traffic generated by Party A for Party B, which forms the basis for calculating the actual revenues, shall be determined by Party A based on its own statistical data, which Party B must approve.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in how 'Actual revenues' are calculated. Initially, Party B determined the search traffic, which directly impacts revenue. The modified version gives Party A the initial determination power, subject to Party B's approval. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over the validity of the revenue calculation and whose data prevails.",

In the event that Party A breaches this covenant, Party B shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time and shall not pay any share of profits to Party A.",
                "changed_text": "4.2.6 Party A covenants that during the Cooperation Term, it will endeavor to list Party B's search engine service as one of its search engine services, of which \"Cheetah Browser\" may list Party B's search engine service as a frequently used, but not necessarily default, search engine service. In the event that Party A breaches this covenant, Party B shall have the right to request a formal review of the cooperation agreement, but termination and non-payment are not guaranteed.",
                "explanation": "The original text makes it mandatory for Party A to list Party B's search engine as the default, with clear consequences (termination, no payment) for breach. The modified version softens the obligation by using 'endeavor' and 'may list as frequently used,' making it less binding. The consequences for breach are also downgraded, creating a conflict in how strictly Party A's obligation is enforced. It's now unclear if not having it as default constitutes a breach.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity regarding the termination of the agreement in case of Force Majeure. Initially, either party had the right to terminate after 30 days. Now, the 'may terminate' is replaced with 'may consider the possibility of terminating,' and the termination is subject to discussion and not guaranteed. This creates uncertainty about whether a Force Majeure event automatically allows for termination or if it requires further negotiation, potentially disadvantaging one party.",

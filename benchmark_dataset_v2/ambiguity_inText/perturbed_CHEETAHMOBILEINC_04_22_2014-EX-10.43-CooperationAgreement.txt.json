                "explanation": "This change introduces inconsistencies in the definitions. 'PRC Laws' is narrowed to exclude future laws, 'Trade Secrets' excludes 'business information','Effective Date' requires mutual written agreement conflicting with the original automatic definition, Force Majeure is changed omitting 'foreseeable' and altering the included events, 'Baidu Website' is broadened to include subdomains, 'Cooperation Term' is modified to include an automatic renewal clause, and 'Actual Revenues' gives Party A discretion in calculating revenues, contradicting the original definition that relies on Party B's statistical data.",

                "explanation": "The original text defines a fixed cooperation term of two years. This modification contradicts that by introducing automatic yearly extensions, referencing the altered definition in Section 1.1.6. This creates a conflict regarding the agreement's duration.",

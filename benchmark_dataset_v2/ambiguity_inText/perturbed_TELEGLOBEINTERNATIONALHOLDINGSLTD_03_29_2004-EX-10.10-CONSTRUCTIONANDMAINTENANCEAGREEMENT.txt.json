DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n\n1.1 The following definitions and interpretations shall apply to certain terms used in this Agreement:\n\n(a) Affiliate: A company is the Affiliate of another if either company owns directly or indirectly less than 50% but no less than 10% of its equity.",

                "explanation": "The original definition states an affiliate is a company owning between 10% and 50% equity. The modified definition changes the lower bound to 20%, creating a contradiction. This will cause confusion when determining which entities qualify as affiliates, potentially impacting clauses that depend on affiliate status (e.g., transfer of capacity in section 12).",

Where the use of a Terminal Station or of certain equipment situated therein, such as power supply or testing and maintenance equipment, is shared, by agreement of the Parties, by the APCN 2 and other communications systems terminating at that Terminal Station, the costs of operation and maintenance of such shared Terminal Station or equipment (not solely attributable to a particular communication system or systems) will be allocated among the systems involved in the proportions in which they use the shared equipment or facility. For such purposes, the Management Committee shall approve the method for determining the portion of a shared Terminal Station allocable to the APCN 2. Costs as used in this Paragraph 6 with reference to each of the Terminal Stations shall include costs reasonably incurred in operation and maintenance of the facilities involved, including, but not limited to, the cost of attendance, testing, adjustments, repairs and replacements, customs duties, taxes (except income tax imposed upon the net income of a Party) paid in respect of such facilities, billing activities, administrative costs, financial charges, and costs and expenses reasonably incurred on account of claims made by or against other persons in respect of such facilities or any part thereof and damages or compensation payable by the Terminal Station owner on account of such claims;",

                "explanation": "Original text says the costs should be allocated proportionally between multiple systems that use the same Terminal station. The modified text states the costs of a shared Terminal Station are allocated solely to APCN 2. This creates a direct conflict on how O&M costs for shared facilities are to be allocated which can have monetary impact.",

                "explanation": "Section 12.1 strictly restricts capacity usage to carriers. The modified text introduces an exception, allowing non-carriers to use capacity with Management Committee approval. This weakens the original restriction and can lead to disputes about what constitutes 'approval' and under what circumstances it should be granted.",

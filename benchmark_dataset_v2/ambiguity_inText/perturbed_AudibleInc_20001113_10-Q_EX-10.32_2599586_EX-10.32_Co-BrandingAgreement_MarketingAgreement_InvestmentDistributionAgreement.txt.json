                "changed_text": "\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person or entity (including either Party), any other person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with that person or entity. For the purposes of revenue sharing under Section 5.4, an affiliate is any entity in which a party holds at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the equity interests therein.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is changed to include a different threshold for equity interests (25% instead of 50%) specifically for revenue sharing calculations. This creates a contradiction, as an entity could be considered an affiliate for revenue sharing but not for other contractual obligations.",

Confidential Information includes, without limitation, (a) all information relating to a Party's or its Affiliates' technology, customers, business plans, promotional and marketing activities, finances and other business affairs; (b) all third party information that a Party or its Affiliates is obligated to keep confidential; and (c) the terms of this Agreement. Confidential Information may be contained in tangible materials, such as drawings, data, specifications, reports and computer programs, or may be in the nature of unwritten knowledge. Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) has become publicly available without breach of this Agreement, (ii) can be shown by documentation to have been known to the Receiving Party at the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates without a breach of confidentiality or other improper means, (iii) is received from a third party who did not acquire or disclose such information by a wrongful or tortious act or (iv) can be shown by documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to any Confidential Information.",

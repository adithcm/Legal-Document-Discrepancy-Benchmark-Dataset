                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 30-day written notice for termination without penalty, while the modified version requires 60 days notice and a $10,000 penalty. This creates a contradiction regarding the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated.",

                "explanation": "The original text mentions after 30 days, UTK *shall have the right* to present the technology to other clients, implying an option. The modified version changes it to *shall* present the technology to other clients, making it an obligation. The other contradiction is that the original text says UTK does *not* control whether technology will be shown to other parties, whereas the modified one says that it *does* control it. This changes the degree of control that UTEK has, and also creates an obligation to the other clients which can be confusing.",

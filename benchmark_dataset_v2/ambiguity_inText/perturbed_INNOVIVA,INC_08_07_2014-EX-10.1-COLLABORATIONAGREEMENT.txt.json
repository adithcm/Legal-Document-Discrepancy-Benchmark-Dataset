Under the direction of the Joint Project Committee, specific Pooled Compounds will be identified from time to time and, as applicable, selected for Development as a Collaboration Product. The Joint Project Committee will determine the number and extent of Development of the Pooled Compounds and the criteria to be used for selecting among the eight Pooled Compounds and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, will endeavor to move one or more such Collaboration Products forward in Development. In relation to the foregoing, GSK shall have the overall responsibility for, and use Diligent Efforts in, the performance of all such Development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product moved forward in Development. Further, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product. GSK shall also use Diligent Efforts to contribute at least one ICS and/or other non-LABA compound to the collaboration for the purpose of developing a combination product and Diligent Efforts to develop an optimal inhaled formulation of Collaboration Product in a device which may be either/or a dry powder inhaler formulation and/or a metered dose inhaler formulation of the Collaboration Compound and Development activities of such may continue in parallel.",

Under the direction of the Joint Project Committee, specific Pooled Compounds will be identified from time to time and, as applicable, selected for Development as a Collaboration Product. The Joint Project Committee will provide suggestions on the number and extent of Development of the Pooled Compounds and the criteria to be used for selecting among the eight Pooled Compounds and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, GSK has the option to move one or more such Collaboration Products forward in Development. In relation to the foregoing, GSK may delegate overall responsibility for, and may use reasonable efforts in, the performance of some Development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product moved forward in Development. Further, GSK will attempt to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product. GSK will explore contributing at least one ICS and/or other non-LABA compound to the collaboration for the purpose of developing a combination product and will explore developing an inhaled formulation of Collaboration Product in a device which may be either/or a dry powder inhaler formulation and/or a metered dose inhaler formulation of the Collaboration Compound and Development activities of such may continue in parallel.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that GSK 'shall have overall responsibility and use Diligent Efforts' and 'shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product.' This was changed to be far more flexible and vague with words like 'may delegate' and 'attempt to'. This introduces ambiguity, making performance non-binding and subject to GSK's discretion, thus creating potential disputes. This contradiction matters because different sections could imply specific requirements to move these projects along, however now GSK can say they are only attempting and exploring, not obligated to the fullest extent.",

Diligent Efforts requires that: (i) each Party promptly assign responsibility for such obligations to specific employee(s) who are held accountable for progress and monitor such progress on an on-going basis, (ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party consistently make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of Diligent Efforts provides detail and constraints. However, the changed definition is shorter and leaves out the details such as 'consistent with the efforts a Party devotes to a product of similar market potential, profit potential or strategic value resulting from its own research efforts, based on conditions then prevailing and as if there were no Competing Product owned by such Party, with the objective of launching a single agent Collaboration Product and a combination agent Collaboration Product in accordance with the Development principles more specifically outlined in Section 4.2.4' and '(ii) each Party set and consistently seek to achieve specific and meaningful objectives for carrying out such obligations, and (iii) each Party consistently make and implement decisions and allocate resources designed to advance progress with respect to such objectives.' Now there are no requirements to make decisions or allocate resources, this creates ambiguity and undermines the intention of Diligent Efforts.",

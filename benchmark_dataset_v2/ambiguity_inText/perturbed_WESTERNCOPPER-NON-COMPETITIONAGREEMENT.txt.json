                "changed_text": "Area of Non-Competition means the State of Zacatecas, Mexico only.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Area of Non-Competition.' Initially, it included a 20km buffer around mineral properties. The revised definition removes this buffer, potentially leading to disputes about where the non-competition clause applies.",

However, Western Copper is permitted to advise any Person who carries on or is engaged in Mining Activities in the Area of Non-Competition.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction regarding Western Copper's ability to advise entities involved in mining activities. The initial clause prohibited advising such entities, while the revision explicitly allows it, making the scope of the non-competition agreement unclear.",

However, termination will not be effective if Glamis demonstrates recovery within that 30-day period.",
                "explanation": "The original clause allowed immediate termination upon the listed events. The modified clause introduces a 30-day delay and a 'cure' period for Glamis, contradicting the immediate termination provision. This creates uncertainty about the termination process.",

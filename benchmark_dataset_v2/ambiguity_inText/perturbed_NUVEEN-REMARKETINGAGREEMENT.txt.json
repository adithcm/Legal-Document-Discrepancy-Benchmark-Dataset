This introduces ambiguity because it becomes unclear whether other Remarketing Agents can be appointed and what the rights and responsibilities are if multiple agents exist, potentially contradicting other sections assuming single agent.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement, or the Supplement' to 'Implied covenants or obligations may be read into this Agreement, or the Supplement' creates a direct contradiction.

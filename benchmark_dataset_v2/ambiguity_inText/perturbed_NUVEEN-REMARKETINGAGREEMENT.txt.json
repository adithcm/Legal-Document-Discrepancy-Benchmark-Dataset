                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating the Remarketing Memorandum can be used regardless of Fund Approval, potentially conflicting with the original intent of the Remarketing Memorandum. This creates ambiguity by not aligning with other clauses where written consent is required.",

The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent shall incur no liability to the Fund, the Investment Adviser, the Calculation and Paying Agent or to any Beneficial Owner (or its Agent Member) or any Holder of the VRRM-MFP Shares in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, in connection with its duties under this Agreement and the Supplement or otherwise, except as a result of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.",

It states that the Remarketing Agent will incur liability to the Fund, the Investment Advisor, the Calculation and Paying Agent, and any Beneficial Owner for any action or failure to act regardless of good faith. This contradicts the original text, which stated that the Remarketing Agent would only be liable in the case of bad faith, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.",

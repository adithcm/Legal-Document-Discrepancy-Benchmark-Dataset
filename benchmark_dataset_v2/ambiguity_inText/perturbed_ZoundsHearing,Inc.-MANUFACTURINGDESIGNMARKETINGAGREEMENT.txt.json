                "original_text": "The agreed upon delivery dates are based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current inventory, commitments and Subcontractor's advice. Manufacturer agrees and acknowledges that all shipment dates are firm delivery dates. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least five days prior to shipment. In addition to the purchase price, Manufacturer shall pay any and all transportation charges (including insurance).

                "changed_text": "The agreed upon delivery dates are estimates based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current inventory, commitments and Subcontractor's advice. While the Subcontractor will endeavor to meet these estimates, Manufacturer acknowledges that all shipment dates are targets, not guarantees. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least five days prior to shipment.

                "explanation": "The original text states 'all shipment dates are firm delivery dates', which suggests a binding obligation on the Subcontractor. The modified text uses 'estimates' and 'targets, not guarantees', creating ambiguity about the enforceability of delivery dates. The original text states the title transfer to manufacturer upon receipt of the manufacturer's products, while the updated text states title transfer upon pickup of the manufacturer's products. This makes it unclear when exactly the manufacturer assumes responsibility for the products.",

Both Manufacturer and Subcontractor shall be responsible for complying with all federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like in the United States and in other countries as they may pertain to the Manufacturer's Products and to the obligations on the Parties to perform under this Agreement, including, without limitation, requirements in the United States with respect to registration of establishment, listing of medical devices, reporting of deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions under 21 CFR Medical Device Regulations and the potential therefore, tracking of medical devices, recalls, safety alerts and process controls. In no event shall either Party assume any risk arising out of the other Party's failure to comply with such laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like, and each Party shall cooperate with the other in all respects to facilitate and promote strict compliance with the provisions of this Section 14.",
                "changed_text": "Manufacturer shall use its best efforts to be registered as the manufacturer of Manufacturer's Products and shall attempt to obtain such approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and other regulatory bodies, public or private as may be required to manufacture and sell the products in the United States or internationally. The Manufacturer is primarily responsible for complying with all federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and the like in the United States and in other countries as they may pertain to the Manufacturer's Products and to the obligations on the Parties to perform under this Agreement, including, without limitation, requirements in the United States with respect to registration of establishment, listing of medical devices, reporting of deaths, serious injuries and certain malfunctions under 21 CFR Medical Device Regulations and the potential therefore, tracking of medical devices, recalls, safety alerts and process controls.

                "explanation": "The original text states that 'Both Manufacturer and Subcontractor shall be responsible for complying with all federal, state and local laws'. This is now modified to state 'The Manufacturer is primarily responsible'. This creates a contradiction, as the Subcontractor's degree of responsibility is now unclear, and it is no longer explicitly stated that the Subcontractor must comply with all the laws. Furthermore, the Manufacturer's obligation to 'be registered' and 'obtain approvals' is downgraded to using 'best efforts' and 'attempt to obtain,' weakening the original commitment and creating a gap in enforceability.",

The Manufacturer shall have the right to purchase any tooling or testing equipment used in connection with this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that all tooling is owned by the Subcontractor. The changed text introduces ambiguity with 'primarily' and an exception 'unless otherwise agreed to in writing'. This creates a potential contradiction and dispute regarding ownership, particularly if there's no written agreement. The fact that the Manufacturer can purchase the equipment further adds confusion as to ownership.",

EFS agrees that it will use the merchandising presence on the EFS Portals to also market the Websites in  order to drive additional customer acquisition.",

EFS is prohibited from using the merchandising presence on the EFS Portals to also market the Websites, maintaining a strict separation between the two platforms.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding EFS's ability to market the Websites through EFS Portals. The original text encourages it, while the modified text prohibits it, creating ambiguity in the contract.",

EFS shall be responsible for fulfilling orders of all semi- customized Merchandise, including fulfilling any build-to-order or special features requested by the customer, as permitted during  the order process.",

Client retains the sole discretion to allow customers to select and order pre-configured semi-customized Merchandise. Client shall be responsible for fulfilling orders of all semi-customized Merchandise.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that mass-customized merchandise *shall* be available while the modified states it *may not*. The modified text then contradicts itself by stating client is responsible for fulfilling the orders, when no merchandise may exist.  This change introduces ambiguity around whether customized merchandise is offered and who is responsible for which tasks.",

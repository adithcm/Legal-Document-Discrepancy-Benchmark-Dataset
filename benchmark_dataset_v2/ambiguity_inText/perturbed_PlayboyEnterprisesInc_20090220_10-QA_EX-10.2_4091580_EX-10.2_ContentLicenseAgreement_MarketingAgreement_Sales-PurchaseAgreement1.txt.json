If EFS desires to use any other domain names or Internet locators/designators in connection with the Websites, Micro Sites or otherwise utilizing PLAYBOY- or PLAYBOY-related marks, EFS shall so notify Client, which may at its sole discretion, choose to register the same at its expense. Any such additional domain names or Internet locators/designators shall be owned by PEII as registrant, and EFS shall receive a limited license to use the same as Licensed Domain Names hereunder, solely in connection with the Websites and/or Micro Sites during the Term. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, the Licensed Domain Names shall at all times remain on PEII servers and will be redirected to the Websites.",

If EFS desires to use any other domain names or Internet locators/designators in connection with the Websites, Micro Sites or otherwise utilizing PLAYBOY- or PLAYBOY-related marks, EFS may register the same, with Clientâ€™s consent. Any such additional domain names or Internet locators/designators shall be owned by EFS as registrant, and EFS shall receive full ownership to use the same as Licensed Domain Names hereunder, solely in connection with the Websites and/or Micro Sites during the Term. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, the Licensed Domain Names may be transferred to EFS servers and will be redirected to the Websites, if deemed by EFS.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that PEII will own any additional domain names, contradicting the modification where EFS can own the domain names. This creates confusion over who owns the domain names and has the rights to manage the domains.",

EFS shall not cause, condone or authorize: (x) the use of any substandard or offensive materials in or in connection with any of the Merchandise; (y) any violation of any Law, including, but not limited to, provisions thereof imposing advertising standards or requiring trade or content description of the Merchandise; or (z) the use of any Playboy Mark or any other word, device or symbol associated in any way with any or all of Client and its subsidiaries and affiliates in connection with any product or activity that is not the subject of this Agreement.",

EFS shall use reasonable efforts to avoid causing, condoning or authorizing: (x) the knowing use of obviously substandard or intentionally offensive materials in or in connection with any of the Merchandise; (y) any clear violation of any critical Law, including provisions thereof imposing advertising standards or requiring trade or content description of the Merchandise; or (z) the use of any Playboy Mark or any other word, device or symbol associated in any way with any or all of Client and its subsidiaries and affiliates in connection with any product or activity that is not the subject of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original language is very strict ('all respects,' 'shall not'). The modified language is weaker and less certain ('substantially conform,' 'should not knowingly violate,' 'reasonable efforts'). The introduction of qualifiers like 'substantially', 'obvious', 'intentionally', and 'clear' makes the obligation of EFS less definite and enforceable. This is a contradiction if other sections of the agreement require strict compliance.",

                "changed_text": "EFS will consider merchandising individual items based on suggestions from Client aligning with Client's retail strategies or new Client media promotions; however, final unit decisions remain at EFS's sole discretion, with occasional alignment with market trends. The client could give advice, but EFS doesn't need to take the action.",
                "explanation": "This modification weakens Client's control. 'EFS agrees that it will merchandise individual items as directed by Client' becomes 'EFS will consider merchandising individual items based on suggestions from Client.' The phrase 'as directed by Client' is replaced with 'suggestions from Client,' indicating that EFS has no obligation to follow Client's directions. This creates an internal contradiction regarding how much control Client has in the merchandising decisions.",

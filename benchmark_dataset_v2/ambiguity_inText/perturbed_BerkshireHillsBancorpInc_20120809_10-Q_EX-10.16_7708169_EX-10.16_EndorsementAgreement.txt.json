                "changed_text": "b) \"CONTRACT TERRITORY\" shall be the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut only.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'CONTRACT TERRITORY' includes any state where Berkshire offers Banking Services at any point during the contract period. The modified definition limits the territory to only Massachusetts and Connecticut. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the scope of Auriemma's endorsement obligations and Berkshire's rights to use his identification in advertising, particularly if Berkshire expands its services to other states.",

                "explanation": "The original clause establishes a 'deemed approval' mechanism if Auriemma does not disapprove the use of his identification within ten business days. The modified clause requires explicit written approval and explicitly states that silence is not approval. This creates a contradiction regarding the approval process, leading to potential disputes over whether certain uses of Auriemma's identification were properly authorized.",

At the conclusion of this period, Berkshire's use of the printed material will  cease.",
                "changed_text": "Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreement is  terminated for any reason, Berkshire may continue to use any printed material already produced under this Agreement indefinitely. There is no termination of the use of the printed material.",
                "explanation": "Originally, Berkshire can use printed materials for 30 days after termination, except if terminated because of Berkshire's material breach. The modified version allows indefinite use of printed materials regardless of the reason for termination. This creates a contradiction in the terms governing the use of materials post-termination, leading to uncertainty regarding Berkshire's rights after the contract ends.",

                "changed_text": "a) \"CONTRACT PERIOD\" means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2016, regardless of any termination events described later in the agreement. b) \"SERVICES PERIOD\" means that period of time commencing upon the full execution of this Agreement by both Parties and terminating on May 31, 2014 unless sooner terminated under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The modification to the CONTRACT PERIOD definition creates a contradiction. The original definition allows for early termination, but the altered definition states it terminates on May 31, 2016, regardless. This introduces uncertainty about whether the contract period can be terminated early, leading to potential disputes.",

                "explanation": "Section 7 originally stipulates that all uses of the Auriemma Identification must be approved before being made. The modified section removes the 'shall not be made unless and until finished samples of such proposed use have been provided to Auriemma and such use has been approved by Auriemma or Auriemma's authorized representative' portion. Also the time to respond to an approaval is changed to 30 days instead of 10. This creates a contradiction because part (a) still requires approval, yet part (b) implies that Berkshire can use the Auriemma Identification, provided it's submitted for review and not rejected after 30 days. This leads to ambiguity about whether pre-approval is truly necessary, creating an internal contradiction within the agreement.",

Either Party shall have the right, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, to terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches its obligation hereunder and such breach remains uncured. A material breach occurs if either Party (i) fails to make any payment, or (ii) fails to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements, or obligations (other than payments of money). Upon the breach of either of the above conditions, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: (A) as to a default under clause (i) above, if payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment; or (B) as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default and such action the defaulting party must take in order to cure each such item of default.",

                "explanation": "This modification alters the termination clause, creating a conflict in the cure period for payment defaults. Originally, failure to pay requires a 10-day cure period after notice. In the edited version, (A) has been changed to sixty (60) days, drastically extending the cure period, making it inconsistent with the intent of prompt payment. While (B) remains at thirty (30) days for other breaches, there is no mention that payment defaults are exempt from this rule. This creates a conflicting ambiguity over the cure period for the same breach (payment failure), opening the possibility of a breach if the party fails to pay at 10 days, but arguing that there are 60 days to be in compliance.",

                "original_text": "The Adviser shall give the Trust the benefit of its best judgment, efforts and facilities in rendering its services. The Adviser shall at all times conform to: (i) all applicable provisions of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) the provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust; and (iv) any other applicable provisions of state and federal law.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser shall give the Trust the benefit of its best judgment, efforts and facilities in rendering its services. While the Adviser should generally conform to: (i) all applicable provisions of the Act and any rules and regulations adopted thereunder; (ii) the provisions of the Registration Statement of the Trust under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act as amended from time to time; (iii) the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws of the Trust; and (iv) any other applicable provisions of state and federal law, flexibility is permitted where strict adherence hinders the Fund's performance.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates strict adherence to all regulations and governing documents. The modified text introduces ambiguity by allowing 'flexibility' under certain circumstances, which contradicts the strict adherence requirement, leading to uncertainty about compliance obligations. This creates an internal contradiction with another part of the contract enforcing strict adherence to the Act.",

The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Adviser agrees to indemnify the Trust for inaccurate statements in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, but this indemnity shall be capped at $100,000.  The Adviser will only defend the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against liability for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement provides for unlimited indemnification for inaccuracies in the prospectus. The modified version introduces a financial cap of $100,000, directly contradicting the original unlimited liability. Furthermore, it removes the indemnity clause for liability, losses, claims and damages arising from inaccurate or incomplete statement. This makes it unclear if the adviser needs to indemnify or defend.",

This Agreement may only be terminated by the Trust without the payment of any penalty upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Adviser. The Adviser may terminate this agreement with 60 days written notice, subject to a penalty of $50,000.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement allows either party to terminate the agreement with 60 days notice without penalty. The modified agreement creates an asymmetry, allowing the Trust to terminate without penalty but imposing a $50,000 penalty on the Adviser for the same action. This contradicts the initial statement of equal termination rights.",

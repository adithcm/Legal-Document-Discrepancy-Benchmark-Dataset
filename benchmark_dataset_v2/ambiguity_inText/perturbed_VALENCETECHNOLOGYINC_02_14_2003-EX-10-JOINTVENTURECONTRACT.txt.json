                "changed_text": "Article 1 In accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Joint Ventures Using Chinese and Foreign Investment (the \"Joint Venture Law\") and other relevant Chinese laws and regulations, Fengfan Group Limited Liability Company and Valence Technology Inc., agree to consider a possible joint investment to discuss the establishment of a joint venture enterprise in Baoding City, Hebei Province of the People's Republic of China. Final decision depends on further negotiations and market conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a clear agreement to jointly invest. The modified text changes this to a consideration of a possible joint investment, making the commitment ambiguous. This introduces uncertainty about the parties' actual obligations and intentions.",

Party B also guarantees that any new inventions and improvements in the proprietary technology for production of Batteries shall be provided to the Joint Venture Company at no fee, excepting reimbursement of any direct travel or communication costs required for the provision of such technology, consistent with the terms of the Contract for Technology Investment.",

While Party B intends to provide new inventions and improvements in the proprietary technology for production of Batteries to the Joint Venture Company, the terms of this provision are subject to good-faith negotiations and a separate agreement regarding fair market value compensation.",
                "explanation": "The original text provides a guarantee of not transferring technology to third parties and providing new inventions at no fee (except travel/communication costs). The modified text removes the guarantee of not transferring all technology and introduces the possibility of charging a fee for new inventions through separate negotiations. This creates conflicting signals about the Joint Venture Company's access to and exclusivity of Party B's technology.",

The specific number and qualifications of the Working Personnel shall be determined by the CEO in accordance with the operating needs of the Joint Venture Company. All employees hired by the Joint Venture Company must complete satisfactorily a six-month probationary period of employment before they will be considered regular employees of the Joint Venture Company.",
                "changed_text": "Article 79 Employees will be selected primarily based on their personal connections to Party A executives, but professional qualifications and working experience may also be considered where applicable. The specific number of Working Personnel shall be determined at the sole discretion of Party A representatives without needing to consult the CEO. The probationary period for certain employees may be waived at the discretion of Party A executives, and those employees will be considered regular employees of the Joint Venture Company upon hiring.",
                "explanation": "The original text describes an objective hiring process based on merit and a standard probationary period. The modified text introduces preferential treatment based on connections, shifts hiring decisions away from the CEO and introduces potential waiver of probationary periods at Party A's discretion. This clashes with the concept of uniform employment standards as mentioned in Article 77 and potentially creates conflicts with Article 80.",

The specific number and qualifications of the Working Personnel shall be determined by the CEO in accordance with the operating needs of the Page 19 Joint Venture Company. All employees hired by the Joint Venture Company must complete satisfactorily a six-month probationary period of employment before they will be considered regular employees of the Joint Venture Company.",

All employees hired by the Joint Venture Company are immediately considered regular employees of the Joint Venture Company upon hiring.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the probationary period. The original text states a six-month probationary period is required before an employee is considered regular, while the modified version states that employees are immediately considered regular employees upon hiring. This creates uncertainty about the actual employment status and rights of new hires.",

In the original text, the Board of Directors determines the allocations to the Three Funds, with a maximum limit of 10% of after-tax profit.

                "changed_text": "In this Agreement, the following words and expressions shall have the       following meanings:\n\n\"Acceptance\" or \"Accepted\"      Means provisional acceptance of any part or the whole of the                                       System by the Publishers when the System                                       has initially passed the acceptance                                       tests in accordance with Clause 9 below                                       but for the avoidance of doubt does not                                       refer to the continuing Services after the                                       Site goes live.",
                "explanation": "The term 'Acceptance' is initially defined as acceptance upon successfully passing tests in Clause 9. By changing it to 'provisional acceptance', it introduces ambiguity about whether this initial acceptance is final or subject to further conditions. This could create disputes regarding when the system is truly accepted, and when HealthGate is entitled to final payment. If the term Acceptance is used somewhere else in the legal text, this would result in ambiguities.",

If the Publishers exercise their right to renew,             the term of the Services shall be extended by one further year, up             to and including 28 February 2001. The Use Fees shall remain the             same as in the Initial Period and the fee for the Services shall not             exceed $7000 for additional journals, $2000 maintenance fee on             existing journals and $2000 per Gigabyte.",
                "changed_text": "The Publishers shall have the right to renew the term of the             Services by notice in writing to HealthGate to be given on or before             30 September 1999. If the Publishers exercise their right to renew,             the term of the Services shall be extended, subject to mutual agreement on new terms to be negotiated in good faith.  The Use Fees shall be re-negotiated and finalized by both parties before the renewal goes into effect.",
                "explanation": "This change replaces the specific renewal terms (date, fees) with a vague agreement to negotiate new terms. The original contract stated the Use Fees shall remain the same, whereas, the modified version introduced the Use Fees to be re-negotiated, creating an ambiguity. This can lead to disputes if the parties cannot agree on new terms, or if one party believes the other is not negotiating in good faith. This creates an **internal contradiction** if another part of the contract enforces renewal on specified terms.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding HealthGate's obligation to host the site according to the specification. By changing 'will host' to 'will endeavor to host' and adding 'subject to reasonable downtime', it provides HealthGate with more wiggle room. If other clauses depend on strict adherence to the Specification, this change will create inconsistencies and uncertainties about the availability and functionality of the site.",

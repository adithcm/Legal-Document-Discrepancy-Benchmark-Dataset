                "explanation": "The original text states 'Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its employees or Affiliates' in subsection (i) and 'Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its advisors, agents, contractors or lenders' in subsection (ii). The modified text limits the responsibility for employee breaches to only intentional and malicious acts and explicitly removes any responsibility for breaches by advisors, agents, contractors, or lenders. This creates a conflict, as the general statement of responsibility is contradicted by these exceptions. This would create ambiguity and uncertainty in the event of a breach of confidentiality by these entities.",

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" when used with respect to any specified Person means the power to direct the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlling\" and \"controlled\" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.\n\n\"Agreement\" has the meaning specified in the preamble to this Agreement, and includes all exhibits and schedules hereto.\n\n\"Applicable Law\" means, with reference to any Person, all Laws applicable to such Person or its property or in respect of its operations.\n\n\"Base Commission\" has the meaning specified in Section 3(c).\n\n\"BTU\" means British Thermal Units.\n\n\"Closing\" has the meaning specified in Section 1(c).\n\n\"Closing Date\" has the meaning specified in Section 1(c).\n\n\"Coal\" has the meaning specified in Section 2(a).\n\n\"Confidential Information\" means any information not in the public domain, in any form, whether acquired prior to or after the Closing Date, received by a Party from the other Party or any of its Affiliates or advisors, relating to the business and operations of such Party and its respective Affiliates, including, without limitation, information regarding vendors, suppliers, trade secrets, training programs, technical information, contracts, systems, procedures, know-how, trade names, improvements, price lists, financial or other data, business plans, computer programs, software systems, internal reports, personnel files or any other compilation of information, written or unwritten, which is or was used in the business of such Party or its Affiliates, except for information (i) that was or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by a Party receiving such information; or (ii) that is received by a Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party that is not prohibited from disclosing such information by obligation to the disclosing Party.",

                "explanation": "The term 'control' within the definition of 'Affiliate' is changed from 'power to direct the management and policies' to 'power to significantly influence the management and policies'. This makes the threshold for establishing an affiliate relationship less clear and potentially opens the door to disputes. Additionally, the definition of 'Applicable Law' is narrowed to only Laws of the United States creating a conflict if another section refers to compliance with all applicable laws, potentially encompassing international regulations as well. Finally, the exception clause of Confidential Information has been changed. It adds 'as a direct result' which would make it harder to prove something was in the public domain. It also limits the duty of the third party to only contractual obligations.",

                "explanation": "Section 10(g) states the prevailing party is entitled to attorney's fees and costs. However, by adding a restriction to actions only regarding confidential information and adding a 'bad faith' requirement, it is harder to get such attorney's fees. This creates an inconsistency by having two definitions of what occurs when an action is filed to enforce the agreement.",

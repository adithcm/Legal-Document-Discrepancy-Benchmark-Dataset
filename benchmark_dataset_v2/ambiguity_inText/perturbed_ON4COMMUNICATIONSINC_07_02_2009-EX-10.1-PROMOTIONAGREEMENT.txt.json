Such a consumer will be entitled to visit a custom interactive landing page at the CharityTunes.com website to enter the code and their email address to receive song downloads.

The modified text introduces uncertainty by stating the number of downloads is determined by Charity Tunes at redemption, removing the price constraint, and making the catalog availability a discretionary effort.",

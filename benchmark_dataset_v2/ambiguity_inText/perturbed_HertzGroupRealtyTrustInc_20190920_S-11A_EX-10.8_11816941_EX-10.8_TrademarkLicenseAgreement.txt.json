                "original_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "1.5 \"Control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person or entity, but ONLY through the ownership of voting securities.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Control'. Initially, control could be exerted through various means (ownership of voting securities, contract, etc.). The modification limits 'Control' to only the ownership of voting securities, potentially excluding other forms of influence.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding termination. The original clause allows either party to terminate with 30 days' notice. The modification adds a condition where termination can be blocked indefinitely at Licensor's discretion, creating uncertainty and conflicting termination terms.",

In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding.",

In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party upon final judgment on the merits reasonable attorneys' fees (and sales taxes thereon, if any), including attorneys' fees for any appeal, and costs incurred in bringing such suit or proceeding. However, Licensor's attorney fees are capped at $5,000, regardless of actual expenses, but no such cap applies to Licensee.",
                "explanation": "This change creates an inequitable condition regarding attorney's fees. While the original text allows the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney's fees, the modification introduces a cap specifically for Licensor's fees, while Licensee faces no such limit. This contradicts the initial principle of equal recovery and introduces a significant financial disadvantage for Licensor in potential litigation.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'specifically excludes' to 'shall also includes', the definition of Intellectual Property Rights now includes and excludes contractual rights, creating a contradiction. This would create uncertainty for example for the Trademark License Agreement referred to in Section 3.01(b).",

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the license of Honeywell IP to SpinCo should be on \"commercially reasonable terms\". The changed text says that Honeywell can decide whether to license on its own terms which might not be reasonable. This change introduces a contradiction about the terms under which Honeywell IP can be licensed.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states that SpinCo needs Honeywell's consent before taking certain actions, and that such consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. The modified clause removes the possibility of consent entirely, barring SpinCo from those actions even with Honeywell's agreement. This creates a contradiction in the agreement.",

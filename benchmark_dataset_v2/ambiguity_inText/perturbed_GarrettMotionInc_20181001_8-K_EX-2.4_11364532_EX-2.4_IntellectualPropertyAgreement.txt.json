The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain Honeywell IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, \"Honeywell Shared IP\").

Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have-made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.",

                "explanation": "This change contradicts the original perpetual license granted to SpinCo by making the license valid for only one year, with potential extensions. This introduces ambiguity because Article III initially promises SpinCo a perpetual license to the Honeywell Shared IP, vital for its ongoing operations, but the amended clause introduces a time limitation, undermining the 'perpetual' nature and creating uncertainty about long-term access. The need for case-by-case extensions adds further uncertainty.",

This creates significant ambiguity regarding liability post-assignment and could lead to legal disputes.",

Change Orders do not however cover any bug or glitch fixing produced out of the code written by Developer as any \"bug\" will be fixed by Developer for free up to 3 months after final delivery (Bug Fixing Warranty).",
                "changed_text": "CHANGE ORDERS Definition of Change Order: Any change or modification in functionality or feature or UI of the App required by VAL will be considered as a \"Change\" regardless of if it's beyond agreed functional requirements considered in this Agreement, and that shall be agree by Developer to VAL or vice versa as a \"Change Order\" in writing. Change Orders do however cover any bug or glitch fixing produced out of the code written by Developer if VAL requests a functional change related to the bug or glitch.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a Change Order as a modification *beyond* agreed functional requirements, and specifies that bug fixes are explicitly *not* change orders. The modified text contradicts this. The altered text now defines all changes, including those covered by original specification, as Change Orders, and includes bug fixes within the umbrella of Change Orders if they are related to functionality change. Now, it is ambigious what counts as a Change Order and its associated costs and implications.",

All rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall belong to VAL and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.",

All rights and title to Duesey Coffee Intellectual Property created pursuant to the Project shall belong to VAL, but the Developer retains a perpetual, royalty-free license to use the IP for portfolio and demonstration purposes.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that all IP is owned by VAL. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that IP is co-owned during the project and granting the developer a perpetual license to use it. This creates ambiguity about ownership rights, control over the IP, and potential future use.",

If VAL terminates the agreement, then VAL shall compensate the Developer up to the date of termination with a fee calculated on Pro-rata basis, unless the termination is due to Developer's gross negligence. Developer may also terminate this Agreement by giving two (2) weeks' notice in writing to VAL. It is applicable only when the project is not completed. In case Developer terminates the agreement, it shall handover the entire project related IPR, work done till date to VAL, or pay damages equivalent to the cost to complete the project.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows VAL to terminate for 'any other reason considered sufficient,' while the modified text limits VAL's termination rights to 'material breach'. Further, the original states VAL will *always* provide compensation on termination, while the modified allows a way out of this compensation if there's Developer's 'gross negligence'. It also clarifies that termination applies to *any time* and not when the project is 'not complete'. The modification now provides conflicting reasons for termination, adding ambiguity about the conditions for termination and associated damages/compensations.",

                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement is for ten (10) years commencing on the date of this Agreement. However, the agreement may be terminated early at any time, with or without cause, provided the franchisee is given a 30-day notice.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a ten-year term 'unless terminated as provided by this Agreement,' implying specific termination clauses govern. The modified version introduces a contradictory clause allowing termination 'at any time, with or without cause,' overriding the initial term and potentially conflicting with other termination clauses in the agreement. This creates ambiguity about the actual length and conditions of the franchise term.",

                "explanation": "The original text grants the franchisee sole discretion in setting prices but then requires them to follow promotional practices set by the franchisor. The modification adds that all prices and promotional practices must align with the overall brand strategy. This creates a contradiction: While the franchisee has the right to set prices, they must align with the brand strategy, which could effectively dictate price ranges and limit the franchisee's autonomy. This ambiguity leads to uncertainty about pricing control.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires the franchisee to retain all relevant bookkeeping items for three years, while the altered version reduces this time to only one year. This creates a contradiction in the amount of time that the franchisee needs to retain important documents that may be relevant to the franchise, such as for tax and revenue reconciliation or in the event of a legal dispute. The inconsistency puts the franchisee in a position where they are simultaneously in and out of compliance, dependent on which section of the contract is being followed.",

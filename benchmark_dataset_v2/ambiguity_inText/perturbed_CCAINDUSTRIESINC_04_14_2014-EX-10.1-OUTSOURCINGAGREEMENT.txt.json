During the Term of this agreement, and for a period of twenty four (24)months after Termination (the \"Withholding Period\"), Contractor may retain monies (collections in Accounts Receivable) against any reasonable anticipated deductions for product recalls, unsalables, rebates, allowances or any audits or other adjustments it deems necessary. The retention of monies shall only be to the extent that the reasonable anticipated deductions exceed the anticipated accounts receivables. At the end of the Withholding Period, Contractor shall remit to the Company the retained monies less any deductions charged by Customers against Company's Products.

The retention of monies can be applied regardless of whether the anticipated deductions exceed the anticipated accounts receivables.

                "explanation": "The 'Withholding Period' is changed from 24 months to 12 months, and the condition requiring deductions to exceed receivables for money retention is removed. This creates a conflict as the original text limits the contractor's ability to withhold funds, while the modified text broadens this ability. This makes the terms of the retention period ambiguous.",

In performing its obligations under this Agreement, each party may receive information (the \"Receiving Party\") of a confidential and proprietary nature regarding the other party, including information about such party's intellectual property and its operations, research, 5 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED marketing plans, strategies and customer lists (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). The Receiving Party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence, shall not use such Confidential Information, except as permitted hereunder, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party (the \"Disclosing Party\"). Each party shall use the same degree of care to protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature, but in no circumstances less than a commercially reasonable level of care. The Receiving Party shall ensure that its employees and agents are bound to the same obligations of confidentiality as the Receiving Party. Confidential Information shall not be deemed to include: (a) information which is known to the Receiving Party prior to the date of receipt and not obtained or derived in any manner related to this Agreement, (b) information which is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party, or (c) information which is obtained from a third party that lawfully possesses such Confidential Information and is under no obligation to keep such Confidential Information confidential. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in response to a valid court order, law, rule, regulation or other governmental action, provided that the Disclosing Party is notified in writing prior to disclosure of such Confidential Information to permit the Disclosing Party to oppose such disclosure by appropriate legal action. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon the earlier request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall (i) promptly return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information, or (ii) upon written request by the Disclosing Party, destroy all Confidential Information and provide the Disclosing Party with written certification of such destruction. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall cease all further use of any Confidential Information, whether in tangible or intangible form.",

The Receiving Party shall hold the other party's Confidential Information with reasonable confidence, and may use such Confidential Information, to further its business interests, and may disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party (the \"Disclosing Party\") if it deems it beneficial.

                "explanation": "The confidentiality obligations are significantly weakened in the modified text. The original text requires strict confidence and prohibits use/disclosure without consent, while the modified text allows use for business interests and disclosure if deemed beneficial. Further, the original text requires destruction of confidential information, while the modified text requires retention. This creates a direct contradiction on the Receiving Party’s usage of the Disclosing Party’s confidential information, which will cause a lot of tension between the parties.",

This Agreement shall be terminable as follows: (a) In the event that a party hereto commits a breach of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement the other party may terminate this Agreement (i) if such breach may be cured, upon verbal notice if the breaching party fails to cure such breach within five (5) days after its receipt of verbal notice thereof, or (ii) if such breach is incapable of cure, upon immediate verbal notice to the other party thereof (it being understood that any breach of Section 5.04 would be considered curable); (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.01, in the event that a party hereto fails to pay any amounts payable hereunder when due, the other party may terminate this Agreement (i) if such breach may be cured, without any notice required; or, (ii) if such breach is incapable of cure, upon written notice to the other party thereof; (c) In accordance with the provisions of Section 8.03; or, (d) Either party hereto may terminate this Agreement after the Initial Period upon at least one (1) months' prior written notice to the other party thereof.

                "explanation": "The original text defines termination upon 'material breach' with 30-day written notice for curable breaches. The modified text allows termination for any breach (not just material), shortens the cure period to 5 days with verbal notice, and now states that a breach of 5.04 would be considered curable which directly contradicts the original section. The notice requirement for payment failure is removed entirely in the modified text for curable breaches, directly conflicting with the original requirement of written notice. Additionally, the original requires 6 months prior written notice, while the modified text shortens the notice period to 1 month. The Company could use this to leave whenever they want, causing problems with the Contractor, who will feel cheated by the company.",

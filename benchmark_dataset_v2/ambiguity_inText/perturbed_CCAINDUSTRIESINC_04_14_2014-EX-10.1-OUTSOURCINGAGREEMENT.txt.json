                "explanation": "The original definition includes both current and prospective customers, while the modified definition restricts 'Customer' to only current customers. This creates an ambiguity regarding whether services or agreements apply to potential future customers, affecting the scope of the contract.",

This Agreement shall be terminable as follows:\n\n(d) Either party hereto may terminate this Agreement after the Initial Period upon at least six (6) months' prior written notice to the other party thereof. The Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence but with less than six (6) months' prior written notice to Contractor; provided, that in such event, the Company shall pay Contractor an amount equal to the Termination Fee.",

The Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence but with less than six (6) months' prior written notice to Contractor; provided, that in such event, the Company *may* pay Contractor an amount equal to the Termination Fee.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall' to 'may', the obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee upon early termination becomes discretionary. This creates a conflict because the original text established a clear financial consequence for the Company's early termination, now the changed text opens the possibility that the Company might not be obligated to pay the termination fee, making enforcement uncertain.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'Gross Invoiced Sales' to 'Net Invoiced Sales' directly affects the amount paid, as net sales account for deductions. Furthermore, the change from 'five (5) days' to 'thirty (30) days' drastically alters the payment timeline. This creates contradiction and will cause potential disputes over calculation and timing of payments.",

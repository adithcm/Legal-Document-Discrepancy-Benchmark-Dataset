XLI and/or WCC may renegotiate and/or cancel this Agreement at any time during its term, in the event any of the following conditions occur:\n\n1.  Any significant changes to the Benefits Schedule which cannot be cured as stated in Section 2.2 (Termination upon Breach)\n\n2.  By mutual consent of WCC and XLI to pursue other arrangements.\n\n3.  In the event either party becomes bankrupt or insolvent.\n\n2.2 Termination upon Breach. This Agreement may be terminated upon written notice by either party in the event of a default by the other party in the performance of any term or condition of this Agreement. Any termination allowed by this Agreement will take place only after written notice of default has been given to the defaulting party, providing such party with thirty (30) days in which to cure the default.",

XLI and/or WCC may renegotiate and/or cancel this Agreement at any time during its term. \n\n2.2 Termination upon Breach. This Agreement may be terminated upon written notice by either party only in the event of a default by the other party in the performance of a material term or condition of this Agreement which severely impacts the ability of the non-defaulting party to realize the core benefits of this agreement. Any termination allowed by this Agreement will take place only after written notice of default has been given to the defaulting party, providing such party with ninety (90) days in which to cure the default. In the event the breach is related to Attachment B, XLI shall have no cure period.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination for *any* breach, with a 30-day cure period. The modified text restricts termination to *material* breaches that severely impact core benefits and extends the cure period to 90 days, while also explicitly stating XLI has no cure period for Attachment B, creating a contradiction regarding the terms of breach and cure for XLI in Section 2.2 and in relation to Attachment B.",

The provisions of this paragraph will survive termination of this Agreement.\n\n(iii) Certain technical and other information provided by both XLI and WCC pursuant to this Agreement pertains to confidential matters and trade secrets of XLI and WCC, and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and is provided to each other in furtherance of internal development efforts.

Confidential information shall not include information which: (i) was known to a party without confidentiality restrictions prior to receipt hereunder, (ii) was or becomes generally publicly known through no fault of the WCC, or (iii) subsequent to receipt hereunder, is made available to a party without confidentiality restrictions by a third party who is legally entitled to do so and who is under no obligation to either party hereunder to maintain the confidentiality of such information.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that technical and other information is to be kept in strict confidence and only disclosed to those with a 'need to know.' The modified text contradicts this by allowing the parties to disclose such information to any person without prior approval and retain it indefinitely for marketing analysis. This creates ambiguity and an internal contradiction regarding the scope and duration of confidentiality obligations.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires all approvals to be in writing with a minimum of ten days for a response. A lack of response is deemed a denial. The changed text allows approvals to be requested via informal messaging platforms, shortens the response time to two days, and allows verbal responses. Furthermore, a lack of response is now deemed an approval. Finally, it alters how discretion is used. Originally it can be any manner that party wants. After the change, the party must do it in a 'commercially reasonable manner'. This creates a direct conflict regarding the manner, timing, and required form of approvals.",

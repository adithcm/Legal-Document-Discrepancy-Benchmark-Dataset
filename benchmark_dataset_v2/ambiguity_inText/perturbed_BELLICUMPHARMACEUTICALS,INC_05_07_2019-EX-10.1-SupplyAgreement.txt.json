                "explanation": "By changing 'minimum' to 'maximum', the lead time definition becomes contradictory if other sections rely on the original understanding of lead time for order fulfillment. This creates uncertainty around delivery schedules.",

                "explanation": "Changing 'non-exclusively' to 'exclusively' creates a direct contradiction with Section 2.4 (Reserved Rights), which states Miltenyi can sell to others. This makes the exclusivity unclear, and therefore creates uncertainty in enforcement. ",

As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...] to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account cost, resource and capacity requirements.",

                "explanation": "By changing the shelf life guarantee to 'equal to' the stated minimum instead of 'no less than', Miltenyi may deliver with zero days more. Then, if other sections rely on the interpretation of having the products for at least that long to produce its own products, it would result in disputes. The term equal is used in the modified sentence.",

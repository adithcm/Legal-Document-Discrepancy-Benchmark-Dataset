                "original_text": "“Affiliate” means, with respect to a Party, any corporation, association, or other entity which, directly or indirectly, controls the Party or is controlled by the Party or is under common control with such Party, where \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the affairs or management of a corporation, association, or other entity through the ownership of fifty percent Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019) or more of the voting securities or otherwise, including having the power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such corporation, association, or other entity.",
                "changed_text": "“Affiliate” means, with respect to a Party, any corporation, association, or other entity which, directly or indirectly, controls the Party or is controlled by the Party or is under common control with such Party, where \"control\" means the ability to influence the decisions of a corporation, association, or other entity through any means, including but not limited to, ownership of at least ten percent of the voting securities or holding a position on the board of directors.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies 'control' as owning fifty percent or more of the voting securities. The modified definition broadens this to 'ability to influence' with a much lower threshold of ten percent, creating a contradiction as to what constitutes an Affiliate.",

Each party can refuse to do so by notifying the other party in writing, and is not obliged to justify their refusal.",
                "explanation": "The original text says each party 'may' request compliance, which implies the request can be rejected, but it is not explicitly stated. The modified version specifies the party 'shall' request, making it mandatory, but then states a party can refuse to comply, resulting in contradiction.",

However, the minimum shelf life will be determined at Miltenyi's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the supplier 'shall ensure' the shelf life meets Exhibit B, which creates a guarantee. The modified text uses 'shall endeavor to ensure,' reducing obligation, and then states the shelf life will be 'determined at Miltenyi's sole discretion,' completely negating the reference in Exhibit B and creating a clear contradiction.",

                "explanation": "The original defines 'Expenses' related to employee benefits with a cap (23%) and occupancy expenses with specific per diem limitations. The modified definition removes the 23% cap on employee benefits and instead defers to 'reasonable market standards' paid from the wind-down budget, and occupancy is not limited to the per diem amount, but capped at the aggregate amounts. This introduces ambiguity because market standards are not defined and the Agent's risk and the Wind-Down Budget could be impacted.",

This could lead to disputes over financial responsibilities for distribution center operations.",

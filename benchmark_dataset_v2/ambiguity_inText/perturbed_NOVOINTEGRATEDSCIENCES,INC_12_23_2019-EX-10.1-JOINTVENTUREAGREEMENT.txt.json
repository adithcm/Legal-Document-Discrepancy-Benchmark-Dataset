                "original_text": "ARTICLE 8 - TERM OF AGREEMENT 8.1 The initial term of this Agreement shall, unless sooner terminated by consent of all parties, expires in five (5) years from the date of Effective Date. NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding. 8.2 It is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term will be negotiated in good faith and shall carry terms very close to the original Agreement. 8.3 Both parties may enter into buyout negotiations with the other Party on terms agreeable to both Parties.",

NVOS and HGF may renew the Agreement within two (2) years of the expiry of the initial term upon mutual understanding. 8.2 It is understood that a subsequent renewal of a five (5) year term will be indefinite and automatically renewed unless either party provides written notice of termination one (1) year prior to the end of each five-year term. 8.3 Both parties may enter into buyout negotiations with the other Party on terms agreeable to both Parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the renewal terms. Section 8.1 states a renewal is possible within two years of the expiry of the initial term. Section 8.2 originally stated that a subsequent renewal would be negotiated in good faith. The modified section 8.2 now states that the renewal will be indefinite and automatically renewed unless either party provides written notice. This creates a conflict as the original intent implies negotiation for each renewal period while the modified text suggests automatic renewal unless actively terminated. This leads to uncertainty about the renewal process and the commitment length.",

                "explanation": "This change creates conflicting obligations regarding the remuneration and product purchase. Originally, NVOS was obligated to remunerate HGF 30% of net income and purchase product at cost plus 5%. The modification in Section 9.3 adds a condition that remuneration is subject to NVOS's satisfaction with HGF's performance, giving NVOS discretionary power. Section 9.4 is changed so that NVOS can purchase product at a price determined at their sole discretion. This introduces uncertainty and potential disputes regarding the pricing and payment terms, as the original objective criteria are replaced with subjective assessments.",

Article 3.1 states that 'The parties will work in a Joint Venture relationship with NVOS providing the development and operation of the project including sales and HGF providing the land, farming expertise, biomass and necessary approvals for the development of the agricultural project.' In the event there is an issue with records, there can be ambiguity to who is responsible because both parties are required to contribute to the operation. There is conflicting record preservation obligations between the two (2) years and five (5) years.",

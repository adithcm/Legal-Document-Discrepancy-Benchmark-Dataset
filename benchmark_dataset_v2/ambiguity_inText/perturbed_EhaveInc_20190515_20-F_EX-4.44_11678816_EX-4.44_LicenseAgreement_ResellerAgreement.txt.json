This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity (the \"Term\"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",

This term of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial period of five (5) years (the \"Term\"), which shall be automatically renewed for additional one (1) year terms, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions contained herein.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Term' is now ambiguous. Section 1 defines it as 'in perpetuity', while Section 9 now defines it as 'an initial period of five (5) years'. This creates a contradiction that affects the duration of the agreement and the parties' obligations.",

                "explanation": "In the original text, Ehave could immediately suspend the service if CHT didn't pay. However, the modified text introduces a notice period of 30 business days, making the enforcement of payment terms inconsistent within the agreement.",

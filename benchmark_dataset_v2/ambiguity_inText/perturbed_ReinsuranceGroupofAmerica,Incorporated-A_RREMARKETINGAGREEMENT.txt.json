This contradiction affects the scope of the remarketing process and could lead to disputes about which securities are covered. Also, the original defintion of 'Remarketing Procedures' clearly relates to the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and this Agreement but the new one it is vaguely defined as the generally accepted procedures in the financial industry, without reference to the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and this Agreement, bringing uncertainty on the exact procedures to follow.",

                "explanation": "The original version clearly defines the fees and expenses. In contrast, the modified version introduces several ambiguities that will introduce inconsistency. The original agreement states the Company *shall* pay the remarketing agent, while the modified version says the company *might* pay. The original states exactly how much, but the modified version states a *discretionary fee in an amount that is deemed acceptable*. Furthermore, *the Trust shall be liable for some of the fees and expenses in this Section* contradicts the original version that indicates *The Trust shall not be liable for any fees and expenses in this Section.*",

                "original_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective of such Party under similar circumstances, it being understood and agreed that with respect to the Development or Commercialization of MGAH22 and Products, such efforts shall be similar to those efforts and resources commonly used by a Party for a similar biological or pharmaceutical product owned by it or to which it has rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account efficacy, safety, approved labeling, the competitiveness of alternative products in the marketplace, the patent and other proprietary position of the product, and the likelihood of regulatory approval given the regulatory structure involved.",
                "changed_text": "1.18 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means with respect to the efforts to be expended by a Party with respect to any objective under this Agreement, the minimum effort needed to fulfill any objective under the agreement, regardless of the party's normal practices or the potential success of the activity. The costs associated with these activities are not taken into consideration.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by directly contradicting the standard definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts.' The original definition emphasizes 'good faith efforts' and considers factors like market potential and resources. The modified version reduces this to the 'minimum effort,' regardless of potential success, creating a contradiction in the required level of effort.",

Green Cross further agrees, in determining such amounts, it will use Green Cross' then­current standard procedures and methodology, including Green Cross' then­current standard exchange rate methodology for the translation of foreign currency sales into U.S. Dollars or, in the case of Sublicensees, such similar methodology, consistently applied.",
                "changed_text": "1.69 \"Net Sales\" means the total revenue received by Green Cross, before any deductions, from the sale of the product. No deductions for discounts, rebates, returns, taxes or import costs are allowed, as Net Sales represents the gross income before any expense.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Net Sales' outlines specific deductions, while the modified definition explicitly prohibits these deductions. This creates a direct contradiction, making it unclear how Net Sales should be calculated, affecting royalty payments.",

The modified clause removes the 'undertake all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force majeure circumstances' which takes away any obligation or actions to resolve the event.",

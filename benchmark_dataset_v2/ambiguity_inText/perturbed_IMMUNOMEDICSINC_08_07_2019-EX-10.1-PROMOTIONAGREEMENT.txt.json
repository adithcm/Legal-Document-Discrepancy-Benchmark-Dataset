When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver the presentation described in this definition. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",
                "changed_text": "1.33 \"Detail\" means an in-person presentation of the Product and its uses for any indication, whether approved or unapproved, made by any sales representative, regardless of training level, during a Call to any individual, regardless of whether they are a Health Care Professional in the Territory.  When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver the presentation described in this definition. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",
                "explanation": "The original definition requires a 'Detail' to be consistent with approved uses, delivered by trained reps to HCPs. The modified definition broadens this to include any indication (approved or unapproved), any sales representative and any individual, removing the restrictions and creating a conflict with other sections that specify training and approved uses. This creates uncertainty regarding what constitutes a billable 'Detail' under the agreement.",

Company shall ensure that each Sales Representative: (i) is a full-time employee of Company and a full-time member of its sales force; (ii) possesses skills, training and experience that are consistent with industry standards applicable to the promotion of an oncological pharmaceutical product; (iii) has completed the Product-Specific Training and other sales training described in this Agreement and the Brand Plan and achieved a Passing Score on an examination in accordance with Section 2.2.2(c); and (iv) has become adequately equipped and knowledgeable with respect to the Product, as determined in accordance with Company's then-current standards for sales personnel selling pharmaceutical products in the Territory. No sales representative or other individual may be used by Company to perform in-person presentations of the Product in the Territory unless and until such individual satisfies the conditions described in clauses (i) - (iv) above.",

No specific qualifications beyond these are required.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific qualifications, training, and expertise for Sales Representatives. The changed text significantly lowers these requirements, allowing for contracted third parties with minimal training. This contradicts other sections that emphasize qualified and trained representatives, especially regarding compliance and legal aspects.",

Janssen shall be solely responsible for developing and providing to Company (at Janssen's cost) all promotional materials for use in connection with the Promotion of the Product (the \"Promotional Materials\") and agrees to provide Company with sufficient quantities of the materials based on market demand and expected levels of Detailing efforts. Janssen agrees to consider in good faith Company's feedback in the development of any new promotional materials during the Term. Such Promotional Materials shall comply with all applicable Laws and may include written sales and advertising materials, detail aids, brochures, hand-outs, reprints, booth panels and any other promotional support items. Company shall use only the Promotional Materials provided by Janssen and the Product Label and Insert in its Promotion of the Product in the Territory. Company shall not add any Company Trademark to the Promotional Materials or otherwise alter the Promotional Materials in any way. Company shall not develop or use any other promotional materials in its Promotion of the Product.",

Janssen will provide a basic template and brand guidelines, but Company has full discretion over content and distribution. Company is free to add its own branding or logos to these materials.",
                "explanation": "The original text dictates that Janssen controls all promotional material development and approval. The modified text grants Company the freedom to create and customize promotional materials, including adding its own branding. This contradicts the original agreement, which strictly limits Company to using only Janssen-approved materials and prevents alteration of the branding.",

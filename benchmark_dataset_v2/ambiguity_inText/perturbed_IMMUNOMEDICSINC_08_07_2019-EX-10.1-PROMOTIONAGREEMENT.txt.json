When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver the presentation described in this definition. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",

When used as a verb, \"Detail\" means to deliver the presentation described in this definition. \"Detailing\" shall have a corresponding meaning.",
                "explanation": "The original definition strictly defines \"Detail\" as an in-person presentation excluding reminder details or e-details. The modified definition broadens the term to include any interaction, creating a contradiction. This ambiguity affects how detailing requirements are measured and what activities qualify as fulfilling the contract's obligations.",

At a minimum, Company shall cause its Sales Force to satisfy the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement and, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement and the Minimum Top Target Requirement set forth in Exhibit B in each Detailing Period. Company shall ensure that the Sales Force satisfies the Positioning Requirements set forth in Exhibit B.

The modified definition states that the Company 'will make reasonable efforts to achieve'. Also, in the original version details that did not satisfy positioning requirements are not counted, but on the modified version they are counted. This makes the performance obligations ambiguous.",

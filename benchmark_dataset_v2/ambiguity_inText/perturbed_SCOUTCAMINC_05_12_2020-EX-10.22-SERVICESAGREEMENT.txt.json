                "original_text": "4. Compensation. In consideration of the services to be rendered by Maimon hereunder and for Maimon's service as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will pay Maimon a monthly fee of $1,000 during the Minimum Period, beginning on the Effective Date.",
                "changed_text": "4. Compensation. In consideration of the services to be rendered by Maimon hereunder and for Maimon's service as a director on the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company *may* pay Maimon a monthly fee of $1,000 during the Minimum Period, beginning on the Effective Date. The actual amount and payment schedule will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors at their discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original contract states the compensation as a fixed monthly fee. The modified version introduces uncertainty by using 'may pay' instead of 'will pay' and stating that the Board of Directors will determine the amount and schedule. This contradicts the initial statement and creates ambiguity about the CEO's guaranteed monthly compensation.",

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, always in the sole judgment and decision of the Company, then the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.",

If Maimon should become unable to serve as CEO, or should fail to perform any of the obligations hereunder for any cause including death or disability, the Company shall have the right to terminate this agreement on five days prior written notice. Maimon shall have the right to resign at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. The Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon. However, Maimon's termination due to inability to perform duties requires 60 days written notice.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradictory clause about the notice period for termination due to Maimon's inability to serve. The original states the Company can terminate with five days' notice in such cases, while the added sentence specifies a 60-day notice period for the same situation. This creates confusion and potential disputes regarding the required notice period.",

                "explanation": "The original confidentiality clause broadly defines 'Confidential Information' and restricts its use during and after the agreement. The added sentence introduces an exception, stating that 'generic marketing strategies' are exempt after the Service Term, even if they were previously undisclosed. This creates a contradiction as it's unclear whether specific marketing strategies developed during the agreement are still considered confidential if they can be categorized as 'generic' post-termination. This can lead to disputes over what constitutes a generic marketing strategy and whether certain information should remain confidential.",

For each order, NeuroBo shall be obligated to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in [***] tablets. NeuroBo acknowledges and agrees that certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered shall be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo shall order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in consideration of such quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order shall specify at least (i) the quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the expected delivery date for the API, (iv) the requested delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) the shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Upon receipt of the order from NeuroBo, Dong-A shall promptly acknowledge the receipt of such order. No order shall be binding upon the Parties until agreed in writing by Dong-A and NeuroBo; provided, however, that such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon such agreement, the order shall be deemed to be the \"Firm Order\" which shall be binding and may only be revised by agreement of the Parties in writing. Dong-A shall deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo in accordance with the Firm Order on the shipment terms of [***] manufacturing facility of Dong-A (ICC Incoterms 2010), including the delivery date and place set forth therein, within the later of (i) [***] days after the date of the Firm Order and (ii) [***] days after the date of acceptance by Dong-A of the API.",
                "changed_text": "3.1 NeuroBo shall submit to Dong-A an order for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo no later than [***] days prior to the requested delivery date thereof. For each order, NeuroBo shall endeavor to order the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo in approximately [***] tablets, subject to availability. NeuroBo acknowledges and agrees that certain quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo from each batch ordered may be retained by Dong-A for use in the stability tests and as retention samples, and NeuroBo should consider such quantity to be retained by Dong-A. Each order should specify at least (i) the approximate quantity of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (ii) the desired specifications of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, including the specifics of packaging, (iii) the target delivery date for the API, (iv) the projected delivery date for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo, (v) preferred shipment terms for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo and (vi) the estimated supply price for the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. Upon receipt of the order from NeuroBo, Dong-A will make reasonable efforts to acknowledge the receipt of such order. No order shall be binding upon the Parties until agreed in writing by Dong-A and NeuroBo; provided, however, that such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon such agreement, the order shall be deemed to be a preliminary estimate and may be revised by either party with reasonable justification. Dong-A shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to NeuroBo in accordance with the Firm Order on the shipment terms of [***] manufacturing facility of Dong-A (ICC Incoterms 2010), including the delivery date and place set forth therein, within the later of (i) [***] days after the date of the Firm Order and (ii) [***] days after the date of acceptance by Dong-A of the API.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by making the order quantities and specifications less definite. Originally, NeuroBo *shall* order in specific quantities. Now it is changed to 'endeavor to order approximately' and that it 'should consider', making the order process more flexible and less binding. Moreover, Dong-A 'will make reasonable efforts' instead of 'shall promptly acknowledge'. Furthermore, the 'Firm Order' is now a preliminary estimate, creating a conflict with the later use of 'Firm Order'. This creates uncertainty about whether firm commitment is required on the original amount and specs for product supply.",

                "original_text": "3.3 Within [***] days after receipt of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo hereunder, NeuroBo may, in its discretion, perform a quality control test (the \"Product Test\") in accordance with the methods of the test on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for acceptance (the \"Product Test Methods\"), which shall be separately agreed in writing by and between Dong-A and NeuroBo and attached hereto as Exhibit B, as may be amended by the Parties' agreement in writing from time to time. Dong-A shall provide NeuroBo with all available information and technical assistance necessary for NeuroBo to perform the Product Test expeditiously. If the Product Test indicates that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is deficient in quantity or does not meet the Product Specifications, NeuroBo shall notify Dong-A thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with results of the Product Test. If the quantity is deficient, Dong-A shall immediately ship the sufficient amount of additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo to cover the deficiency. If Dong-A does not agree that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, the Parties shall refer their disagreement for decision by an independent testing laboratory agreed by the Parties. The decision by the independent testing laboratory shall be conclusive and binding on both Parties, and the losing Party shall bear the costs of the independent testing laboratory. If Dong-A agrees that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, or if the decision by the testing laboratory confirms that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo does not meet the Product Specifications, (i) Dong-A shall arrange for the return from NeuroBo of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at Dong-A's expense, and (ii) without waiting for the return, Dong-A shall promptly replace the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo at no additional cost to NeuroBo.",
                "changed_text": "3.3 Within [***] days after receipt of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo hereunder, NeuroBo is encouraged to perform a quality control test (the \"Product Test\") based on general industry standards on such Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo for informational purposes only. Exhibit B provides suggested test methods. NeuroBo shall make reasonable effort to inform Dong-A with available information to perform the Product Test. If NeuroBo believes that the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo is potentially deficient in quantity or may not fully meet the Product Specifications, NeuroBo may notify Dong-A thereof in writing within the [***]-day period together with summary results of their assessment. If the quantity is possibly deficient, Dong-A will consider shipping additional Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo. If Dong-A disagrees with Neurobo, then Dong-A will re-evaluate the batch and reserves the right to determine final decision on the product specifications.",
                "explanation": "Here, the obligation to perform a product test is downgraded to a suggestion to do one for informational purposes, creating ambiguity and undermining the seriousness of acceptance criteria. The definite Product Test Methods is replaced with general industry standards. Notification only occurs if NeuroBo *believes* something is *potentially* wrong rather than a clear determination of a deficiency. Dong-A only 'will consider shipping' replacements rather than 'shall immediately ship', and Dong-A has ultimate decision power even when NeuroBo has issues. This weakens the requirement for product quality and allows for disputes, conflicting with the original intent.",

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Dong-A, NeuroBo shall pay the invoiced supply price (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount shall correspond the invoiced amount converted from KRW to USD at the exchange rate of the payment date, no later than [***] days prior to the shipment date by way of wire transfer to Dong-A. NeuroBo shall be responsible for and pay all wire transfer fees incurred in the Territory. If Dong-A does not receive payment of any sum due to it on or before the due date, [***] interest shall thereafter accrue on the sum due to until the date of payment at the [***] rate of [***] percent ([***]%) over the then-current prime rate quoted by Citibank in New York, New York or the maximum rate allowable by New York law, whichever is lower.",
                "changed_text": "4.3 Following the issuance of what the parties understand as a Firm Order, Dong-A intends to issue to NeuroBo an invoice in Korean Won for each shipment of the Licensed Products and/or their matching placebo that reflects the original agreed-upon estimate. Unless a different agreement is reached in writing, NeuroBo should make a good faith effort to pay approximately the invoiced amount either (i) in Korean Won (KRW) or (ii) in United States Dollars (USD) which amount represents a general conversion from KRW to USD using a recently available exchange rate, around [***] days prior to the anticipated shipment date through a method that is mutually convenient. NeuroBo will take measures to manage wire transfer fees incurred in the Territory. If Dong-A finds itself without the expected funds in the account near the specified payment timing, Dong-A and NeuroBo will work together to resolve the matter.",
                "explanation": "The original text is very prescriptive, with clear payment obligations. The revised text introduces uncertainty. 'Following the issuance of what the parties understand as a Firm Order' weakens the Firm Order definition. 'Dong-A intends to issue an invoice' instead of 'shall issue' is less obligatory. NeuroBo 'should make a good faith effort' instead of 'shall pay'. The use of 'approximately' and 'general conversion' further reduces the commitment to exact payment. The consequences for late payment are also removed. And the 'Firm Order' again is being brought into questions as previously specified in 3.1 where it is now a 'preliminary estimate'.",

Talent represents and warrants that he has not granted nor will he grant to any other party any right, permission, or license to use the Property in connection with the advertisement,  sale, or promotion of the Product or in connection with products that are identical or substantially similar to the Product.",

Talent represents and warrants that he has not granted any exclusive right to any other party to use the Property in connection with the direct sale of the Product, but reserves the right to grant non-exclusive licenses for promotional activities related to similar products.",
                "explanation": "Original text says Talent cannot grant rights to others for identical products. The changed text states that Talent can grant non-exclusive rights for similar products, creating a contradiction on scope of product exclusivity.",

The period of license granted shall be for the Term and shall extend for a period of twenty four (24) months or until terminated as per clause 8 herein. It is agreed that the Term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties.",
                "changed_text": "3. TERM\n\nThis Agreement shall be effective as of the date of execution by both parties. The period of license granted shall be for the Term, defined in section 1 as ending December 31, 2013, and may also be extended for a period of twenty four (24) months or until terminated as per clause 8 herein. The extension is automatic unless either party provides written notice of termination 30 days prior to December 31, 2013.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a term and a potential extension via mutual agreement. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating an initial end date and also a 24-month extension, with conflicting instructions for how the extension occurs (automatic unless notice is provided). The agreement in section 1 mentions 1.5t January 2013 to 315t December 2013 which is less than 24 months mentioned in section 3, creating internal contradiction and uncertainty.",

Talent shall not make any request for unreasonable revisions and shall not withhold consent for any proposed use of the Property unreasonably.\n\ne. In the event that Talent does not provide either written approval of materials or a written request for revisions of such materials containing a proposed use of the Property within ten (10) days following Company's submission of such materials to Talent for review, such non-response shall automatically be deemed to be an acceptance and approval of the proposed use of the Property.",

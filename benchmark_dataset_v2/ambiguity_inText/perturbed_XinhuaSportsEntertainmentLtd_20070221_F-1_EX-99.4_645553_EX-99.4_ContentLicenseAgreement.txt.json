This change introduces ambiguity by changing 'for a consideration to be mutually agreed.' to 'at no additional consideration'.

Further, Clause 8.3b originally stated with interest but now, without interest. The two edits make it unclear as to the timeline in which the CEIS should stop transmission and whether it is necessary to pay back XFN with interest.",

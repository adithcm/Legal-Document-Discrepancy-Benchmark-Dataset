                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned. Subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G may be filed individually, reflecting only the changes relevant to each individual filer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity. The original text clearly states that all amendments are filed jointly. The modified text suggests that amendments can be filed individually, creating a contradiction regarding the filing responsibility and potentially leading to disputes over who is responsible for what information within those amendments. This contradiction undermines the initial agreement for joint filing.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, but shall not be responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the others, except to the extent that he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall strive to ensure the timely filing of such amendments and will endeavor to provide complete and accurate information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, and shall not be responsible for the information concerning the others, regardless of whether he or it knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the responsibility for timely filing and accuracy. 'Shall be responsible' is replaced with 'shall strive to ensure', making the obligation less binding. Additionally, removing the exception regarding knowledge of inaccurate information further limits liability and could lead to disputes over accountability if inaccurate information is filed without consequences, directly contradicting the original strict liability.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces uncertainty about the authority and responsibility of Thomas Sipp across different entities. By stating that the title 'Varies by Entity', it creates a question of whether Sipp's role and authority is consistent across all the entities signing the agreement, or whether he is acting in different capacities with varying levels of responsibility. This directly contradicts the implied assumption that he has a consistent and defined role, potentially leading to legal disputes about which capacity he was acting in at any given time.",

                "original_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned and that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned without the necessity of filing additional joint acquisition statements.",
                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge and agree that the foregoing statement on this Schedule 13G is filed on behalf of each of the undersigned. It is suggested, but not required, that all subsequent amendments to this statement on Schedule 13G shall be filed on behalf of each of the undersigned.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that amendments will be filed, implying a mandatory action. The modified text introduces uncertainty by suggesting the amendments are not required, which introduces ambiguity and makes the enforcement of future filings unclear.",

                "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each shall be responsible for making a good faith effort towards the timely filing of such amendments and for the general accuracy of the information concerning him or it contained herein or therein, and shall only be held responsible if information concerning the others is intentionally falsified, demonstrating malicious intent.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states responsibility for timely filing and accuracy. The changed text weakens this by requiring only a 'good faith effort' for timely filing and 'general accuracy,' and raising the bar for responsibility regarding others' information to intentional falsification ('malicious intent'). This creates uncertainty about the required level of diligence and introduces subjective criteria for accountability.",

                "explanation": "The addition of '(Acknowledged but not legally bound)' next to one signatory's name creates a contradiction. While all signatories are presumably bound by the agreement, this addition implies one might not be, introducing ambiguity and potential legal challenges to that signatory's obligations.",

                "original_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means, in the case of nanomaterials and coated nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 54 kilograms or less, and, in the case of dispersions of nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 60 kilograms or less.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 \"Research Quantities\" means, in the case of nanomaterials, quantities purchased and distributed in individual orders of 54 kilograms or less. For coated nanomaterials and dispersions of nanomaterials, Research Quantities are defined as any amount deemed reasonable by ALFA AESAR for research purposes.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Research Quantities.' Initially, a clear quantity limit was set for all nanomaterials. The modified version makes the quantity limit for coated nanomaterials and dispersions subjective ('any amount deemed reasonable by ALFA AESAR'), creating ambiguity and a conflict with the first part of the sentence.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces a contradiction regarding the timeframe within which ALFA AESAR can seek alternative sourcing if NTC fails to fulfill an order. Originally, this period was thirty (30) days, however, it is now stipulated to be sixty (60) days. This inconsistency could create confusion regarding what happens to a 30-day unfulfilled order.",

Subject to the protocol in Section 5.1, ALFA AESAR may return to NTC any Product that is defective or that fails to comply with the purchase order provided by ALFA AESAR. NTC shall return to ALFA AESAR as promptly as possible, a working replacement or, in the event such replacement is not possible or at ALFA AESAR's election, it shall credit ALFA AESAR's account for the invoiced price and shipping charges of the defective Product. The 6 correction of such defective Product shall be at no cost to ALFA AESAR. The cost of shipping the replacement Product back to ALFA AESAR shall be paid by NTC.

Subject to the protocol in Section 5.1, ALFA AESAR may return to NTC any Product that is defective or that fails to comply with the purchase order provided by ALFA AESAR. NTC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to return to ALFA AESAR as promptly as possible, a working replacement or, in the event such replacement is not possible or at ALFA AESAR's election, it shall credit ALFA AESAR's account for the invoiced price and shipping charges of the defective Product. The correction of such defective Product shall be at a cost to be determined upon mutual agreement by both parties.

                "explanation": "This perturbation undermines the 'Sole and Exclusive Remedy' clause and introduces ambiguity around cost. Replacing 'NTC shall return' with 'NTC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to return', adding 'at a cost to be determined upon mutual agreement', stating that shipping costs are subject to negotiation, and changing 'shall constitute' to 'may constitute' directly opposes the original meaning. The uncertainty and possible negotiation over the solution for returns could cause disputes.",

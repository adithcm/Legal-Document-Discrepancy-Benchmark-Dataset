                "explanation": "The definitions of \"Research Quantities\" and \"Commercial Quantities\" are now conflicting. Initially, the thresholds were 54kg/60kg for nanomaterials/dispersions respectively. This modification changes the commercial quantities definition to greater than 50kg/55kg for nanomaterials/dispersions respectively. This creates a contradiction: an order of 52kg of nanomaterials could be argued as either research or commercial quantities, depending on which definition is referenced, thus creating uncertainty about the applicable pricing, distribution rights and other obligations.",

In the event that ALFA AESAR believes that it is entitled to return any Products delivered under this Agreement, the parties will adhere to the following protocol: (w) ALFA AESAR will contact NTC's Quality Director and then forward to the Quality Director, via a carrier selected by and at NTC's expense, a sample of the Product that ALFA AESAR believes is non-conforming; (x) upon receipt of the sample, NTC will test it and then notify ALFA AESAR of the test results; (y) where the test results confirm that the sample is non-conforming, NTC will provide ALFA AESAR with NTC's Return Authorization Number (\"RAN\"); and (z) any returned non-conforming Product must be in its original container, with original labels in act, and all paperwork concerning the returned Product must include NTC's RAN.",

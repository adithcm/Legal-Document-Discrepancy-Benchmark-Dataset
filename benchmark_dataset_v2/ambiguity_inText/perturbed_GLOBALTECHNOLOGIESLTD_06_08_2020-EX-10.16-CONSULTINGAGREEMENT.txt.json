                "original_text": "This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",

Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days notice, and the effective date of termination shall be thirty (30) days from when such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the agreement lasts for one year or until services are complete, then allows termination with immediate notice. The modified version removes the 'until services are completed' clause, making the one-year term absolute. Then introduces termination with 30 days notice, conflicting with the immediate termination clause for bankruptcy or insolvency. This creates ambiguity about when and how the contract can be terminated, especially if services are completed before the one-year mark.",

Consultant is not responsible for the performance of any services that may be rendered hereunder if the Company fails to provide the requested information in writing prior thereto. The services of Consultant shall not include the rendering of any legal opinions or the performance of any work that is in the ordinary purview of a certified public accountant. Consultant cannot guarantee results on behalf of the Company but shall use commercially reasonable efforts in providing the services listed above. Consultant's duty is to identify prospective acquisition/joint venture companies for the Company. Consultant will in no way act as a \"broker-dealer\" under state securities laws. Because all final decisions pertaining to any particular investment are to be made by the Company, the Company may be required to communicate directly with potential acquisition/joint venture prospective companies.",

                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original by stating the consultant IS responsible for services even without information, WILL provide legal opinions/accounting work, and DOES guarantee results. This creates significant legal risk and ambiguity regarding the consultant's obligations and liabilities.",

                "explanation": "This change flips the entire non-circumvention clause. Originally the company agreed not to use the Consultant's opportunities without their involvement. The modified text states they *can* freely use the information (contradicting the confidentiality agreement) but then oddly retains the requirement for Consultant's approval *if* doing so outside their direct involvement. This creates a contradiction; if the information isn't confidential and can be freely used, why would approval still be needed under certain circumstances?",

                "explanation": "The original definition of FG Acquired Patents is broad, covering all patents acquired by FG. The changed definition limits it to those patents acquired for use in the Astellas Territory, potentially excluding patents relevant to FG's own development efforts. The original definition of FG Development Program is related to commercialization in the Astellas Territory. The changed definition includes all activities globally, creating contradiction between both definitions and creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

In addition to, but not in limitation of, the foregoing, FG and Astellas agree that upon Marketing Approval for any Lead Compound, FG's obligation to supply Astellas with Lead Compound shall be limited to, and all payment obligations set forth in Section 9.2 shall be based on, the supply of Bulk Product, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The packaging for the Lead Compound to be distributed commercially by Astellas shall contain a clearly visible acknowledgment that the Lead Compound was manufactured by FG, and shall contain a registered trademark of the FG logo or other trademark approved by FG.",

The Lead Compounds to be supplied by FG hereunder should generally conform to mutually agreed upon, but not strictly binding, Product Specifications. In addition to, but not in limitation of, the foregoing, FG and Astellas agree that upon Marketing Approval for any Lead Compound, FG's obligation to supply Astellas with Lead Compound shall include the supply of finished, retail-ready product, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The packaging for the Lead Compound to be distributed commercially by Astellas may, at Astellas's sole discretion, contain an acknowledgment that the Lead Compound was manufactured by FG.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies that Lead Compounds *shall* meet the Product Specifications and mandates a visible acknowledgment of FG's manufacturing on the packaging. The modified clause weakens the adherence to specifications by using 'should generally conform' and makes the acknowledgment discretionary. The original mentions FG's obligation to supply Astellas with the supply of Bulk Product while the change mentions that obligation would include supply of finished, retail-ready product. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes over the required level of compliance and branding.",

FG may forthwith terminate this Agreement in the event Astellas fails to make any payment due under Articles 6, 9 or 14, within [ * ] following receipt of written notice of such default, or materially breaches its obligations under Articles 8 or 14, and fails to cure such breach within [ * ] following receipt of written notice of such default. Astellas may forthwith terminate this Agreement in the event FG materially breaches its obligations under Article 7 or Article 12, and fails to cure such breach within [ * ] following receipt of written notice of such default. Any termination shall become effective at the end of such [ * ] or [ * ] period unless the defaulting or breaching party (or any other party on its behalf) has cured any such default prior to the expiration of the [ * ] or [ * ] period, as the case may be.",
                "changed_text": "18.2.1 Material Breaches. FG may terminate this Agreement if Astellas is perceived to have not made any payment due under Articles 6, 9 or 14, within [ * ] of the date the invoice was sent, or if Astellas does not seem to fulfill its obligations under Articles 8 or 14, without the need for written notice or a cure period. Astellas may terminate this Agreement if FG appears to have breached its obligations under Article 7 or Article 12, without the need for written notice or a cure period. Any termination will be considered final upon FG's declaration, irrespective of whether a formal breach occurred or if rectification is possible.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires a material breach, written notice, and a cure period before termination can occur. The modified clause introduces a subjective element ('perceived', 'seems to fulfill') and eliminates the requirement for written notice and a cure period. This makes the termination process arbitrary and creates uncertainty as there are no objective standards for determining a breach. This introduces contradiction and ambiguity.",

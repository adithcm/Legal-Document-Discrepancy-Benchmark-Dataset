Any Lead Compound which receives a Marketing Approval in the Astellas Territory shall remain a Lead Compound for the duration of such Marketing Approval. As of the Effective Date, FG-2216 shall be deemed to be a Lead Compound.",

A Lead Compound which receives a Marketing Approval in the Astellas Territory shall cease to be a Lead Compound immediately following such Marketing Approval. As of the Effective Date, FG-2216 shall be deemed to be a Lead Compound.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Lead Compound' is altered so that after Marketing Approval, it ceases to be a Lead Compound, conflicting with the original text. This creates ambiguity regarding the status and associated rights/obligations of a compound after it has received Marketing Approval. This could affect the terms related to payments, manufacturing, and other aspects defined in relation to Lead Compounds.",

The modified text removes this statement, indicating there is no guarantee that the compound will be manufactured in accordance with the GMP guidelines. This creates a conflict about the guaranteed quality of the supplied Lead Compounds. It is not clear if meeting the GMP guidelines is important or not.",

The change also limits clinical trials (including Phase I and Phase II). This might affect liability, termination options, and expected performance levels.",

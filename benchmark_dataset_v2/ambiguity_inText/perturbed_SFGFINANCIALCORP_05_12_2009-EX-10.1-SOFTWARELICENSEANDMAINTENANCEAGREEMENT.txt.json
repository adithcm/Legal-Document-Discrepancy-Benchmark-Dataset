                "explanation": "This creates conflicting terms of payment for technical support. Section (a) introduces a new charge for support over 10 hours whereas Section (d) stated that all fees are set forth above, so by introducing an additional payment in (a) is contradicts the 'no additional fees' without further writing, thus in turn making the language ambiguous.",

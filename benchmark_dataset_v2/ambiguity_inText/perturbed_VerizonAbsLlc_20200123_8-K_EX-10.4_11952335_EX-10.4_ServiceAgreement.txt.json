In addition, the Servicer may waive late payment charges or other fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing a Receivable. The Servicer may grant extensions, refunds, rebates or adjustments on any Receivable or amend any Receivable according to the Servicing Procedures. However, if the Servicer (i) grants payment extensions resulting in the final payment date of the Receivable being later than the Collection Period immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the latest maturing Class of Notes, (ii) cancels a Receivable or reduces or waives (including with respect to any Upgrade Offer) the remaining Principal Balance under a Receivable or any portion thereof and/or as a result, the monthly payments due thereunder, or (iii) modifies, supplements, amends or revises a Receivable to grant the Obligor under such Receivable a contractual right to upgrade the related Device, it will acquire the affected Receivable solely as described under Section 3.3, unless it is required to take the action by Law. In addition, if the Marketing Agent or the Servicer (x) applies a payment or grants a credit to an Obligor with respect to cancellations, prepayments or invoicing errors the Servicer may apply such credits either directly to the applicable device payment plan agreement or in accordance with its customary payment application procedures set forth above and (y) applies a payment or grants a credit to an Obligor under a Receivable in connection with an Upgrade Offer as set forth in Section 3.12(b), the Servicer will apply such credits directly to the applicable device payment plan agreement and will not apply such credits in accordance with its customary payment application procedures set forth above.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces ambiguities by replacing 'may be changed at any time' with 'must never be changed', 'may waive' with 'must never waive', 'may grant' with 'can not grant' and 'will acquire' with 'may or may not acquire' creating internal contradictions if another part of the contract enforces the opposite. This creates an in-text contradiction on how the Servicer should act when servicing the receivables. The meaning of the requirements became unclear and allow multiple interpretations, and the enforcement of the requirements can not be consistent.",

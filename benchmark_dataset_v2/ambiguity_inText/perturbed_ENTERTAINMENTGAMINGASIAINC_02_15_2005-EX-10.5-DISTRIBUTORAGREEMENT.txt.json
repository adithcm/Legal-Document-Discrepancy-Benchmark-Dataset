Distributor shall not obtain, purchase, receive or source any other card shuffling machine from any third party or other source under any circumstance other than from Vendor with the exception of all Shuffle Master, Inc. shuffling machines which are held in stock at the Effective Date which Distributor is free to sell, rent purchase or lease until all of the said stock has been depleted.",

Distributor shall not obtain, purchase, receive or source any other card shuffling machine from any third party or other source under any circumstance other than from Vendor. Distributor may obtain, purchase, receive or source any other card shuffling machine from any third party or other source under any circumstance other than from Vendor with the exception of all Shuffle Master, Inc. shuffling machines which are held in stock at the Effective Date which Distributor is free to sell, rent purchase or lease until all of the said stock has been depleted.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the Distributor's ability to source card shuffling machines. The initial clause forbids sourcing from anywhere except Vendor, but the added clause creates a contradiction by appearing to allow sourcing from third parties under certain circumstances, creating an in-text contradiction, which then creates uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'agrees to purchase' with 'agrees to use its best commercial efforts to purchase', making performance non-binding. Furthermore, shifting the 'fit for purpose' determination from Distributor to Vendor creates an internal contradiction, if another part of the contract enforces strict adherence to Distributor's specifications, which leads to potential legal disputes over meaning.",

                "original_text": "In consideration of the Agents' services to be rendered in connection with the Offering, the Corporation shall pay to the Agents a cash fee (the \"Agents' Fee\") equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. As additional consideration, the Corporation shall issue to the Agents that number of compensation options (the \"Compensation Options\") equal to 3.5% of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering. The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 24 months at the Offering Price. Unless otherwise stated herein, the Offered Shares shall also refer to the Compensation Options. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the entire Agents' Fee and Compensation Options payable in respect of Offered Shares sold pursuant to Regulation D under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shall be payable to the Lead Agent. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Agents severally and not jointly agree to act as, and the Corporation appoints the Agents as, the exclusive agents of the Corporation to offer the Offered Shares for sale on the Closing Date (as defined herein) in the Selling Jurisdictions (as defined herein) on a private placement basis at the Offering Price.",
                "changed_text": "In consideration of the Agents' services to be rendered in connection with the Offering, the Corporation may pay to the Agents a cash fee (the \"Agents' Fee\") as determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors, but the fee will not exceed 7.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering. As additional consideration, the Corporation may issue to the Agents that number of compensation options (the \"Compensation Options\") equal to a percentage, decided at the discretion of the Corporation, of the number of Offered Shares sold pursuant to the Offering. The Compensation Options will be exercisable for a period of 24 months, or such other period as determined by the Corporation, at the Offering Price. Unless otherwise stated herein, the Offered Shares may refer to the Compensation Options, at the Corporation's discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Agents' Fee and Compensation Options payable in respect of Offered Shares sold pursuant to Regulation D under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be payable to any of the Agents, as determined by the Corporation.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed percentage for the Agents' Fee and Compensation Options. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating that the fee 'may' be paid and its amount is 'determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors,' and the Offered shares 'may' refer to the compensation options at the Corporation's discretion, creating uncertainty regarding the agents' compensation and Offered Shares obligations.",

                "explanation": "Originally, 'Closing' clearly defines the completion of the offering. The modification now allows for a potential completion of *part* of the offering and changes to be at the 'Corporation's discretion', conflicting the definition. The original text provides a specific time. The modified version introduces uncertainty about which date applies and if the closing will happen, thereby creating an internal contradiction.",

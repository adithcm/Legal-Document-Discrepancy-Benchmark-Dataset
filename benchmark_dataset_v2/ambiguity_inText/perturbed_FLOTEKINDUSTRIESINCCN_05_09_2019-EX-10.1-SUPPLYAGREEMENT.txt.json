                "original_text": "Shipments of Terpene Product to Flotek must be made by FCC from FCC's facility within three (3) days of the date of the applicable purchase order. Delivery terms shall be FOB Winter Haven, Florida. Transportation shall be arranged by Flotek. All sales of Terpene Product subject to this Agreement shall be pursuant to the terms and conditions attached hereto as Exhibit B.",
                "changed_text": "Shipments of Terpene Product to Flotek should be made by FCC from FCC's facility within five (5) business days of the date of the applicable purchase order, unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing. Delivery terms shall be FOB Winter Haven, Florida. Transportation may be arranged by either Flotek or FCC, depending on the mutual convenience and agreement of both parties. All sales of Terpene Product subject to this Agreement shall be pursuant to some of the terms and conditions attached hereto as Exhibit B.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates shipments within three days and Flotek arranging transportation. The modified text changes this to 'should' allowing more leeway with a 5-day period, introduces the possibility of mutually agreed alternative delivery dates, and either party handling the transportation. This conflicts with the strict deadlines and responsibilities initially defined and also says that only some of the terms and conditions in Exhibit B will apply.",

                "changed_text": "FCC warrants to Flotek that:\n\n(a) most of the Terpene Product supplied by FCC to Flotek may:\n\n(i) conform to the general specifications referenced in Section 1;\n\n(ii) comply with general laws and regulations including, laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which the Terpene Product are either manufactured or to be sold or used concerning purity, sanitation, safety, security, and packaging and labeling of food and beverage;\n\n(iii) be in acceptable condition at the time of delivery; and\n\n(iv) be free from any significant defect in design, workmanship, materials and packaging;\n\n(b) it shall convey to Flotek questionable title to the Terpene Product free of significant encumbrance, lien or security interest;",
                "explanation": "This modifies the warranty clause, weakening the guarantees made by FCC. 'All' becomes 'most', 'shall' becomes 'may' and 'conform to the specifications set forth in Section 1' becomes 'conform to the general specifications referenced in Section 1'. 'Good' condition changes to 'acceptable' condition and 'free from any defect' becomes 'free from any significant defect'. The original warranty offers strong assurance, while the modified version introduces uncertainty about the quality and compliance of the Terpene Product. By also using the word 'questionable' in the title transfer, there is now an area of concern that does not have good standing.",

FCC shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) days after the date of such purchase order, confirm its acceptance or rejection of such purchase order by written notice to Flotek. FCC shall be obligated to accept all such purchase orders unless the amount ordered for a Year exceeds the Maximum Quantity, or orders for a particular quarter exceed [***] pounds or exceed the Flotek forecast for that quarter by more than 25%, provided, however, that, in such event, FCC shall communicate Flotek of the time period that will be required to satisfy such order assuming FCC endeavors to satisfy such order as soon as practicable, and Flotek shall inform FCC within ten (10) days of such communication whether it will order such Terpene Product pursuant to the revised delivery terms.",
                "changed_text": "Flotek may order Terpene Product by sending to FCC purchase orders that are similar to the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. FCC will try to confirm its acceptance or rejection of such purchase order by written notice to Flotek. FCC may not be obligated to accept all such purchase orders even if the amount ordered for a Year does not exceed the Maximum Quantity, or orders for a particular quarter exceed [***] pounds or exceed the Flotek forecast for that quarter by more than 25%, and in such event, FCC might communicate Flotek of the time period that will be required to satisfy such order assuming FCC attempts to satisfy such order, and Flotek could inform FCC whether it will order such Terpene Product pursuant to the revised delivery terms.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Flotek 'shall' order using the form in Exhibit A, and FCC 'shall' confirm within three days, and 'shall be obligated' to accept orders within quantity limits. The revised version makes these actions optional: 'may' order, 'will try' to confirm, and 'may not be obligated'. This introduces significant ambiguity about the ordering process and FCC's obligations to fulfill orders, contradicting the initial clarity.",

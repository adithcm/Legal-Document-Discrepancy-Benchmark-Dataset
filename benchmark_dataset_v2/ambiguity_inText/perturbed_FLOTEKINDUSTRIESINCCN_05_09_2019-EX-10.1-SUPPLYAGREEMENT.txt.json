                "explanation": "The original text states FCC 'will maintain' adequate capacity, creating an obligation. The modified text says FCC 'will attempt to maintain,' making the capacity obligation non-binding. This creates uncertainty about FCC's responsibility to consistently supply Terpene Product, potentially impacting Flotek's operations.",

All sales of Terpene Product subject to this Agreement shall be pursuant to the terms and conditions attached hereto as Exhibit B.",
                "explanation": "The original text says 'must be made within three (3) days', and the modified version says 'should be made within five (5) business days'. This creates ambiguity around the strictness of the shipping timeline. While the original says the shipping MUST be done within the time frame, the changed version says the shipping SHOULD be done, creating a contradiction between the two sections.",

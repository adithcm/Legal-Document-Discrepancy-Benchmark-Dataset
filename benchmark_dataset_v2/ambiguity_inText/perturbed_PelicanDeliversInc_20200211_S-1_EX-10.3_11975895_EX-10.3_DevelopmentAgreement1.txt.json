                "explanation": "The original text specifies the payment schedule as tied to the start of the project and completion of specific milestones. The modified text changes the first payment to 'within 30 days of the start of the project', and the second to 'substantial completion...as determined by the Developer'. This introduces ambiguity around when the first two payments are due, as 'substantial completion' is subjective and 'within 30 days' gives a range.",

The modified text changes 'will tie into' to 'will attempt to tie into', making the connection optional.

The modified text inserts 'when feasible', making the ID scan conditional, and adds 'if successful', meaning that even if scanned it may not be considered completed.

Assuming the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) above are met, Proprietary Information includes information, without regard to form, including, but not limited to, technical and nontechnical data, databases, formulas, patterns, designs, compilations, computer programs and software, devices, inventions, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, lists of actual or potential customers and suppliers (which are not commonly known by or available to the public), research, development, and existing and future products.",
                "changed_text": "(pp) \"Proprietary Information\" means only that information which is both explicitly marked as proprietary at the time of disclosure and which is independently protectable under applicable trade secret law. For the avoidance of doubt, information which is merely treated as confidential or which derives economic value from its non-public status shall not be considered Proprietary Information unless it is also explicitly marked as such.",
                "explanation": "The original definition includes a broad range of information treated as confidential, whereas the modified definition requires explicit marking and independent protectability under trade secret law, substantially narrowing the scope of what constitutes 'Proprietary Information.'

The modified definition limits the transferred assets to only tangible items and excludes intellectual property, which creates a contradiction in subsequent sections referring to 'Transferred Assets' related to IP.",

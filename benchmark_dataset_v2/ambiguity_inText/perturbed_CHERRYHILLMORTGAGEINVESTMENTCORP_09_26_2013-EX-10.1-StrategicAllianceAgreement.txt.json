                "original_text": "Base Servicing Fee: As to any Mortgage Loan and any Collection Period, an amount equal to the product of the Base Servicing Fee Rate, the UPB of that Mortgage Loan as of the related Measurement Date and 1/12 or, for the first Collection Period, the number of days in such Collection Period divided by 360; provided, however, that payment of the Base Servicing Fee for any delinquent Mortgage Loan shall be suspended unless and until Freedom Mortgage recovers the amount thereof from payments in respect thereof from the related mortgagor or the amount thereof is otherwise recovered from liquidation of the related property.",
                "changed_text": "Base Servicing Fee: As to any Mortgage Loan and any Collection Period, an amount equal to the product of the Base Servicing Fee Rate, the UPB of that Mortgage Loan as of the related Measurement Date and 1/12 or, for the first Collection Period, the number of days in such Collection Period divided by 360. Payment of the Base Servicing Fee for any delinquent Mortgage Loan will continue uninterrupted, regardless of recovery from the mortgagor or liquidation of the property.",
                "explanation": "The original definition suspends the Base Servicing Fee for delinquent Mortgage Loans until recovery. The modified definition states that the fee continues uninterrupted, creating a direct contradiction about the payment terms for delinquent loans and therefore, uncertainty in the application of fees.",

A decrease in stock price of 10% or more shall be considered a Material Adverse Effect.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of Material Adverse Effect (MAE) is broad and subjective, focusing on the ability to consummate transactions or perform obligations. The modified definition adds a specific, objective trigger (10% stock price decrease) and tightens the subjective criterion by focusing on the financial standing of the named party. This creates conflict, as an event could be an MAE under the stock price trigger, even if it doesn't impede the party's ability to perform obligations in general, or may require financial standing to be affected in order to be considered a Material Adverse Effect.",

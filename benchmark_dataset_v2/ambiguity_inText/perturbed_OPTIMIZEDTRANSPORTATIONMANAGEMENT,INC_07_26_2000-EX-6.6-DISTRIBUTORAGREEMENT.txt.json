                "explanation": "The original definition limits the exclusive territory to the 48 contiguous states. The modified definition expands the territory to include all 50 states. This creates ambiguity regarding the distributor's rights and responsibilities in Hawaii and Alaska, potentially leading to disputes over sales and marketing activities in those states.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty period is 3 years, which provides a significant assurance of product quality and reliability. By decreasing the warranty to 1 year, that is a contradition of the original warranty period. This difference can lead to disputes regarding the extent of ITS's liability for defective products and the duration of support provided.",

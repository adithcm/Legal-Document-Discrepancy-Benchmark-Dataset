Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'control' is broad, encompassing the power to direct management and policies through various means, including contractual agreements. The modified definition restricts 'control' solely to the ownership of more than 50% of voting securities. This creates a contradiction because a Seller could exert 'control' under the original definition (e.g., through a contractual arrangement) but not under the modified definition, leading to uncertainty regarding the scope of the non-compete clause.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",

                "explanation": "The original clause (2) states that a 'general solicitation' does NOT allow the sellers to hire employees of the combined business during the non-solicit period. The modified clause (2) now states that a 'general solicitation' DOES allow the sellers to hire such employees during the non-solicit period. This creates a direct contradiction about whether or not the sellers can hire employees solicited via a 'general solicitation' during the non-solicit period, making the non-solicitation clause ambiguous.",

                "explanation": "The original text indicates that consent to assignment 'shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.' The changed text removes the 'or delayed' portion. This now introduces ambiguity. While it still says the consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, what happens if the consent is reasonably withheld, but unreasonably delayed? The original intent makes the contract clear that this is disallowed but now it's not so clear. What would happen in a situation where it is argued that delaying consent is a constructive denial of the ability to assign? It could open up legal disputes over whether the delay was justified and whether the withholding of consent, even if ultimately given, caused damages.",

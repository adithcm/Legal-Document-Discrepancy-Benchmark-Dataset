                "original_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.",
                "changed_text": "For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting securities of a Person. Control can only be established through equity ownership.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of 'control'. The original definition is broad, encompassing influence through voting securities, contract, or otherwise. The modified definition restricts 'control' solely to equity ownership exceeding 50%, contradicting the original expansive definition. This will create uncertainty in determining if a party has 'control' if they influence management through means other than majority equity ownership, potentially impacting the non-compete provisions.",

Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former 3 employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.",
                "changed_text": "Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any key employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the key employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former 3 employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period. For purposes of this section, 'key employee' refers to employees at the executive level only.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in the definition of which employees are covered by the non-solicitation clause. Initially, it covered all employees. The modification limits the scope to 'key employees' but then further defines 'key employees' at the end of the paragraph as 'employees at the executive level only.' This creates a potential contradiction and ambiguity. Other sections of the agreement refer to employees generally. If another section gives all employees access to confidential information, then this definition conflicts. It is unclear whether the non-solicitation agreement applies to all employees with confidential information, or only executive level employees.",

However, no party is obligated to take any action that would result in significant financial loss to that party.",
                "explanation": "This change adds an exception to the cooperation clause. The original clause mandates parties to take actions to fulfill the agreement. The modified clause introduces a condition that allows a party to refuse action if it results in 'significant financial loss.' However, 'significant financial loss' is not defined, creating ambiguity and a contradiction because some sections may require actions that result in financial loss, therefore one party may feel that they are not obligated to do what is required in other sections. What one party considers 'significant' another may not.",

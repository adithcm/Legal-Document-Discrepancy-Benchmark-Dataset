The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies.",

The equity trading desks shall endeavor to execute buy and sell orders based on instructions provided by affiliated advisers. While the trading staff may place orders electronically or contact brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels, there is no guarantee orders will be filled. Upon what the transaction settlement group deems a 'suitable' completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to facilitate exchange of securities and monies.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the trading desks 'execute' orders, implying a mandatory action. The modified text uses 'shall endeavor' and introduces uncertainty about order fulfillment and what is deemed 'suitable' completion. This creates a contradiction because the original language suggests a guaranteed outcome while the changed text does not.",

Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser.",

Analysis may include review of reports, but is not required. Interviews of company management, on-site observation of operations, and financial models are optional. Analysts may read trade journals and attend industry conferences, but their attendance is at their discretion. Based on analysis, the analyst may make buy, sell or hold recommendations, but are not obligated to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original text implies that analysts are expected to perform comprehensive due diligence, whereas the revised text makes each step of the analysis process discretionary.

Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers.

                "changed_text": "1. DEFINITIONS Unless specifically defined within this Amendment, capitalized terms, singular or plural, used in this Amendment, shall have the meanings as commonly understood in the aviation industry, irrespective of any definitions in the GMA.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction by stating that capitalized terms will follow industry standards, even if the GMA defines them differently. This directly conflicts with the original text, which explicitly states that GMA definitions apply, leading to uncertainty in interpreting key terms.",

GOVERNING LAW - ARBITRATION 5.1 Governing law: Pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, the Parties hereto agree that this Amendment in all respects, and any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this Amendment, or any dealing between the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Amendment or the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company/Repairer relationship being established, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. as applied to contracts to be performed wholly within the State of New York (Exclusive of Section 7-101 of the New York General Obligations Law which is inapplicable to this Amendment).",
                "changed_text": "5. GOVERNING LAW - ARBITRATION 5.1 Governing law: This Amendment shall be governed by the principles of international commercial law, to the extent not inconsistent with the laws of Brazil, where the Company is incorporated. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any disputes by reference to these principles before resorting to arbitration.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict by stating that the Amendment will be governed by the laws of Brazil and international commercial law. This contradicts the original clause which states that New York law governs the amendment. The conflict creates uncertainty about which jurisdiction's laws apply to the contract, especially in the event of a dispute, and whether the parties must first attempt resolution under international commercial law principles.",

                "explanation": "This change creates a conflict because it states the confidentiality clause survives for 5 years, but then creates a way for it to be terminated. This makes it unclear whether the confidentiality requirements are fixed for 5 years or could be cancelled by either party with a 30-day notice. It is creating ambiguity regarding the enduring nature of the Confidentiality obligations.",

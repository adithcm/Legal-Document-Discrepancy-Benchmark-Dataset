However, for the purposes of Clause 2.1, capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth specifically in that Clause, irrespective of definitions in the GMA.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by stating that terms generally follow the GMA's definitions, but then creating an exception in Clause 2.1 where the GMA definitions are explicitly overridden. This creates uncertainty as to which definition applies outside of Clause 2.1 if related terms are used elsewhere.",

The added sentence, however, states that disclosure *is* allowed to subsidiaries directly involved in maintenance services without prior written consent.

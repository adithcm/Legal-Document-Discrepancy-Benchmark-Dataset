                "explanation": "This change introduces a time limit on the confidentiality obligations that did not exist before. This conflicts with the earlier statement in the main agreement (section 11.7) that the obligations in Exhibit A 'shall survive the termination or expiration of this endorsement agreement, regardless of cause or circumstances'. The contradiction lies in whether the confidentiality obligations are indefinite or limited to five years, raising potential legal questions regarding the duration of these obligations.",

                "explanation": "This change alters the mandatory 'shall be removed' to the permissive 'may be removed' and introduces a timeframe of thirty days following a written request from the Company. This is contradictory because while the original text requires the recipient to return all information by the completion of work for the company, the modified version introduces a condition where the removal and return of the information depend on the company's demand and a subsequent 30-day period. It becomes unclear whether the recipient is obligated to proactively return all information upon work completion or only when specifically requested by the company, potentially creating ambiguity regarding the timing and necessity of returning company information.",

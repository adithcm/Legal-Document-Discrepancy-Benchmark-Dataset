                "original_text": "7.1. Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be the sooner of six (6) months from the Effective Date, or replacement of this Agreement with a subsequent agreement between the Parties.",
                "changed_text": "7.1. Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be for six (6) months from the Effective Date, with an option to renew for another six (6) months upon mutual written agreement. This term shall automatically extend indefinitely beyond the initial six months, unless either party provides a written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of each six-month period.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Term' clearly states it ends after six months or when replaced by a new agreement. The modified version introduces ambiguity by suggesting an automatic extension, conflicting with the initial fixed term and creating uncertainty about the actual duration of the contract.",

The Company shall reimburse Consultant, in accordance with Company policy, for all reasonable expenses incurred by Consultant in performing the Services pursuant to this Agreement, but only if Consultant receives written consent from an authorized agent of the Company prior to incurring such expenses and submits receipts for such expenses to the Company in accordance with the Company's general expense reimbursement policies.",
                "changed_text": "1.3 Expenses. The Company shall reimburse Consultant, in accordance with what the Company considers to be reasonable expenses incurred by Consultant in performing the Services pursuant to this Agreement, only if Consultant submits receipts for such expenses to the Company; written consent is not required for expenses under $500.",
                "explanation": "This modifies the requirement for 'written consent' for expenses. The original text mandates it for ALL expenses, while the changed text waives it for expenses under $500, creating confusion on the exact approval process for expense reimbursement and a contradiction in enforcement of expense policies.",

Consultant does not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of this Agreement, consulting or other services for, or engage in or intend to engage in an employment relationship with, companies who businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services which would be competitive with the Company's products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by the Company during the term of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4.2 Covenant Not to Compete. Consultant will not perform consulting or other services for companies whose businesses directly compete with the Company's core products or services. However, the Consultant may engage in similar work for entities focused on market segments or geographical areas not currently targeted by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a broad non-compete clause covering any competitive businesses. The modified text introduces exceptions for market segments or areas 'not currently targeted' by the company. This contradicts the original intent of preventing any competition and creates ambiguity as to what constitutes permissible activity.",

Releasing Shipper          proposes to release capacity as set forth below, and in accordance with          the applicable provisions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff. Upon the          satisfaction of all conditions applicable to the proposed release          transaction, including all applicable provisions of Section 14 of the          General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff,          Releasing Shipper will consent to a partial and permanent assignment of          capacity on Transporter's system. Subject to the satisfaction of such          conditions by the Releasing Shipper and the Replacement Shipper,          Transporter will consent to this partial and permanent assignment of          capacity on its system, and will waive the requirement under Section          14.7 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas          Tariff, providing that Releasing Shipper shall remain the guarantor of          payment to Transporter of all demand charges arising under its Service          Agreement with Transporter for such assigned capacity.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses definitive language ('is a firm shipper', 'will consent'). The modified text uses more ambiguous language ('may be', 'may consent'), creating uncertainty about the firm nature of the shipper's status and the commitment to release capacity. This conflicts with the expectation of firm obligations in a transportation agreement.",

                "original_text": "1.1 \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the maximum daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth), that Transporter is obligated to deliver from time to time at the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the executed Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "1.1 \"Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO)\" means the typical daily quantity of natural gas, expressed in Dekatherms (Dth), that Transporter aims to deliver at the Point(s) of Delivery specified in Exhibit B to the executed Agreement. This target is subject to change based on operational conditions.",
                "explanation": "The original definition clearly states 'is obligated to deliver', creating a firm commitment. The modified definition uses 'aims to deliver', significantly weakening the obligation and introducing uncertainty about the commitment level. The added phrase 'subject to change based on operational conditions' further diminishes the firm nature of the obligation.",

This figure is not guaranteed and may fluctuate based on system capacity.",
                "explanation": "The initial definition states 'is obligated... which shall be 23,000 Dth', a definitive commitment. The revision changes this to 'anticipates transporting, with a target of 23,000 Dth', making it aspirational. The added disclaimer 'This figure is not guaranteed and may fluctuate based on system capacity' explicitly undermines the prior fixed quantity.",

Thereafter, this Agreement shall be effective month to month, until terminated by Transporter or Shipper upon the following written notice to the other specifying a termination date: sixty (60) days for interruptible transportation under Rate Schedule ITS and 180 days for firm transportation under Rate Schedule FTS. However, the term may be adjusted based on regulatory changes.",
                "explanation": "The original text says the agreement 'shall continue for a primary term of ten years' implying a fixed term. The modified version states it 'is expected to continue for a primary term of ten years', making it an expectation rather than a guarantee. The addition of 'However, the term may be adjusted based on regulatory changes' adds a contingency that allows for early termination, contradicting the initial suggestion of a fixed ten-year term. This creates ambiguity about the actual duration of the agreement.",

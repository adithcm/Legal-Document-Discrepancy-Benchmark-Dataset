                "explanation": "The original clause mandates voting 'all' shares in accordance with certain conditions. The modified clause now limits the mandatory voting commitment to 'up to 50%' of shares and removes the condition of voting inline with Institutional Shareholders Services' recommendation, allowing them to vote at their own discretion. Also the requirement for evidence of voting is removed.",

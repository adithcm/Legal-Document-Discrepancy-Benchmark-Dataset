                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflict in the definition of business hours. One section defines it as 07.30 to 18.00, while the other defines it as 08.00 to 17.00. This creates uncertainty regarding when standard service levels apply and impacts service requests and incident management.",

                "explanation": "The original text commits Datec to BSP's Disaster Recovery Plan, whilst the changed text prioritizes Datec's DRP while making best efforts to stick to BSP's. This leads to the question of which DRP should be followed first, creating disputes in times of disaster.",

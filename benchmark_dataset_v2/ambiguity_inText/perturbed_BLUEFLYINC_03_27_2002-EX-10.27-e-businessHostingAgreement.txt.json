Subcontractors or Services Recipients are explicitly excluded from being considered as providers of content under this section.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction because in Section 1.0(d), 'Content' is initially defined to include information, software, and data provided by the Customer, its Subcontractors, or Services Recipients. The modified definition excludes Subcontractors and Service Recipients, causing confusion about who is responsible for the content and its adherence to policies like the Acceptable Use Policy.",

                "explanation": "By removing 'in accordance with the applicable Service Option Attachments (which means the degree of knowledge, skill and judgment customarily exercised by members of the applicable profession with respect to work of a similar nature)' and removing 'fully trained, fully qualified and responsible', it creates an internal contradiction if another section states a different standard or set of required qualifications of IBM personnel or IBM service delivery processes. This makes the standard of care ambiguous.",

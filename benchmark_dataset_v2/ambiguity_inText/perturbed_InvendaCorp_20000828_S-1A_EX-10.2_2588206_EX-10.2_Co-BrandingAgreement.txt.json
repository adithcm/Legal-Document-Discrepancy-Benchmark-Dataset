                "explanation": "The original definitions of 'Excite@Home Member(s)' and 'Program Member(s)' establish a clear distinction based on opt-in status. The revised definitions introduce conflict. 'Excite@Home Member(s)' now requires explicit consent for sharing data, while 'Program Member(s)' suggests only the *potential* for data sharing. This creates uncertainty about the requirements for each category and whether explicit consent is always necessary.",

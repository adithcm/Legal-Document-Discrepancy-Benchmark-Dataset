                "original_text": "4.       Exclusivity. For the Initial Term of this Agreement, iVillage agrees that Ford shall be the exclusive automobile manufacturer sponsor and advertiser throughout the Network, with respect to entities whose primary business is that of an automotive manufacturer and/or retailer. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"retailer\" shall refer to an entity which sells new and/or used vehicles. In addition, in the event that iVillage desires to form a sponsorship relationship with an automobile rental company during the term of this Agreement, iVillage shall notify Hertz and provide Hertz with an opportunity to enter into such a relationship with iVillage, on not less favorable terms than those offered to any other automobile rental company. Once presented with an opportunity, Hertz shall have five (5) business days in which to accept or reject such terms. If iVillage does not receive Hertz's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem Hertz's silence as rejection. The terms of any such relationship shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FMC shall, on a non-exclusive basis, be permitted to offer Ford Motor Credit car financing products related to the purchase of Ford vehicles.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'retailer' has been changed. The original definition included entities that sell new or used vehicles. The modified definition limits 'retailer' to entities that advertise automobiles manufactured by others and are not directly involved in sales. This creates ambiguity because the exclusivity clause depends on the definition of retailer. It's now unclear whether the exclusivity extends to dealerships that primarily sell other manufacturer's vehicles but also sell used Ford vehicles or entities that primarily advertises automobiles.",

                "explanation": "The payment terms in section 5A and 5B now contradict each other. Section 5A states that quarterly payments will be made within ten days after the end of each quarter, while section 5B states that payments will be made within thirty days after the end of each quarter for the year 2000. This inconsistency creates uncertainty regarding the agreed-upon payment schedule for the year 2000.",

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable for any breach of this Agreement for any delay or failure of performance resulting from any cause beyond such Party's reasonable control, including but not limited to the weather, strikes or labor disputes (other than as set forth in Section 1.B), war, terrorist acts, riots or civil disturbances, government regulations, acts of civil or military authorities, or acts of God provided the Party affected takes all reasonably necessary steps to resume full performance. In the event that the Network or the Bridge Site are unavailable for a substantial period of time due an event of force majeur or otherwise, iVillage agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" any impressions lost as a result of such circumstance.",

                "explanation": "The change introduces a contradiction regarding iVillage's obligations during a force majeure event. The original text states that iVillage must use 'commercially reasonable efforts' to make good impressions lost. The revised text removes this obligation, stating that iVillage is 'not required to fulfill obligations of the agreement'. This contradicts the original language about commercially reasonable efforts and creates uncertainty about the extent of iVillage's duties during a force majeure.",

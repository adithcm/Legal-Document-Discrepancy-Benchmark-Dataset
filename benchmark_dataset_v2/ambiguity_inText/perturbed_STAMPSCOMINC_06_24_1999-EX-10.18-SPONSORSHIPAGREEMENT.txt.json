Intuit is not required to track click-throughs or provide additional information unless it chooses to do so.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement mandates monthly reports substantiating impression numbers and click-throughs. The modified version changes this to quarterly reports with estimated impression numbers and removes the obligation to track click-throughs.

This has been changed to a fixed 12 months from the effective date only. This contradicts the intent of Intuit to deliver, and Stamps.com to receive a set amount of advertisement impressions, leading to disputes on contract fulfillment.",

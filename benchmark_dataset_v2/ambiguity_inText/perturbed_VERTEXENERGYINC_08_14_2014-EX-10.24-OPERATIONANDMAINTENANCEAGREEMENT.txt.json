                "changed_text": "\"Force Majeure\" means any cause or causes within the reasonable control of the Party claiming suspension and which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, such Party is always able to prevent or overcome, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts, omissions to act, and/or delays in action of federal, state, or local government or any agency thereof, strikes, lockouts, work stoppages, or other industrial disturbances, acts of a public enemy, sabotage, wars, blockades, insurrections, riots, acts of terror, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms, storm warnings, floods, washouts, extreme cold or freezing weather, arrests and restraints of governments\nand people, civil or criminal disturbances, interruptions by governmental or court orders, present and future valid orders of any regulatory body having jurisdiction, explosions, mechanical failures, breakage, or accident to equipment installations, machinery, compressors, or lines of pipe, and associated repairs, freezing of wells or lines of pipe, partial or entire failure of wells, pipes, facilities, or equipment, electric power unavailability or shortages, failure of pipelines or carriers to transport, partial or entire failure or refusal of operators of upstream or downstream pipelines or facilities to receive used motor oil, governmental regulations, and inability to obtain or timely obtain, or obtain at a reasonable cost, after exercise of reasonable diligence, pipe, materials, equipment, rights-of-way, servitudes, governmental approvals, or labor, including those necessary for the facilities provided for in this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The first part of the definition contradicts the second part by changing 'not reasonably within the control' to 'within the reasonable control' and 'unable to prevent or overcome' to 'always able to prevent or overcome'. This change introduces ambiguity and creates an internal contradiction because the initial clause now suggests that a Force Majeure event is something controllable and preventable. Making it confusing to enforce the force majeure clause.",

Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, Owner hereby authorizes and empowers Operator, and Operator agrees, in the name of and on behalf of Owner, to, at its sole cost and expense, keep and maintain the Rail Facility in a condition and repair similar to, but not less than, its condition and repair on the Effective Date hereof.",

                "explanation": "The text specifies that the Operator maintains the rail facility at their sole cost and expense. Changing it to Owner's sole cost and expense contradicts the article 4.1.10 which specifies: 'Operator shall promptly pay all direct costs and expenses incurred in operating and maintaining the Rail Facility as they become due, without reimbursement by Owner save and except to the extent specifically provided otherwise herein.' This ambiguity creates an in-text contradiction.",

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, in the event of an Emergency, Operator shall proceed with maintenance or repair work or with any other action when necessary to minimize damage and to end the Emergency (\"Emergency Work\"), without regard to the limits set forth in this Article IV. Operator shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify Owner of the existence or occurrence of the Emergency, setting forth the nature of the emergency, the corrective action taken or proposed to be taken, and the actual or estimated cost of such corrective action. Emergency Work shall include only such work as is necessary to immediately address the Emergency and does not include any work necessary to restore the Rail Facility or improve the Rail Facility in order to permit continued operations.",

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, in the event of an Emergency, Operator shall proceed with maintenance or repair work or with any other action when necessary to minimize damage and to end the Emergency (\"Emergency Work\"), but only after receiving explicit approval from the Owner, unless communication is impossible. Operator shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify Owner of the existence or occurrence of the Emergency, setting forth the nature of the emergency, the corrective action taken or proposed to be taken, and the actual or estimated cost of such corrective action.

                "original_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "2. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date. Renewal will be discussed yearly, 30 days before the Term, to decide if it is in the best interest of both parties to renew. If neither party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other, the agreement will be extended by 90 days, to have a new agreement signed (\"Term\").",
                "explanation": "The original term allows for automatic annual renewal with a 30-day notice to terminate. The modified term introduces uncertainty by requiring a yearly renewal discussion and extends the agreement by 90 days if there is no agreement, creating a contradiction as to whether the renewal is automatic or requires active agreement. This impacts the predictability and enforceability of the contract term.",

                "changed_text": "A. Equity Payment: ESSI intends to provide Talent with one-million (1,000,000) shares of restricted common stock. The issuance of these shares is subject to board approval and compliance with all applicable securities laws and may be delayed depending on market conditions. The company expects to issue the shares as soon as reasonably practicable, but makes no guarantee as to a specific date.",
                "explanation": "The original clause states a clear obligation to issue shares within ten business days. The modified clause introduces significant ambiguity by making the issuance contingent on board approval, securities laws, and market conditions, removing the definite timeline and creating potential for non-issuance, which directly contradicts the initial obligation. This creates doubt about whether the equity payment is guaranteed.",

All ESSI uses of Talent Attributes in connection with the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be subject to the prior written approval of Talent. Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term. Talent may use said materials in whole or in part solely for the purpose of presenting Talent's work in Talent's personal portfolio, website or otherwise and/or on Talent's agent's website. Such usage may not be sold or transferred.",

ESSI will make reasonable efforts to obtain Talent's approval for uses of Talent Attributes in connection with Commercial Placements and/or press releases. While Talent's feedback is valued, ESSI retains ultimate discretion over the content. ESSI owns all rights to Commercial Placements and/or press releases, and ESSI may use them, or not use them, as outlined in Paragraph 3, as ESSI sees fit. Talent may reference these materials, in their work portfolio with written consent of ESSI.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates Talent's prior written approval within five days for commercial placements and press releases, implying ESSI needs that approval. The revised text weakens this by stating ESSI only makes \"reasonable efforts\" to get approval but retains \"ultimate discretion,\" making Talent's approval effectively optional. This creates a contradiction about Talent's control over their image and likeness being used, and adds ambiguity on usage rights.",

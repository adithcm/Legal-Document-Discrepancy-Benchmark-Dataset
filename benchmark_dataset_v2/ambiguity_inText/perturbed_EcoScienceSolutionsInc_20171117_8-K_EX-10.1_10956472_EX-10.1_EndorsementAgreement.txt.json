                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\").",
                "changed_text": "The term of this Agreement shall be for one (1) year commencing on the Effective Date and automatically renewing annually thereafter, unless either party provides a thirty-day notice of written termination one to the other (\"Term\"). However, ESSI may terminate this agreement at any time, with or without cause, by providing 10 days written notice to Talent.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the termination clause. Initially, the agreement specifies a 30-day notice for termination, implying mutual agreement or cause. The added sentence allows ESSI to terminate the agreement with only a 10-day notice, regardless of cause, contradicting the original term and creating uncertainty about the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated.",
                "location": "Paragraph 2"

            {
                "type": "Ambiguities - In Text Contradiction",
                "original_text": "During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10, Talent agrees to provide ESSI with the following: A. Upon request by ESSI, two (2) production sessions to be used for the production of the various medias to be used in Commercial placements (\"Production Sessions\"); the location, date and time of the Production Sessions shall be mutually agreed upon by Talent and ESSI. In the event any Production Session exceeds eight (8) hours in duration ESSI and Talent will negotiate in good faith additional compensation to Talent for time in excess of eight (8) hours.",
                "changed_text": "During the Term and subject to the limitations set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10, Talent agrees to provide ESSI with the following: A. Upon request by ESSI, two (2) production sessions to be used for the production of the various medias to be used in Commercial placements (\"Production Sessions\"); the location, date and time of the Production Sessions shall be determined solely by ESSI. In the event any Production Session exceeds eight (8) hours in duration, additional compensation to Talent for time in excess of eight (8) hours will be at ESSI's sole discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the location, date, and time of production sessions must be mutually agreed upon, and additional compensation for sessions exceeding 8 hours will be negotiated in good faith. The modified text gives ESSI the sole authority to determine the details of the production sessions and decides on the additional compensation. This contradicts the initial agreement for mutual decision-making and creates an internal contradiction about Talent's control and compensation for their services.",

                "original_text": "All ESSI uses of Talent Attributes in connection with the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be subject to the prior written approval of Talent. Said written approval must be given within five (5) business days of Talent's receipt or said usage shall be deemed unapproved. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; however, ESSI shall have the right to use said Commercial Placements and/or press releases solely as outlined in Paragraph 3 and only during the Term. Talent may use said materials in whole or in part solely for the purpose of presenting Talent's work in Talent's personal portfolio, website or otherwise and/or on Talent's agent's website. Such usage may not be sold or transferred.",
                "changed_text": "All ESSI uses of Talent Attributes in connection with the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be subject to the prior written approval of Talent, unless ESSI deems it necessary for immediate release. Any such usage featuring Talent in the Commercial Placements and/or press releases shall be and remain the property of ESSI; furthermore ESSI has the right to transfer or sell the materials to third parties. Talent may use said materials in whole or in part solely for the purpose of presenting Talent's work in Talent's personal portfolio, website or otherwise and/or on Talent's agent's website. Such usage may not be sold or transferred.",
                "explanation": "This introduces two contradictions. First, it allows ESSI to bypass Talent's approval for immediate releases, conflicting with the initial requirement for prior written approval. Second, it grants ESSI the right to transfer or sell the materials, contradicting the limitation on Talent's usage where they cannot sell or transfer. This creates confusion about ownership rights and the circumstances under which Talent's approval is required, potentially leading to disputes over control and monetization of Talent's attributes.",

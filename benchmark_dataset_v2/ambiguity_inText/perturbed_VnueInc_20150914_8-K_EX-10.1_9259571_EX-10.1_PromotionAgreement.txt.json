                "original_text": "Section 3. Expenses. VNUE shall reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein. Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred on a weekly basis, and VNUE shall reimburse Promoter within Thirty (30) Days of receipt of such accounting.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3. Expenses. VNUE shall reimburse Promoter for expenses incurred by Promoter while performing the duties herein, provided such expenses are pre-approved in writing by VNUE. Promoter shall deliver to VNUE an itemized accounting of expenses incurred, but reimbursement shall be at VNUE's sole discretion and based on available funds.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding expense reimbursement. The original text mandates reimbursement within 30 days of accounting. The modified version makes reimbursement conditional on pre-approval and VNUE's discretion, creating a contradiction about whether expenses are guaranteed to be reimbursed.",

At any time prior to the end of the Term, the Parties may agree in writing to extend the Agreement for successive One (1) Year periods (the \"Renewal Terms\") under the same conditions set forth herein.",

This agreement will automatically renew for successive One (1) Year periods (the \"Renewal Terms\") unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The terms of any such renewal shall be subject to renegotiation.",
                "explanation": "This change creates conflicting terms regarding renewal. The original text requires written agreement by both parties for renewal. The modified version states that the agreement automatically renews unless terminated, introducing uncertainty and potentially obligating parties beyond their intended commitment without explicit agreement. It also states that terms shall be 'subject to renegotiation' which contradicts 'under the same conditions set forth herein' from the original Section 6.",

For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE will compensate Promoter i) Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for each One (1) Year contract Promoter secures per venue and Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000,00) for each Two (2) Year contract Promoter secures per venue, with payment due to Promoter within Thirty (30) Days from the date on which each such contract is countersigned; and ii) through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to have fully earned by Promoter upon the date of each issuance of such stock certificates by VStock Transfer:\n\n\n\nFor every Five (5) music venues that sign a contract with VNUE, Six Hundred Thousand (600,000) shares of VNUE common stock shall be awarded to Promoter;\n\nand\n\nIf Ten (10) music venues sign a contract with VNUE before January 16, 2016, Promoter will receive an additional bonus of Three Hundred Thousand (300,000) shares of VNUE common stock.",
                "changed_text": "Section 2. Promoter's Fee. For providing services as set forth herein, VNUE will compensate Promoter i) Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for each contract Promoter secures per venue, regardless of the contract duration, with payment due to Promoter within Ninety (90) Days from the date on which each such contract is countersigned, subject to VNUE's cash flow availability; and ii) through the issuance of VNUE common stock as set forth below, and for the purposes of Rule 144 such shares of stock shall be deemed to have fully earned by Promoter only upon the successful completion of all Thirty (30) venue contracts:\n\n\n\nFor every Five (5) music venues that successfully generate a minimum of $10,000 in revenue for VNUE, Six Hundred Thousand (600,000) shares of VNUE common stock shall be awarded to Promoter;\n\nand\n\nIf Ten (10) music venues are secured by Promoter before January 16, 2016, subject to approval of VNUE's board, Promoter will receive an additional bonus of Three Hundred Thousand (300,000) shares of VNUE common stock.",
                "explanation": "This modification introduces multiple contradictions. First, it changes the fee structure for contracts, removing the differentiation based on contract duration and delaying payment while making it conditional on VNUE's cash flow. Second, it alters the conditions for stock issuance, requiring all contracts to be completed for the shares to be considered earned under Rule 144. Third, revenue generation is newly added to the condition to obtain shares which was previously simply 'sign a contract'. Lastly, the additional bonus now requires board approval, where none existed before. These create ambiguities regarding how and when the promoter will get compensation, potentially leading to disagreements.",

                "explanation": "The added phrase \"with one month's prior notice\" to clause (iii) and changed definition of studio lease introduces a conflicting condition for termination by Programmer, contradicting the immediate termination right under the original clause (iii) and changed location. If Section 11 allows immediate termination, this creates ambiguity. Whether studio lease is on the 7th or any floor can now be disputed.",

                "explanation": "The addition of \"provided however, that all programming decisions regarding the WLIB Programs remain within the sole discretion of the Programmer\" directly contradicts the Licensee's stated \"full authority, power and control over the operation of the Station\". This creates a clear conflict regarding who ultimately controls the programming content. Also added clause to consult before Licensee do that. Similarly, The addition to include programmer by giving them alternative programming slots in case of preemption creates ambiguity of the role of each other.",

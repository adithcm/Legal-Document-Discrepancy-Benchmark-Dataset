The modified text changes this to 'reasonable efforts' and limits the usage to 'TPC sponsored events'. This creates a contradiction if other sections of the contract assume Ogle's broader usage of the product.",

                "explanation": "The original text states 'Said Retainer Fee shall be paid', making the payment schedule mandatory. The modified text changes 'shall' to 'may', making the payment schedule optional.

                "explanation": "Originally, the proration of the Retainer Fee is linked to Ogle failing to meet the minimum play requirement. The modification changes the condition to Ogle 'choosing' to play, implying that the proration applies if he *does* meet the minimum play requirement. This creates an internal conflict regarding the conditions for proration. This is creating uncertainty regarding when the proration happens.",

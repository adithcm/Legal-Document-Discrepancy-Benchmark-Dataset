                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by narrowing the definition of \"Material\" defects. Initially, all priority A, B, and C errors were considered material defects. Now, only priority A errors are explicitly defined as material. This creates uncertainty because a failure related to priority B or C could now be argued as not being a 'Defect' under this definition, impacting warranty and support obligations.",

D2 warrants to LICENSEE that the media upon which the Licensed Technology is delivered to LICENSEE will be free from Defects in materials and workmanship, and that Licensed Technology shall meet and perform in accordance with D2's specifications on Exhibit A. D2 shall promptly correct any errors in the Licensed Technology, or failures of the Licensed Technology according to the terms of Article 6 of this Agreement. D2's warranty and error correction obligations with respect to any portion of the Licensed Technology shall extend for a period (the \"Warranty period\") of one year commencing on acceptance of such portion of the Licensed Technology by LICENSEE.",

D2 warrants to LICENSEE that the media upon which the Licensed Technology is delivered to LICENSEE will be free from Defects in materials and workmanship, but makes no guarantee regarding performance in accordance with D2's specifications on Exhibit A. D2 may, at its discretion, correct errors in the Licensed Technology. D2's warranty obligations with respect to any portion of the Licensed Technology shall extend for a period (the \"Warranty period\") of 90 days commencing on delivery of such portion of the Licensed Technology by D2 to LICENSEE.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states D2 *shall* correct errors and guarantees performance to Exhibit A specifications for one year post-acceptance. The modified clause changes 'shall promptly correct' to 'may, at its discretion, correct', removes the performance guarantee, and shortens the warranty period to 90 days starting from delivery. This creates a conflict because other clauses in the contract assume a mandatory correction obligation and a longer warranty period tied to acceptance, leading to disputes over D2's responsibilities.",

Since, there is no clause allowing for selecting only one and both are under 'shall' clauses, this can lead to conflicts of the proper venue for any litigation that arises.",

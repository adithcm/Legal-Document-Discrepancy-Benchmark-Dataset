The modified text introduces ambiguity by giving D2 the discretion to provide notice and altering the correction schedule to be less stringent (changing calendar days to business days, increasing response and closure times, and changing \"Next Update or New Version\" to \"As Available\"). This creates a contradiction, as the original text implies a guaranteed level of error correction service, while the new language allows D2 to potentially delay or avoid these obligations, introducing uncertainty in enforcement.",

                "explanation": "The original warranty provides a firm commitment that the Licensed Technology will meet the specifications and any errors will be promptly corrected with obligations extending for one year from acceptance. The modified warranty weakens the specifications requirement to 'substantially meet' with performance according to D2's 'high-level intentions', changes the error correction obligation to a discretionary 'endeavor', and reduces the warranty period to 90 days, starting 30 days AFTER delivery, thus potentially reducing the actual warranty coverage time. This creates a conflict regarding the standard of performance and the duration of the warranty, leading to uncertainty about D2's obligations and LICENSEE's rights.",

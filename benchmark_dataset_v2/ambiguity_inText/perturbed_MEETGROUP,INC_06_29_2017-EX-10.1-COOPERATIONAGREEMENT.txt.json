This creates a contradiction and ambiguity as it is unclear whether both new directors are required to be appointed to a committee or just one.",

                "explanation": "The original text includes 'Associates' in the non-disparagement clause. The modified text removes 'Associates' from the initial part of the sentence ('neither it nor any of its Affiliates or Associates will'), while maintaining it when referring to the targets of disparagement ('Company...Associates, subsidiaries...'). This creates a contradiction because it is unclear whether investors are required to prevent their associates from disparaging the company or not. One part suggests 'Associates' are free to disparage, but the other suggests they are not.",

                "explanation": "The original text includes 'to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law' applying to the entire clause (c). The modified text removes that phrase. In the original, the waiver in (i), (ii), and (iii) of (c) is only to the fullest extent permitted by law. By removing that phrase, the modified text indicates that the waiver applies, regardless of whether the law allows it, thus making the two texts contradictory.",

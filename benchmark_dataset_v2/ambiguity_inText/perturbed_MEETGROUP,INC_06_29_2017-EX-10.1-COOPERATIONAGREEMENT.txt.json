                "changed_text": "The Company agrees that each of the New Directors shall receive (i) the same benefits of director and officer insurance, but indemnity and exculpation arrangements may vary depending on their individual risk profiles as determined by the Board, (ii) the compensation for his service as a director may be less than the compensation received by other non-management directors on the Board if they do not meet performance benchmarks established by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) such other benefits may be subject to additional requirements not applicable to other non-management directors on the Board.",
                "explanation": "The original text states New Directors receive the 'same benefits' and 'same compensation' as other non-management directors. The modified text introduces contingencies and potential variations, creating ambiguity and contradicting the original intention of equal treatment. This could lead to disputes over benefits and compensation eligibility.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses 'material breach' and a three-day cure period. The modified text uses 'any breach' and a five-day cure period. This creates a contradiction because other sections of the agreement may refer to a 'material breach' with a different cure period, or impose different penalties for immaterial breaches. This inconsistency could result in disputes over what constitutes a breach that triggers the non-disparagement clause's termination.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that personal delivery and facsimile delivery are effective 'upon receipt'. The modified version states personal delivery is effective 'upon dispatch' and email delivery is effective 'upon sending'. Also, the original text states that overnight delivery is effective 'one (1) business day' compared to the modified version with 'two (2) business days'. This creates a contradiction because the definitions conflict, especially when important deadlines are involved and proof of delivery is paramount. This inconsistency could result in disputes over whether a notice was timely given and thus whether a party acted appropriately. The email sending part modification also contradicts the confirmation of receipt, creating further conflict.",

                "original_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering, unless extended (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.",
                "changed_text": "The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering, unless extended (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or 90 days following the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may separately consider an amendment to this agreement, but there is no obligation for either party to do so.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment deadline for fees. The original text states fees are payable at the earlier of the Closing Date or the End Date, while the modified version extends the End Date to 90 days. This creates ambiguity as to when the fees are actually due.",

                "changed_text": "The Holding Company will not sell or issue, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, for a period of 180 days after the Closing Date, without the Agent's prior written consent, any of its shares of common stock, other than the Shares or other than in connection with any plan or arrangement described in the Prospectus.",
                "explanation": "This change contradicts another section of the agreement that might specify a different lock-up period or have a clause that allows an earlier release of shares under certain conditions without the Agent's consent. The agreement originally states '90 days,' but the modified version changes it to '180 days,' creating uncertainty.",

No forward-looking statement (within the meaning of Section 27A of the 1933 Act and Section 21E of the 1934 Act) contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus has been made or reaffirmed without a reasonable basis or has been disclosed other than in good faith.",

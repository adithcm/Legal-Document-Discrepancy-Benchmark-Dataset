                "original_text": "3.5 Client. A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that SMBC/Nikko Introduces to Moelis Holdings pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, a Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",

A \"Client\" is (i) with respect to SMBC/Nikko, a Japanese Company that SMBC/Nikko Introduces to Moelis Holdings pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) with respect to Moelis Holdings, any person or entity within Covered Regions that Moelis Holdings Introduces to SMBC/Nikko pursuant to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "This change creates ambiguity regarding the definition of 'Client'. Initially, both parties agree a client is a 'Japanese Company or any other person or entity within Covered Regions'. The modified version limits SMBC/Nikko's clients to strictly 'Japanese Companies', while Moelis Holdings' clients can be 'any person or entity within Covered Regions'. This contradiction is problematic when determining fee allocation (Article IV), non-solicitation (Article V), and confidentiality (Article X) because the definition is no longer consistent.",

This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing. The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the initial term. At any time during a renewed term, this Agreement may be terminated by any party on six (6) months prior notice that it wishes to terminate the Agreement.",

                "explanation": "This modification introduces a conflicting definition of how the agreement is to be renewed. The original text states, 'unless *a party* provides written notice', implying any single party can prevent renewal. The modified text states, 'unless *all parties* provide written notice', implying that all parties must agree to end the renewal. This impacts termination (11.2) and the effect of termination (11.3).",

In the case where one party executes an engagement letter with a Client (the \"Main-Advisor Party\") and the Main-Advisor Party appoints and retains the other party or parties as a sub-advisor (the \"Sub-Advisor Party\"), each of the Main-Advisor Party and the Sub-Advisor Party shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws or regulations, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and any other similar anti-bribery act in its execution and performance of its services for the Covered Businesses for such Client. If either of the Main-Advisor Party or Sub-Advisor Party breaches its obligations set forth in this Section 8.4, the non- breaching party shall have the right to immediately terminate its sub-advisor agreement or any other similar agreement entered into with respect to the Covered Businesses for such Client by providing a written notice to the breaching party that specifically identifies how the breaching party has breached this Section 8.4.",

                "explanation": "Originally, Section 8.4 stated that each party 'shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws', whereas, the modified version states that each party 'shall comply in all respects with all applicable laws'. This contradiction matters because, if one section allows for *immaterial* breaches of law, whereas the other one doesn't, it is not clear what the actual obligations and standards of compliance are. This creates uncertainty when determining whether there is a valid basis for contract termination and the remediation steps.",

This       Attachment will automatically be renewed for periods of six (6) months       unless either party gives twelve (12) months written notice of its intent       to terminate this Agreement.

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by presenting conflicting renewal terms. The original states a six-month renewal period with twelve months' notice, while the modified version specifies a twelve-month renewal period with six months' notice. This contradiction would create uncertainty regarding the actual term of the agreement after the initial three years and the required notice period for termination.",

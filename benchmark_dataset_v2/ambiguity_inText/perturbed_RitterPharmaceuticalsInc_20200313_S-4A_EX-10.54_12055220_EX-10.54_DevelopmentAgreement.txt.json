Affiliate shall mean, (i) with respect to Qualigen, any corporation or other form of business organization, which directly or indirectly owns, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Qualigen, and (ii), with respect to Sekisui, shall mean Sekisui Diagnostics (UK) Ltd., Sekisui Diagnostics PEI, Inc., SEKISUI MEDICAL CO., LTD., and Sekisui Diagnostics GmbH. An entity shall be regarded as being in control of another entity if the former entity has the direct or indirect power to vote more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities (or other ownership interest for a business organization other than a corporation) of that entity, or the direct or indirect ability to direct or cause the direction of the general management and policies of the other entity.",

For purposes of Section 9, regarding Sale Transactions, an Affiliate of Qualigen shall also include any entity in which Qualigen's officers or directors hold a beneficial interest of 10% or more, regardless of control.",
                "explanation": "The definition of 'Affiliate' is expanded in Section 9 to include entities where Qualigen's officers/directors have a significant, but non-controlling, interest. This conflicts with the general definition in Section 1.2 that relies on 'control,' creating ambiguity as to what constitutes an affiliate in the context of Sale Transactions. This ambiguity could impact the interpretation and enforcement of exclusivity provisions.",

Sekisui shall submit to Qualigen by the fifth day of each calendar month a rolling twelve (12) month (month-by-month) forecast of the quantity of each Product that Sekisui anticipates selling during the following twelve (12) months (the \"Forecast\"). As to Reagent Kits each respective Forecast shall represent reasonable estimates to be used for planning and inventory stocking purposes as indicated in Exhibit D, and shall not be binding on Sekisui; provided, however, that as to Instruments the quantities for each of the first three months of each respective Forecast shall be deemed to constitute and shall constitute firm, binding orders for such quantities of Instruments in such respective months (but in no event for a lesser quantity for a month than the quantity for such month which, pursuant to an earlier Forecast, had already become a firm, binding order).",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sekisui may adjust the quantities of Instruments in the first three months of each respective Forecast by providing written notice to Qualigen at least one week prior to the beginning of each month, provided that such adjustments do not exceed 20% of the initially forecasted quantities.",
                "explanation": "Section 3.2 initially states that the forecast for instruments are 'firm, binding orders'. The added sentence allows Sekisui to adjust the instrument quantities in the first three months of each forecast, thus contradicting the earlier statement that these forecasts are firm and binding. This creates uncertainty about the enforceability of the instrument forecasts, because it introduces a conditional modification clause that might be hard to enforce.",

The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Reagent Kits Products shall be based upon a formula intended to ensure that Sekisui will receive 90% of the total Available Margin for all Products during the first 12 months of this Agreement, 70% of the total Available Margin for all Products during months 13-24 of this Agreement, and 65% of the total Available Margin for all Products thereafter. Accordingly, the prices (established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits) to be paid by Sekisui for the Products shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) for each respective prospective six month period in the manner set forth in Exhibit D. The initial prices Sekisui agrees to pay for the respective Products for the first such prospective \"six month period\" (in this instance actually a five month period: May-September 2016) shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) in the manner set forth in Exhibit D. Thereafter such prices shall be revisited and recalculated (prospectively) every six months in the manner set forth in Exhibit D (i.e., for purposes of such calculations for establishing the new prospective prices for the reagent products, the applicable Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin shall be the Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin for the applicable historical 6-month period as defined in Exhibit D). In addition, on a semi-annual basis, such amount shall be reviewed based on the actual Net Revenue, COGS and Available Margin for the 6 months then ended. In the event that such review results in a difference from the intended share of Available Margin between the Parties as contemplated above, the Parties shall make a true up payment between them in order to compensate for such overpayment or shortfall, all as provided in Exhibit D. Any true-up payments shall be paid by the applicable Party within 30 days of the receipt of an invoice for the agreed to true up amount.

                "explanation": "The added sentence 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sekisui shall not be required to set customer selling prices in a way that may breach prior pricing commitments, but shall endeavor to set new prices with customer opportunities' introduces an exception to Sekisui’s obligation. This creates ambiguity regarding Sekisui’s obligation to 'set the customer selling prices in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.' because it potentially allows Sekisui to maintain unfavorable pricing due to 'prior pricing commitments.'",

Customer Locations must be available for installation within 90 days of approval by Hydraspin to be applied toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark. All Customer Locations in excess of 25 secured during an applicable 12 month period shall be credited toward the satisfaction of the Performance Benchmark for the subsequent 12 month period. If this Agreement is extended beyond the Initial Term, as hereinafter defined, the number of Customer Locations to be secured to maintain exclusivity during the pendency of the Agreement shall be increased to 50 from 25.",

Customer Locations should ideally be available for installation within 90 days of approval by Hydraspin. Customer Locations in excess of 25 secured during an applicable 12 month period may be credited toward the Performance Benchmark for the subsequent 12 month period at Hydraspin's discretion. If this Agreement is extended beyond the Initial Term, as hereinafter defined, the number of Customer Locations to be secured to maintain exclusivity during the pendency of the Agreement may remain at 25 at Hydraspin's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'requirements' to 'guidelines,' 'shall' to 'good faith efforts' and 'should aim,' and the introduction of Hydraspin's discretion makes the performance benchmarks non-binding and open to interpretation, conflicting with the original intention of strict performance metrics. The wordings 'must be' becomes 'should ideally be'.",

Hydraspin shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver Products to Customers by the delivery dates specified in Distributor's Orders. Products shall be delivered directly to the Customer. All costs and expenses of shipping, freight, delivery, transportation and storage, including, without limitation, insurance covering the Products during transportation and while stored at any facility will be borne solely by Hydraspin and the Distributor shall not be liable therefor. Risk of loss shall be borne entirely by Hydraspin, even while Products are in the possession or control of Distributor or any customer, and the Distributor and the customers shall not be liable therefor, except solely in the case of Distributor's or any customer's intentional misconduct or gross negligence. Hydraspin may request Distributor to store Products at Distributor's facilities, and Distributor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Hydraspin's storage requests; provided, that Hydraspin shall bear the full risk of loss with respect to Products stored at Distributor's facility and Distributor shall not be liable therefor, except solely in the case of Distributor's intentional misconduct or gross negligence.",
                "changed_text": "5.2 Delivery; Storage; Risk of Loss. Hydraspin shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver Products to Customers by the delivery dates specified in Distributor's Orders if feasible. Products will generally be delivered directly to the Customer. All costs and expenses of shipping, freight, delivery, transportation and storage may be shared between Hydraspin and the Distributor as agreed upon on a case-by-case basis. Risk of loss shall generally be borne by Hydraspin, but may be transferred to the Distributor under certain circumstances defined in a separate agreement. Hydraspin may request Distributor to store Products at Distributor's facilities, and Distributor shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate Hydraspin's storage requests. Hydraspin and Distributor will negotiate the risk of loss of Products stored at Distributor's facility in good faith.",
                "explanation": "The insertion of qualifiers like 'if feasible', 'generally,' and 'may be shared' and the reference to 'certain circumstances defined in a separate agreement' introduces significant uncertainty regarding the responsibility for delivery, costs, and risk of loss. These modifications contradict the original's clear assignment of these responsibilities solely to Hydraspin. This creates ambiguity and potential disputes about who bears these responsibilities under which conditions.",

The Parties shall use their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same shall be submitted to arbitration and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and finally settled by confidential binding arbitration, except as specifically provided otherwise herein. The confidential arbitration proceeding shall be held in Collin County, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the alternative dispute resolution rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration proceeding shall be held before a single arbitrator unless (i) the matter in controversy exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (ii) the Parties cannot agree on the arbitrator, or (iii) either Party requests a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and any order of enforcement as the case may be. The arbitrator shall not award any Party punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to seek such damages in arbitration or in judicial proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the right and authority to apportion among the parties all reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, taking into account the relative fault of the Parties. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11.9 do not limit the right of a Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending resolution of a dispute by arbitration.",

The Parties should consider using their respective best efforts to settle amicably any disputes, differences or controversies arising between the Parties out of or in connection with or in respect of this Agreement. However, if not so settled, then the same may be submitted to arbitration and, to the extent permitted by law, may be settled by confidential non-binding arbitration, if both parties agree at the time of the dispute.

It is no longer a guaranteed method of dispute resolution. Each party retains the right to seek damages in court, and the arbitrator's power to make awards is greatly limited, introducing uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "Removed the barrels of fluid per day requirement and changed the number of Customer Locations in the extended term, creating an internal contradiction regarding the requirements to maintain exclusivity. In the original text, there were two requirements: new locations and barrels of fluid. By removing (b), there is now no requirement for generating an average of 7,500 barrels of fluid per day on a trailing 12 month basis. This makes it ambiguous whether (b) is still needed.",

This edit creates a contradiction. In its original form, subsection (5) allowed termination only if the failure of a license, permit or authorization prevents Hydraspin from being able to perform all its obligations. But the text now makes no mention of Hydraspin not being able to perform most of their duties.",

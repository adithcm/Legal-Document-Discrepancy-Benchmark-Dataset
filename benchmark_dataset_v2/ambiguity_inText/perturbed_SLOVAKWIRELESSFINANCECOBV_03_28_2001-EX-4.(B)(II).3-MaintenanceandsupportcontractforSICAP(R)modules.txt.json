                "explanation": "The original text states that EuroTel decides the priority of the requests. However, the modified text gives Sicap Ltd the right to decide the priority. This contradiction can lead to disputes, especially if EuroTel believes an incident is an emergency, while Sicap Ltd classifies it as low or medium priority, affecting the response time. Also, the change from 'perform every possibility' to 'attempt' weakens the obligation.",

                "explanation": "The original definition of 'SICAP(R) Software' is simple: Specific software supplied by Sicap Ltd. The modified definition includes updates, documentation and third-party software potentially causing ambiguity. The original says a SICAP(R) Module could be integrated separately or not, but the modified says it must always be integrated and cannot work independently, creating contradiction. The original 'System' includes third party software/hardware, but the modified states System means just the SICAP(R) Software. These contradictions blur responsibilities if something goes wrong with third-party components.",

                "explanation": "The original states EuroTel gets one month to decide after a price increase; the modified version implies immediate termination if EuroTel doesn't accept the new price, which reduces EuroTel's power. The original requires a registered letter six weeks before renewal, while the modified needs email notification just one week before. The email is a lower standard and causes issues in proof, which causes additional problems in evidence. The original says there's no reimbursement, but the modified says there's a prorated reimbursement, which causes more ambiguity on what happens after termination.",

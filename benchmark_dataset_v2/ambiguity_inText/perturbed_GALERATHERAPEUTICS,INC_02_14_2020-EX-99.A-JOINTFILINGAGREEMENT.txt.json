                "original_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; but none of them is responsible for the completeness or accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that such information is inaccurate.",
                "changed_text": "Each of them is responsible for the timely filing of such filings and any amendments thereto, and for the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning such person contained therein; and each of them is also responsible for ensuring, to the best of their ability, the completeness and accuracy of the information concerning the other persons making the filing, regardless of their actual knowledge of inaccuracies.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding responsibility for the accuracy of information provided by other parties. Originally, parties were only responsible if they knew or suspected inaccuracies. The modified text makes each party responsible for the others' accuracy 'to the best of their ability', irrespective of direct knowledge, which broadens the liability in one part of the agreement compared to the initial clause.",

                "changed_text": "This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until revoked by a majority of the parties hereto in a signed writing provided to each other party hereto. Any single party may withdraw by providing 30 days written notice, but such withdrawal does not terminate this agreement for the remaining parties.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflicting conditions for termination. The original text allows any single party to revoke the agreement for themselves. The modified text states the agreement remains in effect until revoked by a majority, but also introduces an ambiguous condition where a single party can 'withdraw' without affecting the agreement for others, creating uncertainty regarding their ongoing obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Each party is individually responsible for the timely filing of their respective documents. However, to streamline the process, one designated lead party will handle all submissions, and each other party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless that lead party for any errors or omissions in their individual filings, regardless of whether the lead party reviewed the filings.",
                "explanation": "Here, the contradiction arises between individual responsibility for filings and the transfer of liability to the lead party through indemnification. While each party is initially stated as responsible, the indemnification clause effectively shifts the risk of errors and omissions to the individual parties, while the lead party is responsible for making sure it is filed. If the lead party omits any filings from other parties that were not fully completed, they are not held accountable. This introduces confusion about the extent to which individual parties retain liability.",

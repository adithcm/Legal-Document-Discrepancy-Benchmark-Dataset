                "original_text": "Seller does hereby transfer, sell, assign, convey and deliver to Backhaul all right, title and interest in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the Trademarks and Patents set forth on Schedules A and B hereof, respectively, and all goodwill of the Purchased Business associated therewith. Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time forthwith upon the reasonable written request of Backhaul or Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "changed_text": "Seller does hereby transfer, sell, assign, convey and deliver to Backhaul all right, title and interest in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property, including the Trademarks and Patents set forth on Schedules A and B hereof, respectively, and all goodwill of the Purchased Business associated therewith. Seller hereby covenants and agrees, that from time to time only upon the mutual written agreement of Backhaul and Buyer, that Seller will, at Backhaul's cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, each and all of such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and assurances as may reasonably be required by Backhaul or Buyer in order to transfer, assign, convey and deliver unto and vest in Backhaul title to all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the Assigned Intellectual Property.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the Seller will act 'upon the reasonable written request of Backhaul or Buyer'. The modified text changes this to 'only upon the mutual written agreement of Backhaul and Buyer'. This introduces a contradiction, as the first definition implies that either Backhaul or Buyer can initiate action, while the second requires agreement from both, potentially leading to a deadlock. This affects the certainty and ease of enforcing further assignments.",

Nothing contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement shall be deemed to supersede any of the obligations, agreements, representations, covenants or warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "This Intellectual Property Agreement is subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement and is intended only to document the assignment of the Assigned Intellectual Property. However, in the event of a conflict between this Intellectual Property Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement, this Intellectual Property Agreement shall govern with respect to the assignment of Intellectual Property. Nothing contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement shall be deemed to supersede any of the obligations, agreements, representations, covenants or warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement, except as expressly stated herein regarding Intellectual Property assignment.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Intellectual Property Agreement is subject to the Asset Purchase Agreement and does not supersede it. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that in case of conflict regarding IP assignment, the IP Agreement prevails. This creates ambiguity and uncertainty, as it's unclear when the Asset Purchase Agreement takes precedence and when the IP Agreement does, specifically concerning IP assignment clauses. This will greatly confuse the order in which to enforce.",

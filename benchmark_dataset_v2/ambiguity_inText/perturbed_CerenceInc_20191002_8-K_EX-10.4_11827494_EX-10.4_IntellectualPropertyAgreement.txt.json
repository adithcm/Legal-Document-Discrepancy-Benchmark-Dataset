                "original_text": "ARTICLE VIII TRANSFERABILITY AND ASSIGNMENT\n\nSection 8.01. No Assignment or Transfer Without Consent. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party's assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party's assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party's Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",
                "changed_text": "ARTICLE VIII TRANSFERABILITY AND ASSIGNMENT\n\nSection 8.01. Assignment or Transfer Allowed. This Agreement and all rights, interests, and obligations hereunder, including licenses, may be assigned freely by either Party, in whole or in part, without the need for prior written consent from the other Party. The assigning Party shall provide written notice of the assignment to the other Party within a reasonable time after such assignment has occurred. Such notice will be considered informational only and will not affect the validity of the assignment. Any assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.",
                "explanation": "The original text prohibits assignment without prior written consent, whereas the changed text allows for free assignment with only a notification requirement. This contradiction introduces ambiguity and could lead to disputes regarding the validity of assignments made without consent, particularly if the non-assigning party claims lack of proper notification or challenges the 'reasonable time' frame. The original text states 'Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void,' but now it's implicitly allowed, leading to conflicting interpretations.",

Any disputes relating to, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including to its execution, performance, or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.",

Each Party consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction, forum, and venue of the courts of the State of California, located in Los Angeles County, over any claims, disputes, or disagreements between the Parties or their Affiliates, successors, and assigns related to this Agreement.

This contradiction creates uncertainty about which state's law governs the agreement and where disputes must be resolved. This is a clear and direct conflict regarding a key provision, making enforcement problematic.",

Oral agreements between authorized representatives of each Party shall also constitute valid amendments to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original clause requires written amendments signed by both parties. The modified text allows for amendments through conduct and oral agreements. This contradiction creates ambiguity as to how the contract can be validly altered. Specifically, it introduces conflicting conditions for amendments: the formal written requirement versus informal conduct and oral agreements. This creates uncertainty as to the validity of any changes made to the agreement which opens it up to legal conflict and challenges regarding the enforcement of the contract.",

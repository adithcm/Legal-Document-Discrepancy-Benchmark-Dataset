                "explanation": "The original text states that termination of a Defaulting Sponsor's participation shall *not* affect the rights of a Participating Sponsor against them. The modified text states the opposite: termination *will* affect the rights. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the consequences of terminating a Defaulting Sponsor, making the enforcement of rights and remedies against Defaulting Sponsors uncertain.",

For purposes hereof, \"Continuing Sponsor\" shall mean and refer to each Participating Sponsor that becomes a member of Purchaser and a party to the Purchaser LLC Agreement and Security Holder Agreements (collectively, the \"Management-Ownership Agreements\"), in each case, as long as such Sponsor continues to be a member of Purchaser and comply with the Management-Ownership Agreements.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 'unanimous consent of the Continuing Sponsors' for decisions during the Interim Period, ensuring all Continuing Sponsors agree. The modified text changes this to 'the consent of a majority of the Continuing Sponsors.' This creates a conflict: Section 1 requires unanimous consent of all Sponsors on key decisions until the Acceptance Time. If the Acceptance Time occurs, and these sponsors become Continuing Sponsors, it is unclear whether Section 1 requirements will prevail or only a majority is needed.",

The modified text removes 'material', suggesting indemnification is required for *any* breach, regardless of its significance. This creates a conflict: if a minor, immaterial breach occurs, it is unclear whether indemnification is required under the modified Section 15, while Section 15's original language implies it is not.",

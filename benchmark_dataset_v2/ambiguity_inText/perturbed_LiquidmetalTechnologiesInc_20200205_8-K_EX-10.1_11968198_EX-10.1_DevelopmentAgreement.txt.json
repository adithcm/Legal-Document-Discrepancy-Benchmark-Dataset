                "original_text": "5.1 Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement hereunder for default if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however, no termination right shall accrue until thirty (30) days after the defaulting Party is notified in writing of the material breach and has failed to cure within the thirty (30) day period after notice of a material breach.",
                "changed_text": "5.1 Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement hereunder for default if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement; provided, however, no termination right shall accrue until thirty (30) days after the defaulting Party is notified in writing of the material breach, unless the breaching party demonstrates reasonable progress toward rectifying the breach, as solely determined by the non-breaching party.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines a clear 30-day cure period for a material breach. The modified text introduces subjectivity and uncertainty by stating the cure is dependent on 'reasonable progress' as determined by the non-breaching party. This conflicts with the initial 30-day clear standard, potentially leading to disputes about what constitutes 'reasonable progress' and allowing for arbitrary termination.",

Acceptance of the Liquidmetal Product shall be based on characteristics that are measurable by a quality system and designed to demonstrate compliance with the Specifications. Unless Liquidmetal notifies Eutectix that the Liquidmetal Product does not meet the Specifications within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, then the Liquidmetal Product shall be deemed Accepted.",
                "changed_text": "3.9 Acceptance. Acceptance of the Liquidmetal Product shall be based on characteristics that are measurable by a quality system and designed to demonstrate compliance with the Specifications. Liquidmetal has thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Liquidmetal Product, to inspect, and depending on the sole discretion of the company's acceptance team's availability, the inspection shall commence. After which, if the product does not meet the specification, shall be deemed rejected.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a clear 30-day period for rejection based on measurable specifications. The modified version introduces subjectivity by stating the inspection depends on the availability of the acceptance team, delaying rejection without setting a specific limit on this delay. This contradicts the strict 30-day term, creating uncertainty about the period Eutectix is exposed to keep inventory of product awaiting acceptance.",

During the initial three (3) years of the Term of this Agreement, Eutectix shall make available alloy raw materials equal in kind and quantity to the Transferred Alloy without cost, for use in Orders (as defined in Section 3.1 below) placed by Liquidmetal.",

During the initial three (3) years of the Term of this Agreement, Eutectix shall make reasonable efforts to make available alloy raw materials equal in kind and quantity to the Transferred Alloy without cost, for use in Orders (as defined in Section 3.1 below) placed by Liquidmetal.",
                "explanation": "The original text states a definitive obligation for Eutectix to provide alloy raw materials. The modified version weakens this obligation by introducing the 'reasonable efforts' qualifier. This contradicts the firm commitment, creating uncertainty about Eutectix's responsibility to provide materials, leading to potential disputes over its definition and what measures are necessary to fulfill its obligations.",

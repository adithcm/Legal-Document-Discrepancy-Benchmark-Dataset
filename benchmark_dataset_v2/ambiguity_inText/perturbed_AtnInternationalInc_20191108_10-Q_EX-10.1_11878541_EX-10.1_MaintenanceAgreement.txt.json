                "explanation": "In the original text, the definition of 'Control' specifies a 50% ownership threshold. Modifying this to 25% in this section introduces an in-text contradiction, as other sections might rely on the 50% threshold. This inconsistency could create disputes regarding rights and obligations tied to 'Control'.",

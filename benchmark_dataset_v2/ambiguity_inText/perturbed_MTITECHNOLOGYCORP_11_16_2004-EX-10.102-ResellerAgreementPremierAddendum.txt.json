                "explanation": "The original definition of 'SOFTWARE' only includes machine executable object code, while the modified definition includes both object code and source code. This creates a contradiction as to what exactly is being licensed, potentially affecting the scope of allowed use and modifications.",

                "changed_text": "4.1 TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other party. However, such termination without cause by Reseller is subject to a termination fee equivalent to 10% of the average annual revenue generated over the past three years.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction. The original clause allows termination without cause and without penalty. The modified version adds a termination fee for Reseller, making the 'without cause' termination conditional and potentially creating a dispute over the fairness of the fee.",

In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be finally resolved in Denver, Colorado (USA) by arbitration under the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, using three arbitrators, one selected by each of McDATA and Reseller and the third selected in accordance with such Rules. The\narbitrators will decide the issues presented to them applying the substantive laws of the Sate of Colorado (USA). The award of the arbitrators may be granted notwithstanding the absence of any party and such award shall be in writing and shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall not be appealed from or contested in any court or tribunal. Any award rendered hereunder may be entered for enforcement, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "12.7 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. In case of any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved through mediation in Denver, Colorado (USA). If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may pursue litigation in the courts of California. The prevailing party in any litigation will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.",
                "explanation": "The original clause mandates arbitration in Colorado. The modified version mandates mediation in Colorado and then allows litigation in California if mediation fails. This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the required dispute resolution method, leading to potential disputes over jurisdiction and procedure.",

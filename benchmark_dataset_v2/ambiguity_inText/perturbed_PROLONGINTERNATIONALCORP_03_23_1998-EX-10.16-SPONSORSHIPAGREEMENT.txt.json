                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the payment of appearance fees for the drivers. Initially, the contract implied that after the initial 5 appearances, Prolong would only be responsible for travel expenses, and Sabco Drivers allow their image to be used for commercial purposes at no additional cost. The modified version states that Prolong is 'solely responsible for appearance fees to each driver, in addition to covering all travel expenses', which conflicts with the no additional cost clause for driver endorsements, creating ambiguity about payment terms.",

During the term of this Agreement, Sabco will make its best effort to not ----------- represent or accept as a primary sponsor any other company directly competitive with Prolong products. However, Sabco reserves the right to represent other secondary or associate sponsors regardless of their relation to Prolong products.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement strictly prohibits Sabco from representing any sponsor deemed competitive with Prolong. The modified version weakens this exclusivity by only focusing on primary sponsors and explicitly allowing Sabco to represent secondary and associate sponsors even if they are competitors. This creates a contradiction because Prolong might believe they have complete exclusivity in their product category, but Sabco can now partner with competitors as secondary or associate sponsors, undermining the perceived exclusivity.",

Sabco shall provide at its expense and maintain throughout --------- the term of this Agreement and any option period spectator liability insurance in an amount not less than $1 million single limit coverage with respect to any liability relating to the activities of Sabco in the performance of this Agreement. Sabco shall, within 90 days of the execution of this Agreement, supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 10 days written notice to Prolong.",
                "changed_text": "11. Insurance. Sabco shall provide at its expense and maintain throughout --------- the term of this Agreement and any option period spectator liability insurance. The specific amount of coverage will be determined by Sabco's internal risk assessment, with respect to any liability relating to the activities of Sabco in the performance of this Agreement. Sabco shall supply Prolong with a copy of such policy of insurance or a certificate thereof, and such policies shall be cancelable only upon 10 days written notice to Prolong.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the insurance requirement was clearly defined at '$1 million single limit coverage'. The modified version removes the explicit dollar amount and replaces it with a vague reference to Sabco's 'internal risk assessment'. This creates a conflict because Prolong could assume the insurance coverage remains at $1 million, while Sabco has the discretion to set a lower amount based on their assessment. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes if an incident occurs and the insurance coverage is inadequate compared to the initially understood amount.",

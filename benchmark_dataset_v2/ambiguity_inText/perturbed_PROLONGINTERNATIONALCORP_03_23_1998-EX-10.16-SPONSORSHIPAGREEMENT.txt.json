                "original_text": "Sabco shall provide unto Prolong five aggregate driver appearances (2) two-hours each at no fee. Prolong shall be responsible for all first class travel expenses relating to each driver appearance, i.e. hotel, airfare, meals, etc.  Additional appearances by Sabco drivers shall be at the discounted rate of [ * ] ($[ * ]) Dollars per day per driver, [ * ].",
                "changed_text": "Sabco shall provide unto Prolong five aggregate driver appearances (2) two-hours each at no fee, with Prolong being responsible for a flat fee of $[*] to cover all expenses.  Additional appearances by Sabco drivers shall be at the discounted rate of [ * ] ($[ * ]) Dollars per day per driver, inclusive of all travel and accommodation costs, payable directly to Sabco.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Prolong is responsible for 'all first class travel expenses' while the changed text introduces a 'flat fee' for the initial 5 appearances. It also contradicts itself by stating that additional appearances are at a discounted rate AND that the fee is inclusive of travel and accommodation costs 'payable directly to Sabco', implying Sabco will handle all additional appearance fees instead of Prolong directly.",

Sabco is free to partner with companies that offer similar services, but do not directly compete in the Super Lubricant market.",
                "explanation": "The original text broadly prohibits Sabco from representing any competitor. The modified text limits the restriction to 'primary' sponsors and introduces ambiguity by narrowing the competitive scope to only Prolong's 'Super Lubricant product line'. This allows Sabco to partner with companies offering related, but slightly different, products or services, creating a conflict if 'Prolong products' are later defined more broadly.",

This sponsorship fee of $ [ * ] shall be paid to Sabco in the following installments:  Year One (1998): $ [ * ] (four  equal installments of  $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/98, 6/15/98, 8/15/98 and  10/15/98); Year Two (1999): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be  paid on 3/15/99, 6/15/99, 8/15/99 and 10/15/99); Year Three (year-2000): $ [ * ] (four equal installments of $ [ * ] to be paid on 3/15/2000, 6/15/2000,8/15/2000 and 10/15/2000).",

Payment shall be made annually, with the first installment of $[*] due on 3/15/98. Subsequent installments are subject to performance metrics outlined in Schedule C, which may reduce the total amount paid.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a fixed total payment amount and a detailed installment schedule. The revised text references 'Schedule B' (which doesn't exist in the provided document) and introduces 'Schedule C' which outlines performance metrics that affect the total payment. This directly contradicts the fixed payment terms and introduces significant uncertainty about the actual amount Prolong is obligated to pay. The performance metrics can cause contradiction because the contract does not state what those metrics are. Therefore, a payment schedule is created that is dependent on outside factors.",

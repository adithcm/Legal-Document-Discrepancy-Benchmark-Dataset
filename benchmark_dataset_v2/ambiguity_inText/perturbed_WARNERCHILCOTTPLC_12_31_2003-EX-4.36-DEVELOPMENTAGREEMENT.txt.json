For purposes of this definition,          the term \"control\" as applied to any Person, means the possession,          directly or indirectly, of at least fifty-one per cent (51%) of the          power to direct or cause the direction of the management of that          Person, whether&sbsp;through ownership of voting securities or otherwise.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'control' is changed in the context of assignability. One section uses 51% ownership of voting securities as the criterion for control while another part of the contract uses 25%. This contradiction creates uncertainty when determining if a party can assign the contract due to an affiliate's control.",

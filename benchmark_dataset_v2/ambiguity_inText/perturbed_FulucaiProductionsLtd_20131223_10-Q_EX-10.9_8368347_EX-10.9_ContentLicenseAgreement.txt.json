                "original_text": "For the License Term and within the Licensed Territory, Producer hereby grants to ConvergTV a right and license to Distribute the program, file or video listed on the Deal Terms above (the \"Program\") consisting of (check one) ¨ episodes (series) or x one-offs, for unlimited runs for the License Term through ConvergTV channels and/or other distribution outlets, in accordance with the License Rights. The terms \"License Term\", \"Licensed Rights\", and \"Licensed Territory\" shall have the meaning specified in the Deal Terms above, which such Deal Terms are part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated herein by reference. As used in this Agreement and this license, the term \"Distribute\" includes, but is not limited to, any and all License Rights specified in the Deal Terms, all rights of distribution, the right to copy and reproduce the Program, the right to create derivative works of the Program for the purpose of creating branding elements and short form promotional materials (\"Promotional Works\"), the right to sell copies, the right to import and export the Program and the Promotional Works, the right to display the Program and Promotional Works publicity, the right to transmit the Program and Promotional Works through any transmission or delivery method that exists today, or that is created in the future, to any number of devices or users, including transmission through simultaneous delivery or streaming, and the right to sublicense and/or assign some or all of these rights to others.",

                "explanation": "The definition of 'Distribute' has been narrowed to ONLY transmission or delivery, removing the rights to copy, reproduce, create derivative works, sell, import/export, display publicly and sublicense. This conflicts with the later clauses that assume ConvergTV has those rights, creating ambiguity about the actual scope of distribution rights.",

                "changed_text": "Producer agrees that ConvergTV has the right, but not necessarily the exclusive right, to exercise the rights granted to it under this Agreement with respect to the Program, including those in Section 1, within the Licensed Territory. Producer retains the right to license the program to a third-party after a 60-day written notice.",
                "explanation": "This weakens the exclusivity clause. Section 4 originally granted ConvergTV *exclusive* distribution rights. The modified text allows the Producer to potentially license the program to other parties, directly contradicting the exclusivity originally granted and creating conflict over who has rights to Distribute.",

                "changed_text": "Producer is not obligated to take action against copyright infringement, ConvergTV, at its sole discretion, may pursue legal action if needed. Producer will cooperate with ConvergTV to provide documentation to ConvergTV upon the demand from ConvergTV.",
                "explanation": "Section 8(a) placed the *obligation* on the Producer to protect copyrights. The changed text removes this obligation and places responsibility on ConvergTV, and makes it discretionary and on demand, creating a contradictory situation regarding copyright enforcement.",

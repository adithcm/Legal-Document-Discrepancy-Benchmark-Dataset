For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no cross- collateralization of the Royalties collected from Licensee's sale, license, distribution or other exploitation of the Wireless Products derived from the Property \"ICE AGE 2\", with the Royalties collected from any other Wireless Products released by Licensee under this Agreement.",

The modified text changes this right to be at Fox's discretion of allowing the Licensee to do it.

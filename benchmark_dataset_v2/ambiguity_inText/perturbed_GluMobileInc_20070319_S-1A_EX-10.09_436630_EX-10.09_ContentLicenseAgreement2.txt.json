For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee's right and license to develop and distribute the Game in connection with the Property \"ICE AGE 2\" shall become non-exclusive after December 31, 2006.",

Licensee's right and license to develop and distribute the Game in connection with the Property \"ICE AGE 2\" shall remain exclusive indefinitely, notwithstanding the previous sentence.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states the game license becomes non-exclusive after a specific date. The modified text contradicts this by stating the game license remains exclusive indefinitely, creating a direct conflict regarding the exclusivity of the game license after December 31, 2006. This could lead to disputes about who has the right to distribute the game after that date.",

The modified text contradicts this by stating that Fox shall not deduct any distribution fee at all, creating conflicting instructions regarding whether a distribution fee should be applied.

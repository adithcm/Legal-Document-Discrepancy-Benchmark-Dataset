                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by initially including confidential and proprietary information, including trade secrets, within the definition of 'Intellectual Property,' but then specifically excluding trade secrets in subsection (e). This creates uncertainty about whether trade secrets are actually considered intellectual property under the agreement and whether they are covered by different clauses of the agreement.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.",

The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group to any party, without restrictions, for any reason. Parent shall have no obligations to enforce any breaches of license or notify SpinCo of violations.",
                "explanation": "The original text grants a non-exclusive license, but restricts transfer and sublicensing to only Permitted Parties and subjects such parties to confidentiality obligations, with a requirement for Parent to enforce breaches and notify SpinCo. The modified version completely removes these restrictions, granting Parent unfettered rights to transfer/sublicense the license to any party without confidentiality requirements or obligations to enforce or notify. This directly contradicts the original intention and potentially undermines the value of the Licensed SpinCo IP.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies that SpinCo indemnifies Parent against all SpinCo IP Liabilities. The modification then adds 'except those arising from breach of contract', creating a direct contradiction. This makes it ambiguous as to whether Parent is indemnified from the SpinCo breach of contract IP Liabilities. This modification introduces uncertainty over a core risk allocation mechanism between the parties.",

                "explanation": "The first definition includes both the USA and Canada, while the second one restricts the ‘Territory’ to the USA only. This leads to confusion about whether the agreement applies to Canada or not.",

Zanotti shall notify Aura in writing of any such MFN Terms within fifteen (15) calendar days after agreeing thereto, and shall make the MFN Terms available to Aura as of the effective date of such agreement and thereafter for the greater of (i) three (3) months or (ii) such time that the MFN Terms remain in effect.",

Zanotti shall notify Aura in writing of any such MFN Terms within thirty (30) calendar days after agreeing thereto, and shall make the MFN Terms available to Aura as of the effective date of such agreement and thereafter for the lesser of (i) three (3) months or (ii) such time that the MFN Terms remain in effect.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires notification within fifteen (15) days and 'greater of' the time period. The changed text requires notification within thirty (30) days and the 'lesser of' the time period. This contradiction makes it unclear within what time Zanotti is obligated to inform Aura of the MFN terms and for how long Aura can benefit from it.",

                "explanation": "The original text requires 90 days notice for non-renewal, but the revised text requires only 30 days notice. This directly contradicts the original term, creating uncertainty regarding the required notice period for terminating the agreement.",

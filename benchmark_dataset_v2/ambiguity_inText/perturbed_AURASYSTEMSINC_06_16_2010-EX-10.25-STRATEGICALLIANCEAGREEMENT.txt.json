Confidential Information does not, however, include any information which the recipient can establish (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the discloser; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the discloser to recipient through no fault or breach of recipient; (iii) is already in the possession of recipient without restriction on use or disclosure at the time of disclosure by discloser as shown by recipient's files and records prior to the time of the\n\n\n\ndisclosure; (iv) is obtained by recipient lawfully and without restriction on use or disclosure from a third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by recipient without use of or reference to discloser's Confidential Information, as shown by recipient's files and records.",

                "explanation": "Removing the clause \", provided, however, that such default has not been remedied by Zanotti within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice thereof from Aura\" from section 7.2(b) would mean Aura can terminate the agreement immediately if Zanotti fails to meet minimum purchase requirements, regardless of whether Zanotti fixes the issue within 60 days. This contradicts the principle of providing a cure period for breaches, potentially conflicting with general contract law principles implied elsewhere in the document.",

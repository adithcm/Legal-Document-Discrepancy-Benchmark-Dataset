                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Territory.' Initially, it unambiguously included all GCC states. The modification excludes Bahrain for Direct Access/EAP, potentially creating confusion regarding SCIEN's rights and obligations in Bahrain under different sections of the agreement. This ambiguity can lead to disputes over market access and sales territories.",

All purchase orders are final.",
                "changed_text": "SCIEN shall pay HEMISPHERX for each order of Product within 75 days after receipt of the goods except for the for first purchase order which will be for 50 vials of Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) (\"First Order\") and paid within 30 days of receipt. All subsequent purchase orders are subject to MOH approval for Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived) on 5 MERS patients before payment. All purchase orders are final.",
                "explanation": "The conflicting text now states that the first order should be paid within 30 days of receipt, contradicting the initial condition of payment upon MOH approval. This internal inconsistency creates confusion regarding the payment terms for the first order and introduces new conditions for subsequent purchases that were not initially stated. It is unclear when the subsequent order can be paid to HEMISPHERX.",

                "explanation": "By changing the term limit from 5 to 2 years, there is now confusion on what amount of time is the actual Confidentiality term. This introduces internal contradiction and allows the party to get away with sharing confidential information earlier.",

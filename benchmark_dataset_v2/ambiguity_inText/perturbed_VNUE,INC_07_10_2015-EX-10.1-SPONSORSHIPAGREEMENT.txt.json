                "original_text": "The Sponsor will have 15 days from receipt of the Notice to accept the terms to be the category sponsor of the 2014 Event. If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",

If the Sponsor decides not to be the category sponsor of the 2016 Event or fails to timely respond to the Notice, then ANTHEMIC may approach other parties to be the category sponsor.",
                "explanation": "The original text mistakenly references '2014 Event' instead of '2016 Event' in the first sentence creating an internal contradiction. The intention is clearly to discuss the 2016 event since the entire section revolves around future sponsorship for the year 2016. This generates potential confusion over whether the sponsor has the right of first refusal for the immediate next year or if there's a historical reference which makes no sense in context.",

This post-event email blast will go out to tall ANTHEMIC and FLOOD Magazine RSVP's, as well as our FLOOD Magazine's national newsletter list of roughly 100,000 recipients.",
                "changed_text": "Formal blast date will be dependent upon turn-around time of content from VNUE (maximum ANTHEMIC/ FLOOD Magazine turnaround time = VNUE content delivery date+7 days). This post-event email blast will go out to a limited number of ANTHEMIC and FLOOD Magazine RSVP's, as well as a small subset of our FLOOD Magazine's national newsletter list.",
                "explanation": "The modification introduces ambiguity regarding the recipient pool for the post-event email blast. Originally, it was intended for 'all' RSVP's and a newsletter list of 'roughly 100,000 recipients'. The edited sentence restricts the recipient pool to 'a limited number' of RSVP's and 'a small subset' of the newsletter list, without defining the 'limited number' or the 'small subset'. This creates a contradiction between the intended reach and the actual execution, impacting the value of the sponsorship.",

                "original_text": "ANTHEMIC may use the Sponsor's name, logo, and other identifying characteristics on merchandise related to the Event, and the Sponsor is not entitled to any compensation from the sale of such merchandise. The right to use the Sponsor's name, logo and other identifying characteristics in connection with merchandise for the 2015 Event survives termination of this Agreement. After termination of this Agreement, ANTHEMIC may not design new merchandise that includes the Sponsor's name, logo, or other identifying characteristics for the 2015 Event but may produce additional previously designed and approved merchandise.",
                "changed_text": "ANTHEMIC may use the Sponsor's name, logo, and other identifying characteristics on merchandise related to the Event, and the Sponsor is entitled to compensation from the sale of such merchandise, as agreed upon separately in Exhibit B. The right to use the Sponsor's name, logo and other identifying characteristics in connection with merchandise for the 2015 Event survives termination of this Agreement. After termination of this Agreement, ANTHEMIC may design new merchandise that includes the Sponsor's name, logo, or other identifying characteristics for the 2015 Event and may produce additional previously designed and approved merchandise.",
                "explanation": "This change directly contradicts the original terms by stating that the sponsor IS entitled to compensation (referred in Exhibit B, which is not defined anywhere), and ANTHEMIC CAN design new merchandise post-termination. This creates significant uncertainty regarding the financial implications and creative control, potentially leading to disputes about royalty distribution and brand representation after the agreement ends.",

                "original_text": "2.2 Inventory.\n\nDuring the Term, Medica shall at all times maintain as safety stock that quantity of Cartridges equal to one (1) times the monthly average number of Cartridges ordered by Vapotherm during the immediately preceding [* * *] months.",
                "changed_text": "2.2 Inventory.\n\nDuring the Term, Medica should endeavor to maintain as safety stock that quantity of Cartridges equal to a reasonable estimate of the monthly average number of Cartridges. The specifics of this stock will be determined with good faith discussions between both parties and amended to this document as Exhibit F.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Medica 'shall' maintain a specific level of safety stock. The modified text weakens this obligation by using 'should endeavor' and introduces ambiguity by not defining what a reasonable estimate is, or what happens until Exhibit F is added.  This contradiction creates uncertainty about Medica's inventory obligations.",

If Vapotherm does not notify Medica that one or more Cartridges do not meet the Specifications or otherwise fail to comply with this Agreement, those Cartridges will be deemed to have been accepted by Vapotherm as being fully compliant with the Specifications and this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "4.5 Acceptance of Cartridges. Even if Vapotherm does not notify Medica that one or more Cartridges do not meet the Specifications or otherwise fail to comply with this Agreement, Vapotherm retains the right to lodge a future claim if the non-conformity was not reasonably discoverable at the time of delivery.",
                "explanation": "The original states acceptance is automatic with no notification. The modified text introduces the idea of 'reasonably discoverable' defects and the right to future claims, even after deemed acceptance. This contradicts the concept of automatic acceptance upon delivery and creates ambiguity around the finality of acceptance.",

All rights and obligation decay after 5 (five) years from termination or expiration.",
                "explanation": "The original text states rights and obligations decay after 2 years from termination or expiration. The modified text changes to 5 years. This directly contradicts the previous statement creating a contradiction as to when rights and obligations from prior termination or expiration decay.",

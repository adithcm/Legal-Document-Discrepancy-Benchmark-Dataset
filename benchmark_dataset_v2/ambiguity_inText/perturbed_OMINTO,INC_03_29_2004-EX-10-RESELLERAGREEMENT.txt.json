Reseller may issue advertising at its sole discretion and MediaNet Group Technologies approval is not needed.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding who controls publicity. Originally, both parties agreed on press releases and MediaNet had approval over advertising. Now, the Reseller has sole discretion over press releases and advertising, contradicting the initial agreement and creating uncertainty.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation modifies the term 'renew'. Initially, both parties in writing need to agree within 30 days of license expiration, but the modified term states that either party written consent is enough to renew the agreement. It also introduces conflicting text about the obligation to remit payments to Reseller, initially cease 30 days after termination of this Agreement, but the modified version states that the obligation to remit payment continue until all buyers end their subscription. This introduces ambiguity about how long does the obligation continues.",

                "original_text": "21. DEDICATED RATES\n\nA shipper who has executed a TSA that has Dedicated Product shall be referred to herein as a \"Dedicated Shipper.\" As provided in its TSA, a Dedicated Shipper shall be entitled to the applicable Dedicated Rate set out in Section I of this Tariff. A Shipper that is not an Incentive Shipper or Dedicated Shipper shall pay the applicable Uncommitted Rate set out in Section I of this Tariff.",
                "changed_text": "21. DEDICATED RATES\n\nA shipper who has executed a TSA that has Dedicated Product shall be referred to herein as a \"Dedicated Shipper.\" As provided in its TSA, a Dedicated Shipper shall be entitled to the applicable Dedicated Rate set out in Section I of this Tariff, *only if* the market price is 10% higher than the rate. A Shipper that is not an Incentive Shipper or Dedicated Shipper shall pay the applicable Uncommitted Rate set out in Section I of this Tariff.",
                "explanation": "The addition of 'only if the market price is 10% higher than the rate' introduces a conditional element to the entitlement of the Dedicated Rate. This directly contradicts the original text, which states a Dedicated Shipper *shall* be entitled to the Dedicated Rate as provided in the TSA without such conditions. It's now unclear when a shipper will pay the applicable rate, creating potential disputes over what constitutes a Dedicated Shipper and associated rates.",

                "explanation": "Section 8.A originally specified measurements according to A.P.I. standards, which provides an industry-standard and objective methodology. The modification states that Carrier relies on 'internal Carrier guidelines, unless otherwise dictated by the Shipper,' which is a direct contradiction. Additionally, the allocation methodology has been altered so now losses will be equally allocated instead of proportional to total volumes. This change is contradictory to the original pro-rata approach.",

Product for shipment through the System will be received only on a properly executed Nomination from Shipper or its designee showing the Receipt Point at which the Product is to be received, the Delivery Point of the shipment, Consignee (if any), and the amount of Product to be transported. Carrier may refuse to accept Product for transportation unless satisfactory evidence is furnished that Shipper or Consignee has made provision for prompt receipt thereof at the Delivery Point. Carrier shall not be obligated to accept Product for transportation during any calendar month, unless Shipper or its designee makes such Nomination to Carrier in writing on or before 9:00 a.m., prevailing Central Time of the tenth (10th) Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the month during which the transportation under the Nomination is to begin.",
                "changed_text": "5. NOMINATIONS AND SCHEDULING:\n\nA. Product for shipment through the System will be received based on verbal agreements between the Shipper or its designee and the Carrier's scheduling department. Formal Nominations are not required. Carrier is obligated to accept Product for transportation during any calendar month, even if the Shipper or its designee fails to submit any nomination. ",
                "explanation": "The original text requires a 'properly executed Nomination' and specifies a deadline for submission. The modified text eliminates this requirement, stating that 'Formal Nominations are not required,' and makes the Carrier obligated to accept product without nominations. This is a direct contradiction of the original process and could lead to scheduling chaos and disputes about volumes and delivery.",

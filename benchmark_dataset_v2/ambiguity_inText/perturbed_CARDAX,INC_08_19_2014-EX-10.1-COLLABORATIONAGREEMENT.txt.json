                "original_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means a Party's reasonable efforts and diligence, consistent with professional business standards generally practiced in the health and nutrition industry, applied in accordance with the Party's commercially reasonable business, legal, medical and scientific judgment, including the efforts and resources the Party would use for a product owned by it or to which it has rights, which is of similar market potential at a similar stage in its product life, taking into account the competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position of the compound, the Applicable Laws, the profitability of the applicable products, and other relevant factors including, without limitation, technical, legal, scientific or medical factors.",
                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means a Party's reasonable efforts, not necessarily consistent with professional business standards generally practiced in the health and nutrition industry, applied in accordance with the Party's good faith business judgment. This definition does not require the Party to expend efforts or resources beyond what it deems minimally necessary.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' introduces a contradiction by removing the requirement for consistency with industry standards and allowing for a lower level of effort. This conflicts with other sections of the contract that may rely on the original, more stringent definition, creating uncertainty in enforcement.",

CAPSUGEL shall keep true, accurate, and complete books, records, reports, and accounts (hereinafter \"Records\") of all business or activities in connection with or relating to the manufacture, storage, handling, and shipment, including all validations, qualification, and validation protocols, of Product and this Agreement. CARDAX has the right, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to inspect and examine such Records. CAPSUGEL agrees to retain all such Records for a period of five (5) years after the expiration of the Term or after termination of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "6.5 Recordkeeping. CAPSUGEL shall keep books, records, reports, and accounts (hereinafter \"Records\") of all business or activities in connection with or relating to the manufacture of Product. CAPSUGEL is required to retain such Records only as long as it deems necessary for its internal purposes, not exceeding two (2) years after the product is released in the market. CARDAX will not be able to inspect the records of CAPSUGEL.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Recordkeeping' introduces a contradiction by changing the duration of retention, removing required elements and barring CARDAX from inspecting the records. This directly conflicts with the previous requirement of accurate and complete maintenance for five years, leading to ambiguity on which record-keeping standard is enforced.",

A material breach that is subject to cure that is not cured within [***] of written notice of breach shall be cause for termination, provided that if the breaching party is diligently pursuing in good faith the remedy of the breach at the expiration of such [***] cure period, then such [***] cure period shall be extended for a reasonable period to effect the cure. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as of the date of such termination.",
                "changed_text": "10.2 Termination for Breach . A breach, regardless of materiality or curability, may be cause for termination at the sole discretion of the non-breaching party. There is no requirement to provide written notice or opportunity to cure. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall not be permitted to use any Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall not be permitted to use any Intellectual Property of CARDAX.",
                "explanation": "The modified definition of 'Termination for Breach' introduces a contradiction by removing the cure period, removing a written notice as mandatory and expanding the grounds for termination to any breach, regardless of materiality. This conflicts with the original clause that demands materiality and a cure period, thus creating a strong contradiction regarding the termination conditions of the contract. Additionally, both CAPSUGEL and CARDAX are not permitted to use each other's IP.",

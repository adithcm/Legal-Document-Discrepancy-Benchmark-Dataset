Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity may use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and may undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund irrespective of whether it has received purchase orders, to ensure continuous availability of shares to potential investors.",
                "explanation": "Original text mandates Integrity to solicit orders using 'best efforts' and order shares only upon receiving purchase orders, the modified text changes this to a discretionary action with the use of 'may' and also removes the condition that the fund must receive purchase orders before ordering shares creating ambiguity on the obligation and the basis for ordering shares.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares. Distribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.8 Integrity will bear a portion of the expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity may include expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities intended to result in the sale of Shares. The Fund will cover all expenses related to (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares. Distribution expenses shall include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "explanation": "Original text clearly states Integrity bears 'all' distribution expenses, whereas the modified version shifts the responsibility of categories (a)-(f) under distribution expenses to the Fund, creating conflict on who bears which expense. It changes 'shall not include' to 'shall include' at the end, reversing the meaning of what can be reimbursed.",

                "explanation": "The first change removes the second condition of the original text, that the agreement must be approved by the Qualified Trustees.

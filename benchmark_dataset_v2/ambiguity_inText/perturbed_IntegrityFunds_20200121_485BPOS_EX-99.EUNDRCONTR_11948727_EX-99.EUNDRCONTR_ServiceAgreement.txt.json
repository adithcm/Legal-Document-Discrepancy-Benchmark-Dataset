                "original_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares, with the understanding that ultimate success is not guaranteed. Integrity will undertake advertising and promotion as deemed necessary, but with no fixed budget. Integrity may order Shares from the Fund at its discretion, regardless of whether purchase orders have been received.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies 'best efforts' and ordering shares only upon receiving purchase orders. The modified version introduces ambiguity by changing 'best efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts,' removing the guarantee of success and grants Integrity discretion on share ordering. This contradicts the original intent and obligations for Share sales/orders.",

For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2 Source: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020 (f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares. Distribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 1.8 Integrity will bear distribution expenses as determined in a separate agreement with the Fund. 'Distribution expenses' include costs associated with selling shares as agreed upon by Integrity and the Fund's investment advisor. The Fund will reimburse Integrity for certain pre-approved marketing expenses, including direct mail and advertising campaigns. Integrity will not be responsible for expenses related to shareholder services, which the Fund will directly manage.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies that Integrity bears all distribution expenses and provides a detailed list. The modified text introduces a separate agreement for determining distribution expenses, allows for Fund reimbursement of pre-approved marketing expenses, and shifts responsibility for shareholder service expenses to the Fund. This conflicts with the original clause and may lead to financial disputes.",

                "original_text": "Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund's Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan, in this Agreement, or any agreement related to the Plan (the \"Qualified Trustees\"), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).",

Renewal requires written consent from Integrity and informal discussion with at least one member of the Fund's Board. This Agreement is terminable by either party with 30 days written notice. In case of assignment or change of control, the agreement may be subject to additional review by legal counsel before automatic termination.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates specific annual approvals by the Board of Trustees and Qualified Trustees for automatic renewal and specifies termination notice periods. The modified text simplifies renewal to written consent from Integrity and informal discussions. It shortens termination notice to 30 days for both parties and introduces ambiguity regarding termination upon assignment or change of control, which now requires legal review, creating conflicting terms.",

                "original_text": "Employees of Federated Advisory Services Company provide support to portfolio managers and other employees of affiliated advisers. Such services may include development of risk management programs, production of portfolio and compliance reports for clients and/or fund Boards, coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration, completion of required broker and custody documentation, development and documentation of operational procedures, coordination of proxy voting activities, on-site support of hardware and software, etc.",

                "explanation": "The original text uses \"may include\", suggesting the services are optional. The modified text uses \"are required to provide\" and \"include\", making the services mandatory. This creates a contradiction because if another part of the agreement states that certain services are at FASC's discretion, this change would create ambiguity in enforcement.",

The Services Agreement, as amended by this Amendment with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, shall remain in full force and effect. The Services Agreement also shall remain in full force and effect without amendment with respect to Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act.",

The Services Agreement, as amended by this Amendment with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, shall remain in full force and effect. The Services Agreement also shall remain in full force and effect without amendment with respect to Accounts that are investment companies under the 1940 Act.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the amendment is effective upon execution and delivery by *each* party, implying both parties must fulfill these actions. The modified text states it's effective upon execution and delivery by *either* party. This creates an inconsistency about when the amendment actually becomes active, potentially impacting legal obligations and timelines.",

                "explanation": "The original text dictates Pennsylvania law governs the amendment, while the modified text dictates Delaware law. This creates direct legal conflict and ambiguity since the choice of law is fundamental to contract interpretation and enforcement.",

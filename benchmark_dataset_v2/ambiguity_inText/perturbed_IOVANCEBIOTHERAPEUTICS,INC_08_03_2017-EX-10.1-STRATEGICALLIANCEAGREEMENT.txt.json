                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction. The original text states that MD Anderson must comply with LBIO's written instructions, as long as they do not conflict with applicable laws or the agreement itself. This modification gives MD Anderson's internal policies precedence over LBIO's instructions. This introduces ambiguity, as it is unclear which guidance takes priority when LBIO's instructions and MD Anderson's internal policies conflict, even when the written instructions do not go against existing laws or the initial agreement. This creates an uncertainty in the standards to enforce.",

The modified version directly contradicts this by saying that termination *does* release parties from those same obligations.

                "original_text": "TL may purchase from Integrity limited quantities of the Product for its promotional use, at the Manufacturing cost set forth in paragraph 3(a) above, provided the quantity of such purchases does not exceed seven percent (7%) of the total royalty bearing units of such Product title purchased by TL, TL warrants that any units so purchased, whether or not labeled \"promotional only\" or cut-out, will be given away for purposes of promotion of the Products, and will not be sold. If for any reason, Integrity and TL are subject to lower \"free goods\" limits by any third party license, the foregoing shall be adjusted to comply with any such license(s).",
                "changed_text": "TL may purchase from Integrity unlimited quantities of the Product for its promotional use, at a price to be determined by mutual agreement, TL makes no warranty regarding the use of purchased units, and may sell, give away, or otherwise distribute them as TL sees fit, with no restrictions whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "The original text limits TL's promotional purchases to 7% of royalty-bearing units, restricts their use to promotional giveaways, and prohibits sales. The modified text removes all these restrictions, allowing unlimited purchases, sales, and unrestricted use, creating a direct contradiction.",

Sharing will occur on a 'best efforts' basis, and the value or type of names exchanged is not specified. TL has no obligation to supply Integrity with data on former subscribers to its \"Songs 4 Life\" series.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a mutual exchange of mailing list data of equal value, with TL specifically required to provide data on former subscribers.

                "original_text": "Accounting statements and, if applicable, royalty payments for products sold will be rendered by each party quarterly within sixty (60) days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Only products which have been paid or credited to the account of the seller shall be deemed sold. No royalties will be payable on the sales of any products by any third-party distributors or licensees until such time as accountings and payment or final credit therefor has been received by the paying party. Either party, at its sole expense, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice (and not more than once in respect of any accounting period) will have the right to inspect the other party's books regarding the obligations hereunder for a period of two (2) years from the date on which any statement is rendered. Such auditing party must make specific written objection within such two (2) year period. Thereafter, it will be deemed to have consented to any such statements or accountings which will then be considered an account stated as between the parties, not subject to any objection for any reason whatsoever. Provided the objecting party has made timely written objection, as aforesaid, such party may file an action regarding same within two (2) years and six (6) months after the applicable statement is rendered, after which time any such action will be deemed barred.",

Products are deemed sold when shipped, regardless of payment status. Royalties on third-party sales are payable immediately. Neither party has the right to inspect the other party's books or records. All accounting statements are considered preliminary and subject to revision indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The original section mandates quarterly accountings, defines 'sold' as paid/credited, delays royalties on third-party sales until payment is received, allows audits with a two-year objection window, and sets a statute of limitations for claims. The modified text removes these requirements, making the accounting schedule flexible, redefining 'sold' as shipped, making royalties immediately payable, prohibiting audits, and preventing finality of accountings.",

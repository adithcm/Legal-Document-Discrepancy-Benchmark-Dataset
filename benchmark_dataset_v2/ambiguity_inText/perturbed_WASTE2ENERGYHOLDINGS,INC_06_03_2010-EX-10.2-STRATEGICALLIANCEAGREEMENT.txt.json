                "changed_text": "Term has the meaning set out in Clause 3.1; 3 Territory shall mean the world.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines the Territory as the world excluding specific countries. The modified text removes the exclusion, effectively defining 'Territory' as the entire world. This creates a contradiction if other clauses refer to the original, restricted definition of 'Territory'.",

                "changed_text": "7.1 The Parties agree that they may, at their discretion, enter into a Manufacturing Agreement. The Manufacturing Agreement, if entered into, shall govern the cooperation and fulfillment of obligations related to W2E Equipment and SHBV Technologies. 7.2 The Parties are encouraged to negotiate the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement, but there is no strict deadline for doing so.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates the creation of a Manufacturing Agreement within a day. The modified text makes the agreement optional and removes the strict deadline. This creates ambiguity because other sections may assume a Manufacturing Agreement exists, leading to enforcement challenges if it doesn't.",

                "changed_text": "15.6 Each party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason whatsoever.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a condition for termination based on business levels outlined in Schedule 2 of the Manufacturing Agreement. The modified text introduces an unrestricted right to terminate the agreement at any time. This creates a contradiction as it voids the specific condition and introduces uncertainty in how termination rights are exercised, also relating to the fact that it could be argued the Manufacturing Agreement may not exist.",

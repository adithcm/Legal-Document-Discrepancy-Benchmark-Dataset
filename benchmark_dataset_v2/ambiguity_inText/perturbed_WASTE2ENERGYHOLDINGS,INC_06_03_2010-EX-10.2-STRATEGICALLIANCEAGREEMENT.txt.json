                "changed_text": "Affiliates means subsidiaries or other entities that will be mutually agreed in writing. For the avoidance of doubt, any entity controlled by a party is automatically considered an affiliate, regardless of written agreement.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Affiliates.' The original definition requires mutual written agreement, while the added sentence broadens the definition to include any entity controlled by a party, even without written agreement. This creates uncertainty regarding which entities qualify as affiliates and whether written agreement is always necessary.",

However, this clause shall not apply to contractors, who may be solicited freely.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction to the non-solicitation clause. Originally, the clause prevents soliciting both employees and contractors. The added sentence excludes contractors from this restriction, creating ambiguity regarding whether a contractor can be hired away and if it is considered a breach of contract.",

If the breach was unintentional, the other Party shall be given ninety (90) days to remedy the Breach from receipt of the first Party's written notice specifying the nature of the Breach and requesting that the same be remedied.",
                "explanation": "This change creates a contradiction in the termination clause. Initially, the clause dictates that if a 'Breach' is remediable, the breaching party receives 30 days to remedy it. However, the new text introduces the concept of intentional versus unintentional breaches. If a material breach is intentional, it can trigger immediate termination. But, it gives the breaching party 90 days to remedy the breach if the breach was unintentional. This introduces ambiguity about whether the breaching party actually receives 30 days to remedy the breach.",

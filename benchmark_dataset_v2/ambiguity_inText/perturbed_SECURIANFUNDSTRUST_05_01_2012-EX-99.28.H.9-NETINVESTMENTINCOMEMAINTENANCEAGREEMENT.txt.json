                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that the Investment Adviser *shall* waive its fee or reimburse the Fund. The modified text replaces 'shall' with 'may consider' and replaces 'sufficient to produce a Net Investment Income of zero' with 'sufficient to possibly produce a Net Investment Income nearing zero' making the obligation discretionary and the target outcome uncertain. This introduces ambiguity regarding the Investment Advisor's responsibility.",

The Investment Adviser *may* have the option to recover *a portion* of the amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense  Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds *a pre-determined threshold, subject to trustee approval*. In no event, however, shall  the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day *until* the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case  such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable *if mutually agreed upon by all parties*.

                "explanation": "The original text grants the Investment Adviser the option to recover the 'full amount' of the expense waiver. The modified version changes this to 'may have the option to recover *a portion*' and adds the vague concept of a 'pre-determined threshold, subject to trustee approval' and 'if mutually agreed upon by all parties', and changes 'shall' to 'might' again making the action uncertain. This creates a contradiction because it is unclear whether the Investment Advisor is entitled to full recovery, and introduces new conditions for recovery that were not previously present.",

                "explanation": "The original agreement clearly states that termination of the Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate this agreement, with a specific exception. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating the agreement 'may terminate' and adding 'potential' and 'pending further review', along with subjecting section 1.5 to further review, casting doubt on the termination clause's certainty, and creating uncertainty on if termination is automatic or requires more action. The section on the Investment Advisor's rights is also affected, creating a conflict.",

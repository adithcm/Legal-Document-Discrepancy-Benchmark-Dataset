                "explanation": "The original definition states that an 'Approved Merchant' must meet the criteria of the 'Merchant Processing Policy.' The modified definition removes this requirement and adds that the merchant must be actively processing transactions for at least 90 days. This creates a contradiction because a merchant could be considered 'Approved' under one definition but not the other, leading to uncertainty about which merchants are actually approved and bound by the terms applicable to approved merchants.",

                "changed_text": "ISO shall be responsible for a portion of credit and fraud losses associated with the Merchant Portfolio or the Program, specifically those losses resulting from ISO's negligence in underwriting. For any high risk Merchant who in good faith ISO anticipates will have annual Visa and MasterCard transaction volume equal to or greater than $[***] and any low risk Merchant who in good faith ISO anticipates will have annual Visa and MasterCard transaction volume equal to or greater than $[***], ISO shall advise SERVICERS and permit SERVICERS to conduct their own credit review prior to boarding the account.

                "explanation": "The original text places all responsibility for credit and fraud losses on ISO, regardless of SERVICERS' involvement. The modified text introduces a contradiction by stating that SERVICERS' decision to conduct their own credit review transfers the liability for such losses to SERVICERS. This creates ambiguity as to who bears the ultimate responsibility for credit and fraud losses, especially when SERVICERS are involved in the credit review process, which could lead to disputes over financial liability.",

In addition, ISO will provide any shareholder/owner personal financial information as required by the Rules. ISO will, at any and all reasonable times, permit SERVICERS' employees, agents and/or auditors to inspect ISO's books and records at SERVICERS' expense prior request and notice and if for a particular need.",

ISO is not required to provide any shareholder/owner personal financial information unless compelled by a court order. SERVICERS' employees, agents and/or auditors can conduct no more than 1 inspection per year for ISO's books and records, and such inspections are subject to a fee paid by SERVICERS.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires ISO to provide annual audited financial statements and also provide shareholder/owner personal financial information as required by the Rules, and permit SERVICERS to inspect ISO's books and records at any and all reasonable times. The modified version changes this by stating that ISO is not required to provide any shareholder/owner personal financial information unless compelled by court order and SERVICERS can conduct only 1 inspection per year, which are subject to a fee paid by SERVICERS. These requirements conflict with the more flexible language of the first excerpt. The changes introduced makes it unclear what the standards are regarding how ISO must turn over private financial data and other records, making enforcement of those standards subject to interpretation.",

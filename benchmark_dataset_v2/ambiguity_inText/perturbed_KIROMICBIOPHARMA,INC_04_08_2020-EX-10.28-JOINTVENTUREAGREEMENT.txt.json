                "original_text": "The Parties may withdraw from this JV only for serious and justified reasons or by mutual consent. The withdrawal must be exercised by written notice, to be sent to the other Party by certified letter or PEC, with minimum notice of 30 days.\n\nWithdrawal or termination by mutual consent shall only have effect for the future and shall not affect the part of the Agreement already executed.\n\nIn case of withdrawal according to the previous paragraph, Kiromic is obliged to cover Molipharma for the expenses incurred and for those committed, related to the research programs being developed, until receipt of the notice of withdrawal.",
                "changed_text": "The Parties may withdraw from this JV only for serious and justified reasons or by mutual consent. The withdrawal must be exercised by written notice, to be sent to the other Party by certified letter or PEC, with minimum notice of 30 days.\n\nWithdrawal or termination by mutual consent shall have immediate effect, nullifying all prior obligations and executed parts of the Agreement.\n\nIn case of withdrawal according to the previous paragraph, neither Kiromic nor Molipharma is obligated to cover any expenses incurred or committed related to the research programs being developed following the withdrawal.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a direct contradiction regarding the effects of withdrawal. The original text states withdrawal only affects future obligations and requires Kiromic to cover expenses until notice, whereas the modified text states withdrawal has immediate effect nullifying all prior obligations with neither Kiromic nor Molipharma obligated to cover any expenses, creating uncertainty about financial responsibilities upon withdrawal.",

                "changed_text": "Each Party recognizes and acknowledges that it is obliged to comply with the Anti-Corruption Rules. However, such compliance is subject to the Party's own internal interpretation of said rules.\n\nKiromic acknowledges receipt of a copy of MOLIPHARMA's Anti-Corruption Policies but makes no warranty as to the comparability of its own Anti-Corruption Policies.\n\nEach Party warrants and undertakes to the other that: (a) it has not, to its actual knowledge, violated any applicable Anti-Corruption Rules. This warranty is limited to actions directly authorized by the current directors, managers, and officers. Any actions by former personnel or Associated Persons are expressly excluded from this warranty.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces conflict by weakening the commitment to Anti-Corruption Rules. The original text mandates compliance and asserts comparable policies and no past violations. The modified text introduces subjectivity by linking compliance to internal interpretation, disclaims warranty of comparable policies and limits the warranty of compliance by restricting its scope to current actions and direct authorization. This creates uncertainty about adherence to Anti-Corruption Rules, allowing either party to potentially claim compliance based on a self-serving interpretation.",

                "original_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Any such arbitration shall (i) be subject to the application of the Italian Law, (ii) take place in Paris, France and (iii) be conducted in English.\n\nEach of the parties to this Agreement consents to personal jurisdiction for any emergency injunction sought in the Court of Rome. However, subsequent to the emergency injunction hearing, the merits of the matter will be decided by the ICC as per the procedure set forth above.",
                "changed_text": "All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be initially addressed through mediation. If mediation fails, disputes will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Any such arbitration shall (i) be subject to the application of the Italian Law, (ii) take place in Paris, France and (iii) be conducted in English.\n\nEach of the parties to this Agreement consents to personal jurisdiction for any emergency injunction sought in either the Court of Rome or the courts of Houston, Texas, at the plaintiff's discretion. Subsequent proceedings will be decided by the court chosen for the emergency injunction hearing.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies ICC arbitration as the sole method for dispute resolution, while the modified text adds a mandatory mediation step before arbitration. Furthermore, the original text indicates that only the Court of Rome is permitted for the emergency injunction and once it is completed, the matter must be resolved via ICC. The modified version expands where the emergency injunction could be located to Rome, Italy or Houston, TX at plaintiff's decision and further dictates that subsequent proceedings will be located at the court that held the hearing. This introduces contradiction by suggesting two distinct methods for dispute resolution and creating uncertainty about which forum has ultimate jurisdiction.",

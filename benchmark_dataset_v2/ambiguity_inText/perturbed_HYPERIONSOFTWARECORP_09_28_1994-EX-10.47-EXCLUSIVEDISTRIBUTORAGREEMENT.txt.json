Such services will be provided at the local billing rate or such alternative billing rate as shall be agreed between the parties. The party providing the support shall receive all revenues arising therefrom unless otherwise agreed. Furthermore, it is understood that travel expenses, if any, are to be borne by the client utilizing the support services or by the Distributor unless otherwise agreed.

The fee shall be equal to 5.2% of the \"gross proceeds\" received in the Offering attributable to the efforts of the Agent. At least 48 hours prior to each Closing, the Agent shall deliver a schedule, identified as Appendix A, that lists each investor and the amount of investment.\n\nb. Agent shall be reimbursed for expenses as contemplated by Section 8 of this Agreement, regardless of whether the Offering is successfully completed. Any out-of-pocket expenses or commissions payable under this Agreement shall be paid in next day funds on the earlier of the initial Closing Date or a determination by the Company to terminate or abandon the Offering, and on each subsequent Closing Date thereafter.",

The fee shall be equal to 5.2% of the \"gross proceeds\" received in the Offering attributable to the efforts of the Agent. Appendix A, detailing investor information, will be submitted at the discretion of the Agent.\n\nb. Agent shall be reimbursed for expenses as contemplated by Section 8 of this Agreement, but only if the Offering is successfully completed. Out-of-pocket expenses will be paid within 30 days following the final Closing Date.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a 5.2% commission and requires Appendix A to be submitted 48 hours prior to each closing. The modified text makes Appendix A submission discretionary. It also changes reimbursement conditions, originally guaranteed regardless of completion to only if successful, and alters the payment timeline.",

                "explanation": "The original Section 11(a) provides a structure where the Agent indemnifies the Company for Agent's actions but is *not* responsible for the Company's bad faith or negligence, etc. By removing sentences from the original text, the edited text shifts the responsibility so that the Agent *is only* responsible for losses or bad faith on the part of the Company. The change makes the original structure now fully favoring the Agent, creating a contradiction in how indemnification is supposed to work under the contract.",

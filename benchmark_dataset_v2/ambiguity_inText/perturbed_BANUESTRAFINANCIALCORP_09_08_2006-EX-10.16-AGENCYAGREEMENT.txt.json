                "original_text": "The Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder: a. The fee shall be equal to 5.2% of the \"gross proceeds\" received in the Offering attributable to the efforts of the Agent. At least 48 hours prior to each Closing, the Agent shall deliver a schedule, identified as Appendix A, that lists each investor and the amount of investment.",
                "changed_text": "The Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder: a. The fee shall be equal to 5.2% of the \"gross proceeds\" received in the Offering attributable to the efforts of the Agent, except in cases where the Company, at its sole discretion, determines that the Agent's efforts were not the primary factor in securing the investment, in which case the fee shall be 2.6%. At least 48 hours prior to each Closing, the Agent shall deliver a schedule, identified as Appendix A, that lists each investor and the amount of investment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the compensation terms. The original text clearly states the fee is 5.2% of gross proceeds attributable to the Agent's efforts. The modified text adds an exception where the Company can reduce the fee to 2.6% based on a subjective determination. This creates uncertainty about how the Agent's compensation will be calculated and creates incentive for the Company to not pay the full fee amount.",

The Company shall direct the Escrow Agent to make payment for Shares sold hereunder by wire transfer or certified or bank cashier's check drawn to the order of the Company in next day funds.",
                "changed_text": "The Company and the Agent shall transmit all funds received from subscribers to the Escrow Agent within three business days following receipt thereof. The Company shall direct the Escrow Agent to make payment for Shares sold hereunder by wire transfer at the Company's discretion, certified, or bank cashier's check drawn to the order of the Company in next day funds.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that funds be transmitted to the Escrow Agent by noon of the next business day. The modified text extends this to three business days. Further, The original text mandates payment for share sold to be only next day funds, where as the altered texts mentions that the company has the discretion for wire transfers which are not necessarily next day funds. This creates an inconsistency regarding the timeframe and methods for processing funds.",

However, the Company will not be responsible for (i) any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses that result from bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Agent or any of its employees, agents, representatives or affiliates, or on the part of the Agent Indemnitee, (ii) that arise out of actions or conduct by the Agent or any of its employees, agents, representatives or affiliates, or by any Agent Indemnitee, that constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state law or regulation, or (iii) that arise out of actions or conduct by the Agent or any of its employees, agents, representatives or affiliates, or by any Agent Indemnitee, that constitutes a violation of any of Agent's agreements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will reimburse the Agent and the Agent Indemnitees for any legal or other expenses incurred (individually or collectively) by it or them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, regardless of reasonableness. However, the Company will not be responsible for (i) any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses that result from bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Agent or any of its employees, agents, representatives or affiliates, or on the part of the Agent Indemnitee, (ii) that arise out of actions or conduct by the Agent or any of its employees, agents, representatives or affiliates, or by any Agent Indemnitee, that constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state law or regulation, or (iii) that arise out of actions or conduct by the Agent or any of its employees, agents, representatives or affiliates, or by any Agent Indemnitee, that constitutes a violation of any of Agent's agreements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, unless said actions were approved by the Company's general counsel.",
                "explanation": "Originally, the reimbursement was limited to 'reasonable' expenses. Now, the modified text removes the reasonableness requirement, potentially obligating the Company to cover exorbitant costs. However, another addition stipulates that If the actions were approved by the company's general counsel, it doesn't fall under the restrictions. This introduces a contradiction because there could be disagreement between both parties of the actions taken with or without the approval of the general counsel. This creates uncertainty regarding how the Agent's expense will be calculated and creates incentive for the Company to decline all reimbursements.",

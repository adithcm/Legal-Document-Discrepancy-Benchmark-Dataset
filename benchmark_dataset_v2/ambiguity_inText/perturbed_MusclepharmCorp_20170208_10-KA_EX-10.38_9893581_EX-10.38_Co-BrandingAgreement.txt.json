                "original_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Distribution Channels\" means the distribution of the Licensed Products through GNC retail and online chains worldwide during the First Contract Year and, thereafter, through MusclePharm's other worldwide distribution channels, as mutually determined by MusclePharm and the AS Parties.",
                "changed_text": "For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Distribution Channels\" means the distribution of the Licensed Products through GNC retail and online chains worldwide during the First Contract Year and, thereafter, through MusclePharm's distribution channels, as solely determined by MusclePharm. The AS Parties input may be considered but MusclePharm holds ultimate decision making power.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires mutual agreement between MusclePharm and the AS Parties regarding distribution channels after the first contract year. The modified text gives MusclePharm the sole authority to determine distribution channels, potentially conflicting with approval rights outlined elsewhere in the agreement.",

In that connection:\n\n(b) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement with respect to the First Contract Year and at least ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of each Contract Year of the Term, MusclePharm will provide the AS Parties with a detailed marketing plan (the \"Marketing Plan\"). The AS Parties shall be entitled to approve the Marketing Plan, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",

MusclePharm will determine the contents of the Marketing Plan in its own discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the AS Parties have approval over a detailed marketing plan, and the plan should be provided 90 days in advance. The modified text provides only a summary 30 days in advance and eliminates the AS Parties' approval rights, significantly reducing their control and input.",

                "explanation": "This change weakens the quality control provisions. The original text emphasizes maintaining a standard prescribed by the AS Parties, whereas the modified text gives MusclePharm discretion over the 'acceptable quality,' creating a contradiction.",

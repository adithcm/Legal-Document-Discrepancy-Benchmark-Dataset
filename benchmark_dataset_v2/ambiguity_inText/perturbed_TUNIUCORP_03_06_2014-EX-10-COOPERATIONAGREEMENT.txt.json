The total sum of Service Fee shall be equal to the amount of profits gained by Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee at its own discretion, without the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries.",
                "changed_text": "4.1 Party A and Party B unanimously agree that they will allocate the proceeds generated from cooperation in accordance with thefollowing provisions:\n\nParty B shall have the right to charge, on a quarterly basis, the service fee (\"Service Fee\") from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services, or designate another person to charge Service Fee from Party A or its subsidiaries who have accepted Party B's Services. The total sum of Service Fee shall be a mutually agreed upon amount, taking into account market conditions and the value of the services provided. Party B shall have the right to adjust the amount of Service Fee with the prior consent of Party A or its subsidiaries, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the Service Fee. Initially, Party B could unilaterally adjust the fee. The modification requires mutual agreement, contradicting the original, creating ambiguity over fee adjustment rights.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the Term of Cooperation. The original definition stated it ends on Party B's operation term expiration, while the altered definition specifies a fixed five-year term. This conflicting term length creates uncertainty.",

The non-breaching Party generally waives the right to request termination of this Agreement it may have according to any applicable laws as a result of the violation acts committed by the breaching Party, unless the breach constitutes a material and irreparable harm.",

The original text limits remedies to liquidated damages and specific performance and waives the right to termination.

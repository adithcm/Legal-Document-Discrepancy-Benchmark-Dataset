The modified definition explicitly excludes them, creating a contradiction. This impacts marketing efforts, where leads that demonstrate an interest are now not consider customers.",

For twelve (12) months after delivery of any Licensed Product to a Customer, whether Customer receives such Licensed Product from Licensee or a Redistributor, Licensor warrants that each Licensed Product will perform as described in the applicable Documentation.

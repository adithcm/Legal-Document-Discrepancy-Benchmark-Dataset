                "explanation": "The original definition includes those who 'indicated interest' in acquiring a sublicense, while the revised definition explicitly excludes them until a sublicense is acquired. This creates ambiguity as to when someone is considered a 'Customer' and subject to contractual obligations.",

However, maintenance and support of the Sublicense Copies and Documentation used by any Redistributors and Customers will be a shared responsibility between Licensor and Licensee, with the specific responsibilities to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The duties of Licensor include the following: (a) Delivering a Master Copy of each Licensed Product and Documentation, including any Upgrades as they become available, to permit Licensee to (1) make Sublicense Copies and copies of the Documentation to meet the demand of Redistributors and Customers and (2) market and license Sublicense Copies and copies of the Documentation, together with the copies of promotional and other materials which Licensor may produce from time to time in order to assist Licensee in marketing and sublicensing the Licensed Products during the term of this Agreement. (b) Employing a sufficient number of skilled technicians experienced in the computing industry and familiar with the Licensed Products and Documentation to provide adequate technical support and assistance to all Redistributors and Customers, contingent upon Licensee contributing financially to the technician's salaries. (c) Providing competent instruction to Redistributors and Customers regarding the use and installation of the Licensed Products, as long as Licensee provides the training facilities. (d) Providing information, including by means of telephone support, to Redistributors and Customers as to the proper procedures and persons to contact to enable the proper installation and operation of the Licensed Products and providing responsive answers to questions and problems regarding the use and operation of the Licensed Products, but only during standard business hours and excluding weekends and holidays.

(f) Delivering to Licensee sample copies of all Licensor's marketing and licensing materials relating to the Licensed Products in use in the United States of America for copying and distribution in the Territory at Licensee's expense.",
                "explanation": "The original section states that the Licensor is *solely* responsible for maintenance and support. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating maintenance and support is now a *shared responsibility*, and adds caveats to the Licensor's duties (b,c,d,e), creating a conflict regarding the extent of Licensor's obligations.",

For twelve (12) months after delivery of any Licensed Product to a Customer, whether Customer receives such Licensed Product from Licensee or a Redistributor, Licensor warrants that each Licensed Product will perform as described in the applicable Documentation. If Licensee or any Redistributor or Customer discovers any errors or discrepancies in the Licensed Products from the Documentation during the twelve (12) month warranty period, Licensee shall notify Licensor promptly in writing of such error or discrepancy in sufficient detail to enable Licensor to recreate the error or discrepancy.

For twelve (12) months after delivery of any Licensed Product directly to a Customer by the Licensee, Licensor warrants that each Licensed Product will perform as described in the applicable Documentation. However, if a Customer receives the Licensed Product through a Redistributor, the warranty period is limited to six (6) months. If Licensee or any Redistributor or Customer discovers any errors or discrepancies in the Licensed Products from the Documentation during the applicable warranty period, the discovering party shall notify Licensor within three (3) days of discovery, by both written and verbal means, of such error or discrepancy in sufficient detail to enable Licensor to recreate the error or discrepancy. If the error or discrepancy is found by Licensee prior to the expiration of the ten (10) day evaluation period set forth in Section 4.2, such evaluation period shall not be extended.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty period is twelve months regardless of whether the Customer receives the product from the Licensee or a Redistributor. The change introduces a different warranty period (6 months) for products received through Redistributors, creates a stricter notification requirement (3 days, written AND verbal), and removes the extension of the evaluation period, resulting in conflicting warranty terms.",

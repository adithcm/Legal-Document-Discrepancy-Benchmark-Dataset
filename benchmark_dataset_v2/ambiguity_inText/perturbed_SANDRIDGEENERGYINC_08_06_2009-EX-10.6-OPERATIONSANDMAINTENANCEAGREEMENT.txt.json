                "original_text": "Operator shall perform its duties and obligations hereunder and its responsibilities as Operator of the Gathering System, (i) in a good and workmanlike manner, (ii) in conformity with the good practices in the natural gas gathering industry, (iii) in accordance with all valid and applicable Laws, including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, (iv) in accordance with the Subject Gathering Agreements, and (v) in accordance with the Proposed Operating Expense Budget.",
                "changed_text": "Operator shall perform its duties and obligations hereunder and its responsibilities as Operator of the Gathering System, (i) in a commercially reasonable manner, (ii) without any specific requirement to conform to the good practices in the natural gas gathering industry, (iii) in accordance with all valid and applicable Laws, including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, (iv) in accordance with the Subject Gathering Agreements, and (v) without being required to comply with the Proposed Operating Expense Budget.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by replacing 'good and workmanlike manner' with 'commercially reasonable manner,' deleting the need to conform to good practices in the natural gas gathering industry and explicitly removing the obligation to follow the Proposed Operating Expense Budget. This creates an internal contradiction if other parts of the contract mandate adherence to industry standards and budget restrictions.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that any failure to exercise a right is a permanent waiver. This creates an internal contradiction if other parts of the contract explicitly state that rights can be exercised at any subsequent time, regardless of prior non-exercise. This would cause issues during any litigation.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by stating that owner can withhold, condition, or delay giving their consent 'for any reason'. This contradicts what was said previously that stated that owner cannot unreasonably do that. This can change the entire dynamic of the agreement.",

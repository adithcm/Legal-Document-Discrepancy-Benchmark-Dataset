This can cause disputes as to whether a provided version constitutes an upgrade under the contract and what obligations Changepoint has to supply it under software support and maintenance. The new texts makes things more uncertain and gives more discretion to Changepoint regarding what constitutes an 'Upgrade' and whether to provide it, conflicting with other sections requiring 'Upgrades'.",

                "explanation": "The original clause imposes an 'immediate duty' on Changepoint to defend against infringement claims. The modification injects discretion around that immediate duty with wording  'reasonable discretion'. If other parts of this contract impose tight deadlines related to support , this causes contradiction and is open for interpretation. Also the original text demands Corio to provide the control while the modified text includes wording such as 'tenders such control that Changepoint deems is reasonable'. The change from 'all reasonable efforts' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' also changes the standard and creates uncertainty.",

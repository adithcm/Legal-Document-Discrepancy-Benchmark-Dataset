                "original_text": "3.3 Notwithstanding Customer's obligations pursuant to clauses 3.1 and 3.4, the first [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] of each Forecast shall constitute a binding commitment of Customer to purchase the quantities of Products set forth in the relevant Forecast for such [Redacted - Commercially Sensitive] period. The Forecast for the period beyond this two (2) month period shall be non-binding except to the extent otherwise provided in clause 3.4. Only Purchase Orders as accepted by Philips, as set forth in clause 3.4 below, constitute an obligation for Philips to actually produce the so ordered Products and no quantities of Products in the Forecast provided by Customer shall constitute an accepted Purchase Order.",

The Forecast for the period beyond this two (2) month period shall be binding on Customer's forecast, but non-binding on actual purchase volumes except to the extent otherwise provided in clause 3.4. Only Purchase Orders as accepted by Philips, as set forth in clause 3.4 below, constitute an obligation for Philips to actually produce the so ordered Products and no quantities of Products in the Forecast provided by Customer shall constitute an accepted Purchase Order.",
                "explanation": "The original clause clearly states the first two months of the forecast are a 'binding commitment'. The modified version states the first two months are a 'non-binding estimate' while simultaneously stating forecasts are 'binding on Customer's forecast, but non-binding on actual purchase volumes'. This creates a contradiction regarding the enforceability of the forecast, making it unclear whether the customer is obligated to purchase the forecasted quantities.",

                "explanation": "The original section provides clear and strict warranties that the products 'conform' to specifications, are 'new', and 'free from defects'. The modification introduces ambiguity by weakening these guarantees. 'Conform' becomes 'conform to a reasonable extent', 'new' becomes 'similar to new', 'free from defects' allows for 'minor defects', and 'comply in all respects' is watered down to 'comply in most respects' and 'substantially comply'. This creates conflicting interpretations as to the level of quality and adherence to standards Philips is bound to, potentially leading to disputes over product acceptance and warranty claims.",

                "explanation": "The original clause explicitly states that Philips can terminate with 'immediate effect' given certain circumstances. The modified version changes that to Philips terminating with 'reasonable effect', which introduces ambiguity about what constitutes 'reasonable' and how long the termination process will actually take. Simultaneously, the requirements of Philips is now 'substantially filed' and 'in a timely fashion' instead of the definitive requirements, creating a contradiction about the basis of the termination.",

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee, and the Licensee hereby accepts from the Licensor, a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the Licensed Mark in the Territory solely and exclusively as a component of the Licensee's own company name and in connection with the Licensed Services and any business provided in conjunction therewith by such Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, the Licensee shall use the Licensed Mark only to the extent permitted under this Agreement, and except as provided above, neither the Licensee nor any of its affiliates, owners, directors, officers, employees or agents shall otherwise use the Licensed Mark or any derivatives without the prior express written consent of the Licensor in its sole and absolute discretion. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee hereunder shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. Upon written notification by the Licensor to the Licensee of noncompliance with the Licensor's quality standards in any material respect, such Licensee shall take appropriate steps, in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such noncompliance.",

The modified version removes the 'solely and exclusively' constraint, thus broadening the scope of permitted use and creating ambiguity. Similarly, 'shall use... only to the extent permitted' is changed to 'may use... to the extent permitted,' weakening the obligation. The phrase 'in its sole and absolute discretion' is also removed, and the phrase 'in any material respect' is also removed. Also, 'in a commercially reasonable time frame, not to exceed sixty (60) days' is changed to 'take steps', creating an ambiguity of how long it should take.",

                "explanation": "The original text states the contract is 'perpetual', but the changed version adds the condition that it's 'provided that both parties mutually agree to its continuation every five years', contradicting the idea of perpetual duration. The original version includes 'one of its affiliates' ceases as investment advisor, whereas the changed version does not, creating an ambiguity regarding 'its affiliates'. The original version also states 'at any time and in its sole discretion', which is not stated in the changed version. Also, 'prior written' has been removed. These creates uncertainty around whether a termination must be reasonable and how consent can be obtained.",

The original text says Licensor can grant or withhold consent 'in its sole and absolute discretion'. The modified version says the Licensor will not 'unreasonably withhold' which creates a standard subject to interpretation. Similarly, 'shall be void ab initio' is changed to 'may be considered void' creating ambiguity as to whether the transaction is automatically void.",

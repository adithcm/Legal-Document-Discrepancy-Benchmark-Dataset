XC shall have approval rights  over  use of its logo by AJR and  shall  designate  which  XC  trademark identifications are utilized by AJR and how they are used in connection with the logos.",
                "changed_text": "The size and placement of the XC logos shall be determined solely by AJR, ensuring optimal visibility for spectators. XC shall have input into the use of its logo by AJR, however AJR has final say on how they are used in connection with the logos.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding logo control. The original text gives XC approval rights, while the modified version grants AJR final say, creating a potential conflict.",

In  addition,  AJR  shall  assist XC in evaluating various applications of wearable and wireless devices  to  automobile   racing   including potential  applications  for the use of  devices  at the track,  in the pits,  in the  stands and  generally  for crowd control.",
                "changed_text": "AJR is encouraged to promote the name, image, brand, and reputation of XC at its discretion, but the extent and nature of such promotion are not mandated. AJR may, if resources permit, assist XC in evaluating applications of wearable devices to automobile racing.",
                "explanation": "This introduces conflict by changing 'shall use its best efforts' to 'is encouraged', weakening AJR's obligation to promote XC.  The language weakens the obligation for promotional activity and resource allocation for technological innovation making it unclear what level of dedication AJR needs to commit.",

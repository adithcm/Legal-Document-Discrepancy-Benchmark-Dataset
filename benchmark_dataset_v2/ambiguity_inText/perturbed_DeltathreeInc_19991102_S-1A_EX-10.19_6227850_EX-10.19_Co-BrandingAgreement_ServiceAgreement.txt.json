PrimeCall's sales force shall assist in selling the Calling Card and PrimeCall shall handle all aspects of the distribution of the Calling Card, including without limitation, the negotiation of agreements with distributors, inventory control, billing and collections. All such agreements shall be approved in advance by DeltaThree. DeltaThree shall be responsible for all costs in connection with such sales and distribution efforts.",
                "changed_text": "Section 3.04  [Sales and Distribution]. Sales and Distribution. PrimeCall's sales force may assist in selling the Calling Card at their discretion, and PrimeCall will endeavor to handle aspects of the distribution of the Calling Card, including the negotiation of agreements with distributors, inventory control, billing and collections, as reasonably practical. All such agreements shall be subject to review by DeltaThree. DeltaThree shall share in the costs in connection with such sales and distribution efforts, as agreed upon in writing.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates PrimeCall's sales force assistance and handling of all distribution aspects, placing responsibility on DeltaThree for all costs. The modified version introduces ambiguity by stating PrimeCall's sales force 'may assist,' reducing the obligation. Replacing 'shall handle' with 'will endeavor to handle' makes the distribution responsibility less binding. 'Approved in advance' is changed to 'subject to review', weakening DeltaThree's control. Finally, 'DeltaThree shall be responsible for all costs' is changed to 'DeltaThree shall share in the costs, as agreed upon in writing,' creating uncertainty about cost allocation and shifting responsibility to a separate agreement. This introduces contradictions because other sections may rely on the initial, stricter interpretation.",

Within three (3) months of the date hereof, DeltaThree shall establish and administrate a PrimeCall web site (the \"PrimeCall Web Site\") in consultation with PrimeCall which will enable PrimeCall to market and sell its calling cards via the World Wide Web and provide on-line support for such sales. The PrimeCall Web Site shall be a fully functional e-commerce site, with all ordering and billing performed on-line. DeltaThree shall provide ongoing upgrades to the PrimeCall Web Site, shall develop a database for the PrimeCall Web Site, and shall oversee all billing, collections and fulfillment for on-line orders. PrimeCall shall establish its own merchant account with Citibank or another accredited United States banking institution and provide DeltaThree with all information pertaining to such account to enable DeltaThree to process all on-line credit card transactions for PrimeCall. PrimeCall shall be fully liable for all charge-backs, refunds and commission payments associated with the processing of PrimeCall's on-line credit card transactions by DeltaThree. DeltaThree shall establish for PrimeCall an on-line interactive center whereby PrimeCall shall be able to monitor the on-line sales of its calling cards. All calling card and pricing information shall be provided by PrimeCall. DeltaThree shall be responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with the operation and maintenance of the PrimeCall Web Site and the services provided pursuant to this Section 4.01  [Web Site Development and Services] shall be provided at no additional cost to PrimeCall; provided, however, that PrimeCall shall be fully responsible for all costs associated with the purchase of hardware, software and domain names related to the PrimeCall website. PrimeCall agrees to cooperate and provide necessary support to assist DeltaThree in providing the services under this Section 4.01  [Web Site Development and Services] and shall be responsible for supplying DeltaThree with the content and graphics (look and feel) of the PrimeCall website. In addition, upon the execution of this Agreement, each party shall appoint an account manager to work directly on the implementation of this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Section 4.01  [Web Site Development and Services]. Web Site Development and Services. DeltaThree will use commercially reasonable efforts to establish and administrate a PrimeCall web site (the \"PrimeCall Web Site\") in consultation with PrimeCall which will enable PrimeCall to market and sell its calling cards via the World Wide Web and provide on-line support for such sales. The PrimeCall Web Site should be a functional e-commerce site, with ordering and billing ideally performed on-line. DeltaThree will consider providing ongoing upgrades to the PrimeCall Web Site, may develop a database for the PrimeCall Web Site, and will attempt to oversee billing, collections and fulfillment for on-line orders. PrimeCall shall use its best efforts to establish its own merchant account with Citibank or another accredited United States banking institution and make available to DeltaThree information pertaining to such account to enable DeltaThree to process online credit card transactions for PrimeCall. PrimeCall will endeavor to be liable for charge-backs, refunds and commission payments associated with the processing of PrimeCall's on-line credit card transactions by DeltaThree. DeltaThree will explore establishing for PrimeCall an on-line interactive center whereby PrimeCall shall be able to monitor the on-line sales of its calling cards. All calling card and pricing information will be given to DeltaThree by PrimeCall. DeltaThree and PrimeCall will equally share the costs and expenses in connection with the operation and maintenance of the PrimeCall Web Site and the services provided pursuant to this Section 4.01  [Web Site Development and Services]. PrimeCall agrees to collaborate to provide necessary support to aid DeltaThree in furnishing the services under this Section 4.01  [Web Site Development and Services] and will consider being responsible for supplying DeltaThree with the content and graphics (look and feel) of the PrimeCall website. In addition, upon the execution of this Agreement, each party might appoint an account manager to work directly on the implementation of this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Multiple contradictions are introduced. 'Shall establish' becomes 'will use commercially reasonable efforts', 'shall provide' becomes 'will consider providing', 'shall oversee' becomes 'will attempt to oversee', 'shall be fully liable' becomes 'will endeavor to be liable', and 'shall be responsible for all costs' becomes 'DeltaThree and PrimeCall will equally share the costs'. These changes significantly weaken DeltaThree's obligations and introduce uncertainty regarding cost allocation and responsibilities. Also, the word 'shall' from the phrase 'will be given to DeltaThree by PrimeCall' and 'will collaborate to provide' is altered to 'will be given to DeltaThree by PrimeCall' and 'will collaborate to provide' respectively. Finally, 'might appoint an account manager' is added to introduce the ambiguity to account manager role in this agreement. This creates an in-text contradiction because other parts of the agreement may rely on the initial firm commitments. This creates an internal contradiction and enforceability issues.",

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by DeltaThree without the prior written consent of PrimeCall. PrimeCall may assign this Agreement to any affiliate of PrimeCall or in connection with a merger or consolidation of PrimeCall or a sale of all or substantially all of PrimeCall's business.

This Agreement is generally intended to be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by DeltaThree without making a reasonable effort to obtain the prior written consent of PrimeCall. PrimeCall can typically assign this Agreement to any affiliate of PrimeCall or in connection with a merger or consolidation of PrimeCall or a sale of all or substantially all of PrimeCall's business, unless otherwise agreed. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement may not usually be assigned by PrimeCall without attempting to obtain the prior written consent of DeltaThree.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits assignment by DeltaThree and PrimeCall without consent, except under specific circumstances for PrimeCall. The modified text introduces ambiguity. 'Shall be binding' becomes 'is generally intended to be binding,' weakening the obligation. 'May not be assigned' becomes 'may not be assigned without making a reasonable effort to obtain the prior written consent,' making the consent requirement less stringent. 'PrimeCall may assign' becomes 'PrimeCall can typically assignâ€¦unless otherwise agreed,' adding an exception and making the assignment right conditional and subject to another agreement, if exists. 'May not be assigned' becomes 'may not usually be assigned without attempting to obtain the prior written consent', introducing a weaker requirement and implies a potential for assignment without consent. These changes introduce contradictions because other clauses may rely on the original, strict limitations on assignment. The word 'shall' from the phrase 'shall be binding' is altered to 'is generally intended to be binding'. This introduces ambiguity and enforceability issues.",

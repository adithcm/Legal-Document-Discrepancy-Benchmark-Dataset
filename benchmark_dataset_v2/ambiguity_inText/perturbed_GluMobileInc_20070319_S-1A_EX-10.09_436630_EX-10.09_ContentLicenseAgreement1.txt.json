For sake of clarity, wireless products are uniquely defined within each exhibits, and supersede any other definition in the contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text defines 'Wireless Products' by referring to Exhibits B through M and Exhibit N (Glossary). The modified text now states that Wireless Products are defined solely in Exhibits B through M, overriding any definition in the Glossary, and implying that definitions are unique in each exhibit. This creates contradiction with Exhibit N, where some wireless products are defined, creating ambiguity regarding the true definition.",

Licensee shall (A) participate in face to face meetings and conference calls regarding marketing from time to time, the frequency, location and subject matter of which shall be determined solely by Licensee; (B) submit a marketing plan for the Wireless Products generally, which is optional and at the discretion of Licensee; (C) commit funds to the marketing of the Wireless Products at a level determined by Licensee based on its own internal budget allocations; (D) perform business to business and trade marketing efforts (e.g., to the CSPs) as Licensee deems appropriate; and (E) designate a point of contact, which may be reassigned or eliminated at Licensee's discretion.",
                "explanation": "The original text outlines specific requirements for Licensee's marketing efforts, implying obligations to Fox. The modified text gives Licensee complete discretion over the marketing efforts. This creates a conflict with the original intent by making those efforts optional and internally driven rather than collaboratively defined, creating ambiguity in obligations. If Fox expected certain marketing efforts, this contradiction prevents enforceability.",

Licensee agrees that no additional Wireless Products may be developed or distributed during the Sell Off Period and Licensee agrees to require that any Licensed CSP to comply with this provision.

                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits development or distribution of new products and mandates destruction of remaining inventory. The modified text now permits further development and distribution and makes inventory disposal negotiable. This contradicts the original's strict sell-off period rules, creating uncertainty about permissible activities post-termination and leading to conflicting interpretations during potential disputes.",

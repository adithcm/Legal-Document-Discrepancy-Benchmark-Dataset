                "explanation": "Clause 11.1 now states holiday will be taken at times convenient to the Executive, which conflicts with the Company's ability to require outstanding holiday to be taken under clause 11.3. Clause 11.2 now states that all accrued holiday may be carried over. This introduces a contradiction with the original statement that no accrued holiday can be carried over. This uncertainty could lead to legal disputes over unused holiday.",

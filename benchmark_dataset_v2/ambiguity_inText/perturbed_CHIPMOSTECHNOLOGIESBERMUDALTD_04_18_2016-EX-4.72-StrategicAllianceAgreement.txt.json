The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.",

The Parties may negotiate for an extension of this Agreement six (6) months before the expiration of the Cooperation Period.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least 90 days before the end of the initial term or any renewal term.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the term of the agreement. Section 2.1 initially states a fixed three-year term with an option to negotiate an extension. The added sentence introduces an automatic renewal clause unless notice is given, creating uncertainty whether active negotiation is required for extension or if it happens automatically.",

If the Parties fail to resolve such dispute amicably through negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date on which a Party issues its Dispute Notice to the other Party, each Party shall have the right to submit such dispute to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, and proceed with the arbitration procedures in accordance with the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce with three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall each select one (1) arbitrator, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. All language used in such proceedings shall be Mandarin Chinese. The Parties agree to keep the content of the dispute and the proceeding of the arbitration confidential. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. The losing Party in such arbitration shall bear all of the costs and expenses related to the arbitration as determined by the arbitrators in such dispute (including attorney's fees).",

                "explanation": "This introduces a conflicting jurisdiction clause. The initial part of Section 3.1 specifies that all disputes are to be resolved through arbitration in Hong Kong. The added clause carves out an exception, stating that intellectual property disputes must be resolved in Beijing courts. This creates uncertainty and conflict regarding the appropriate forum for resolving disputes involving intellectual property, as it is unclear if Hong Kong arbitration still applies.",

Such amendment shall become effective unless the other party objects in writing within the thirty (30) day period, in which case the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the amendment.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that any amendment to the agreement requires written consent from both parties. The added clause allows unilateral amendment of Schedule A (which defines specifications) with a 30-day notice period. This contradicts the 'entire agreement' clause, as it enables one party to alter a part of the agreement without explicit consent, leading to uncertainty about the process for amending the agreement as a whole versus specific sections.",

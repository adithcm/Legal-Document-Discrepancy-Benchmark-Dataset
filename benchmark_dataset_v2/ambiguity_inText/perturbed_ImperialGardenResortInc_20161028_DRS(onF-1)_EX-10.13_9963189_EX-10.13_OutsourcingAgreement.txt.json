The fees for planning and design of the buildings and construction monitoring shall be calculated based on a ratio to be determined later, not exceeding 2.50% of the legal construction cost hereof. Should Party A require a comprehensive modification on the development plan of the project outsourced and any subsequent extra cost occur in Party B; Party A shall bear the corresponding extra service fee, capped at NTD 500,000.",
                "explanation": "The first sentence states the service fee for specific parts. The second sentence initially defines the fee calculation for planning and design as 3.50% of the legal construction cost, creating a clear financial obligation. The modified text introduces ambiguity by stating the calculation will be \"determined later\" and capping it at 2.50%, creating uncertainty about the total fee and contradicting the initial specification of 3.50%. The cap on extra costs also introduces contradiction.",

Term Planned\n\nParty B shall make the most economical and effective arrangement for Party A with respect to the project based on the principle of alignment with the plan progress of Party A. The term planned is stated as following: I. Topographic survey and measurement, geological drilling and program evaluation (about 1.0 months); II. Establishment of architectural development plan and business plan (about 2.0 months); III. Development of soil and water conservation plan (about 2.0 months); IV.

Term Planned\n\nParty B shall make the most economical and effective arrangement for Party A with respect to the project based on the principle of alignment with the plan progress of Party A. The term planned is stated as following: I. Topographic survey and measurement, geological drilling and program evaluation (approximately 1.0 months); II.

                "explanation": "Initially, the term planned provides timelines for specific stages. The modified text introduces a contradiction by changing the timeline for architectural development plan to 4 months from 2 months, environmental impact assessment report to 4 months from 8 months, and by changing \"about\" to \"approximately\" for Topographic survey and measurement and by adding \"at least\" for soil and water conservation plan. This creates potential dispute regarding project delays as timeframes are not clearly defined. There is an in-text contradiction as the original timeline is now altered.",

                "explanation": "Initially, Party B had strict duties. The modified text introduces ambiguity. Changing \"shall follow all instructions\" to \"shall follow most instructions\" and adding \"endeavor to ensure\" creates uncertainty about the extent of Party B's compliance. The addition of “attempt to maintain benefits and interests of Party A most of the time” weakens party B's obligation to protect party A's interests. Changing \"is obligatory to report\" to \"should report\" makes reporting optional. This weakens the contractual obligation and responsibility of party B.",

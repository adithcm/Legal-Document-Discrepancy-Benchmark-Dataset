                "changed_text": "(a) \"Titles\" shall mean the programming initially listed on Schedule A. The definition shall not be updated to include any future amendments to Schedule A.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Titles' allows for updates to Schedule A to dynamically change the definition, whereas the modified definition freezes the definition to the initial content of Schedule A. This contradiction creates confusion about which programming is covered under the agreement if Schedule A is later amended.",

                "original_text": "(b) Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee's business with prior written notice to Licensor and subject to the applicable limitations (if any) in Section 2(a)(i) [License Grant]. Except as otherwise specified in the previous sentence, Licensee may not sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) [License Grant] without Licensor's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.",
                "changed_text": "(b) Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee's business without any notice or consent from the Licensor. Licensee may sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) [License Grant] with Licensor's prior written consent, which shall be given or denied at Licensor's sole and absolute discretion.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding sublicensing. The original text allows for sublicensing with prior written notice but requires Licensor's consent only under specific circumstances. The modified version removes the 'prior written notice' requirement and stipulates that Licensor's consent for general sublicensing can be withheld at its sole discretion, creating conflicting terms for sublicensing conditions. This can create confusion about if sublicensing can occur in the ordinary course of business without any consent.",

                "original_text": "Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor shall be solely responsible for any and all royalties and other fees payable to any applicable licensor(s) or any third party for distribution of the Titles by Licensee (including, without limitation, residuals and clearances or other payments to guilds or unions and rights for music clearances, such as performance rights, synchronization rights and mechanical rights), and all other fees, payments and obligations arising out of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, and Licensee shall have no responsibility or liability for any such royalties or fees.",
                "changed_text": "Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor and Licensee shall be jointly responsible for any and all royalties and other fees payable to any applicable licensor(s) or any third party for distribution of the Titles by Licensee (including, without limitation, residuals and clearances or other payments to guilds or unions and rights for music clearances, such as performance rights, synchronization rights and mechanical rights), and all other fees, payments and obligations arising out of the activities contemplated by this Agreement, with each party responsible for 50% of all such amounts. Licensee shall retain the right to negotiate royalty rates on behalf of both parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause places the sole responsibility for royalties and fees on the Licensor. The revised clause introduces a joint responsibility, splitting the costs 50/50 between Licensor and Licensee. This direct contradiction creates ambiguity about who is ultimately liable for these payments and opens the door to potential disputes. This could also create confusion with the statement 'Licensee shall retain the right to negotiate royalty rates on behalf of both parties.' Who gets the final say on those rates?",

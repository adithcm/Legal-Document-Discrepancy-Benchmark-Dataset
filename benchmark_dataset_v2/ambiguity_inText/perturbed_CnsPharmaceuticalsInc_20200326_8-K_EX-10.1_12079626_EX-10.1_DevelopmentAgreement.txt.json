                "explanation": "The addition of 'unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties on a quarterly basis. The Development Fee will then be 25% of Net Sales' introduces ambiguity. While the initial definition establishes a clear 50% rate, the added clause allows for fluctuating rates, conflicting with the initial fixed percentage. This inconsistency creates uncertainty in calculating payments.",

Particular Confidential Information shall not be deemed to come under any of the above exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is or becomes subject to any of the above exceptions.",

                "explanation": "The clause 'and for a period of five (5) years thereafter' is removed from the first sentence and the addition of 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality obligations extend for only one (1) year following the termination of this agreement.' introduces a contradiction regarding the duration of confidentiality. Initially, it's five years after termination, but the added sentence reduces it to one year. This discrepancy creates confusion about the enforceable confidentiality period after the contract ends.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'Notwithstanding the foregoing, CNS may terminate this agreement immediately if WPD fails to meet a deadline, as determined in sole discretion of CNS.' introduces a contradiction. The initial termination clause (i) requires a 30-day notice for material breaches, allowing the breaching party to cure the issue. The added sentence allows CNS to terminate immediately for any missed deadline, regardless of materiality or cure, conflicting with the original provision. This disparity raises uncertainty about the termination process.",

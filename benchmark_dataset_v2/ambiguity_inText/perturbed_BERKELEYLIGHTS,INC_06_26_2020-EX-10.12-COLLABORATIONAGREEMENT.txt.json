                "original_text": "1.86 \"Intellectual Property\" means all intellectual and industrial property, and all rights therein and thereto, including registration rights thereto, of any kind throughout the world, including Patent Rights, Software, ideas, data, inventions, discoveries, algorithms, formulas, compositions, configurations, specifications, sequences, product applications, formulations, assays, techniques, sketches, drawings, models, works of authorship, copyrights, recordings, moral rights, mask works, design rights, trademarks, trade names, trade dress, service marks, logos, trade secrets, methods, processes, techniques, developments, know-how, and all other similar rights, whether or not registered or capable of being registered in any jurisdiction.",
                "changed_text": "1.86 \"Intellectual Property\" means only issued patents and registered trademarks. It does not include any other kind of intellectual property or rights, including but not limited to pending patent applications, unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, or any other similar rights, whether or not registered or capable of being registered in any jurisdiction. Intellectual property is limited to only those items that have been formally registered with a governmental entity.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Intellectual Property.' The original definition is broad, encompassing various forms of intellectual property, both registered and unregistered. The modified definition severely restricts the term to only issued patents and registered trademarks, excluding other forms of IP, creating uncertainty regarding the scope and protection of different types of IP under the contract.",

                "changed_text": "1.35 \"Conforming Product\" means, with respect to a Beacon Optofluidic Machine or Consumable delivered by BLI to Ginkgo under this Agreement, that such Beacon Optofluidic Machine or Consumable is delivered in the specified packaging. The functionality or meeting of the Product Warranty is explicitly excluded from this definition.",
                "explanation": "This creates a contradiction in what constitutes a 'Conforming Product.' The original text states that the product must meet the Product Warranty. The changed text states that it only needs to be delivered in specified packaging, excluding functionality and the Product Warranty. This makes it unclear what the criteria are for a product to be considered 'conforming,' potentially leading to disputes over acceptance and payment.",

The Parties will undertake this Agreement in furtherance of the Purpose and under the guidance of the JRC pursuant to Article 3 (Joint Review Committee). During the Term, each Party will use diligent efforts to implement and perform (itself or through its Permitted Subcontractors) its respective obligations under and in accordance with (a) this Agreement and (b) each Workflow Development Plan in accordance with the timelines set forth in such Workflow Development Plan. Each Party will reasonably cooperate with each other in the performance of their responsibilities under this Agreement and each Workflow Development Plan, including (i) responding to reasonable requests by the other Party submitted in accordance with this Agreement to provide information reasonably necessary for the performance of such requesting Party's obligations under this Agreement (including any Workflow Development Plan) and (ii) causing its personnel, agents and representatives, while at the other Party's facility, to abide by the written work rules and facility regulations applicable to such facility as provided in advance by such other Party.",

The Parties will undertake this Agreement in furtherance of the Purpose and without any requirement for using efforts of any kind to implement and perform the obligations. Each Party will not be required to cooperate with each other in the performance of their responsibilities under this Agreement and each Workflow Development Plan. No Party is required to respond to any requests by the other Party to provide information reasonably necessary for the performance of such requesting Party's obligations under this Agreement (including any Workflow Development Plan) and no Party is required to abide by the written work rules and facility regulations applicable to such facility as provided in advance by such other Party.",
                "explanation": "This completely undermines the spirit and intent of collaboration by removing any obligation to use efforts, cooperate, or even follow basic rules. This sharply contradicts the original text which emphasizes 'diligent efforts' and 'reasonable cooperation.' This conflicting section would allow a party to completely disregard any collaborative obligations, undermining the core Purpose of the agreement.",

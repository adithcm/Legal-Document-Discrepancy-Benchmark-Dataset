                "explanation": "The original definition of 'Affiliate' is broad, encompassing various levels of control. The added definition in Clause 8.5 restricts the meaning of 'Affiliate' specifically for notice delivery purposes, creating a contradiction. This ambiguity could lead to disputes about whether a notice was correctly served if a subsidiary with indirect control is involved.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that NO decision of the Steering Committee is binding without approval from both governing bodies. The changed text introduces an exception where decisions regarding 'operational efficiencies' ARE immediately binding. This creates an internal contradiction, making it unclear which decisions require further ratification and which do not, and the contract fails to define what an 'operational efficiency' means.",

                "changed_text": "4.1 For two (2) years following the Effective Time, QIWI covenants that at least one half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system during such two-year period shall be settled through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie. Notwithstanding the foregoing, QIWI shall use its best efforts to settle all transactions possible through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie. QIWI may terminate its obligation under this Clause 4.1 at any time, in which case it shall pay to Otkritie a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie for such period starting from 1 September 2014, until the date of termination of QIWI's obligations under this Clause 4.1 in connection with (i) the transfer of settlement bank function to PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie ; and (ii) supporting the settlement bank functionality for the Contact money transfer system, provided further that such fee shall in no event exceed RUB 50 000 000 (fifty million roubles).",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies a minimum of one half of the transactions. The modified version adds the phrase 'QIWI shall use its best efforts to settle all transactions possible through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie.' This creates a contradiction because 'one half' establishes a definite minimum, while 'best efforts to settle all' implies an obligation to strive for 100%, potentially conflicting with the flexibility afforded by the 'one half' provision. It is unclear if QIWI only needs to settle at least 50% of the transactions or use its best efforts to settle 100% of the transactions.",

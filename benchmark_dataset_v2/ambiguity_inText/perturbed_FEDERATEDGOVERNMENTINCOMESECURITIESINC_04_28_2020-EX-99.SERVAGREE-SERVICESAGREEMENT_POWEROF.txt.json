                "original_text": "Any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact hereunder for the Adviser on behalf of any Fund is hereby expressly put on notice that FASC is acting solely in the capacity as an agent of the Adviser as agent for the Fund and that any such person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity must look solely to the Fund in question for enforcement of any claim against the Fund, as FASC assumes no personal liability whatsoever for obligations of the Fund entered into by FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the Adviser.",
                "changed_text": "Any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity dealing with FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact hereunder for the Adviser on behalf of any Fund is hereby expressly put on notice that FASC is acting solely in the capacity as an agent of the Adviser as agent for the Fund. FASC assumes full liability for obligations of the Fund entered into by FASC in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding FASC's liability. The original text states FASC assumes no personal liability, while the modified text states it assumes full liability. This creates ambiguity as to whether FASC is liable for the Fund's obligations.",

Such revocation or termination is effective immediately upon the Adviser deciding to revoke or terminate, regardless of whether FASC has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in writing from the Adviser.",
                "explanation": "This change creates conflicting terms about when the Limited Power of Attorney is revoked. The original text states that the termination isn't effective until FASC receives actual notice in writing. The modified text says termination is effective immediately upon the Adviser's decision regardless of whether FASC has been notified. This creates an ambiguity.",

The original text states it may be changed only by a writing signed by both parties, except for the list of Funds. The modified text states the agreement may be changed at any time by either party without notice, including by changing the list of funds.

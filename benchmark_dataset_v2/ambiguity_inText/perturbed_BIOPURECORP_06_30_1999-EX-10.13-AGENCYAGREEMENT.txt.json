The Territory is defined as that geographical area in which said Agent is represented by a full time field sales representative, and of which assigned Distributor agrees to be responsible for mutually agreed upon quarterly and annual sales objectives as described in the \"Business Plan\". Compensation by the Company to the Agent will be limited to the area stated as follows:\n\nThe 48 Continental United States (including DC) plus Alaska    3",

Compensation by the Company to the Agent will be for all sales originating from within the United States.\n\nThe 48 Continental United States (including DC) plus Alaska    3",
                "explanation": "The original definition restricts the territory based on the agent's physical sales representation and mutually agreed-upon objectives. The modified definition broadens the territory to the entire United States, creating a contradiction regarding the scope of sales for which the agent will be compensated. This leads to ambiguity on whether the agent's compensation is based on sales performance or any sales across the country.",

The Company is expected to always be able to immediately ship orders no matter what. Orders received on Fridays or the day before holidays will be shipped that day at no expense.

                "explanation": "This perturbation alters the Company's obligation to fulfill orders. The original text states the Company will use \"reasonable best efforts\" to ship orders within a day. The modification states that the company will \"guarantee\" the delivery no matter the circumstances, but doesn't actually guarantee any actual compensation for these actions. This creates a contradiction if the \"Business Plan\" dictates a more lenient approach and/or the original text provides a more specific guideline for compensation. There may be ambiguity regarding inventory, logistics, and how those are impacted by the two conflicting goals.",

                "explanation": "This perturbation introduces several contradictions regarding warranties. The original text warrants a 12-month shelf life, compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, replacement as the exclusive remedy and denies any reliance on statements outside the written agreement. The modified text reduces the shelf-life warranty to 6 months, warrants compliance with \"industry practices\" instead of laws, offers a refund instead of a replacement, limits damages to $500 and states that representations made can and do constitute warranties and can be relied upon. There is also a removal of the disclaimer about the company not providing any other warranties of any sort. These conflicting terms create a situation where it's impossible to determine the actual extent or remedy available under the product warranty.",

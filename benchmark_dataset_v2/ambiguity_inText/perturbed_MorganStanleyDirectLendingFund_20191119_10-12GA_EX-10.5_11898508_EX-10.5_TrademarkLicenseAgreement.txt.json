                "explanation": "The original text allows for immediate termination for any reason. The modified version introduces a 30-day notice period and an opportunity to rectify issues, creating a contradiction regarding the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated for convenience. This makes the termination process less clear-cut, potentially leading to disputes.",

Licensee may not assign, transfer, pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber this Agreement or its right to use the Brand (or assume this Agreement in bankruptcy), in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Licensor in its sole discretion, except for an assignment outside of bankruptcy to a successor organization that is solely the result of a name change by Licensee. For the avoidance of doubt, a merger, change of control, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the stock of Licensee shall be deemed an \"assignment\" requiring the above consent, regardless of whether Licensee is the surviving entity or whether such transaction constitutes an assignment under applicable law. Licensee acknowledges that its identity is a material condition that induced Licensor to enter into this Agreement. Any attempted action in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect, and shall result in immediate termination of this Agreement. In the event of a permitted assignment hereunder, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted assigns.",
                "changed_text": "Section 8. Assignments. Licensee may assign, transfer, pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber this Agreement or its right to use the Brand (or assume this Agreement in bankruptcy), in whole or in part, with notification to Licensor, but not requiring Licensor's consent, except in cases of bankruptcy. For the avoidance of doubt, a merger, change of control, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the stock of Licensee shall only be deemed an \"assignment\" if it materially alters the nature of the Licensee Business. Licensee acknowledges that its identity is a material condition that induced Licensor to enter into this Agreement. Any attempted action in violation of the foregoing shall be subject to Licensorâ€™s review. In the event of a permitted assignment hereunder, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted assigns.",
                "explanation": "The original text strictly prohibits assignment without Licensor's consent, with explicit inclusion of events like mergers. The modified text allows assignment with mere notification in most cases, except bankruptcy, and narrows the definition of 'assignment'. This creates a contradiction in how assignments are handled, leading to potential disputes over the circumstances requiring Licensor's consent and what constitutes a prohibited assignment.",

While encouraged, Licensee is not required to submit all proposed uses of the Brand to Licensor for prior written approval, except in cases involving major advertising campaigns. Routine uses of the Brand do not require such approval, but should adhere to quality control guidelines.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates prior written approval for *all* uses of the Brand. The modified text introduces an exception for 'routine uses' and major advertising campaigns, creating a contradiction about the scope of required approval. It becomes unclear what constitutes a 'routine use' versus a use requiring approval, introducing ambiguity and potential for dispute over compliance.",

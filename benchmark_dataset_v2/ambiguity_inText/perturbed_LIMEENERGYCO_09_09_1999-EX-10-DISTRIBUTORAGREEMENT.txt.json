The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10) years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.  If Distributor complies with all of the terms of this Agreement, the Agreement  shall be  renewable on an annual basis for one (1) year terms for up to  another  ten (10) years on the same terms and conditions as set forth herein.

The modified text adds 'at the Company's sole discretion', creating a contradiction. Now, it's unclear if compliance guarantees renewal or if the Company has the final say regardless of compliance.",

                "explanation": "The clause determining the repurchase price is modified to state that the price will be determined solely by the Company. This directly contradicts the original clause that specifies the 'net invoice price paid by the Distributor'. This creates uncertainty and unfairness, as the Company could potentially offer an unreasonably low price, undermining the Distributor's rights upon termination.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the properties Robots and Kingdom of Heaven, the term will automatically extend until December 31, 2008, regardless of any other provision in this section.",

The modified version adds a contradictory statement specifying a different expiration date (December 31, 2008) for two specific properties (Robots and Kingdom of Heaven), creating ambiguity about the actual term length for those properties.",

The conflicting addition states that financial notices should still be sent to his old email, creating confusion about who the official point of contact is and whether notices sent to the General Counsel regarding financial matters are sufficient.",

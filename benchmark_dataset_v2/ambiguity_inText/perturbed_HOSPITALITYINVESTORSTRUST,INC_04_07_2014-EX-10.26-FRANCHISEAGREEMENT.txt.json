You acknowledge and agree that the premature termination of this Agreement will cause substantial damage to us. You agree that Liquidated Damages are not a penalty, but represent a reasonable estimate of the minimum just and fair compensation for the damages we will suffer as the result of your failure to operate the Hotel for the Term. If this Agreement terminates before the Expiration Date, you will pay us Liquidated Damages as follows:\n   14.4.1.1 If termination occurs before you begin the Hotel Work and before the Opening Date, and you or any Guarantor (or your or any Guarantor's Affiliates) directly or indirectly, enter into a franchise, license, management, lease and/or other similar agreement for or begin construction or commence operation of a hotel, motel, inn, or similar facility at the Hotel Site under a Competitor Brand within one (1) year after termination, then you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $3,600 multiplied by the number of approved Guest Rooms at the Hotel.",

You acknowledge and agree that the premature termination of this Agreement may or may not cause damage to us. You agree that in some cases Liquidated Damages might be considered a penalty, and might not always represent a fair compensation for the damages we will suffer as the result of your failure to operate the Hotel for the Term. If this Agreement terminates before the Expiration Date, you might be asked to pay us Liquidated Damages as follows:\n   14.4.1.1 If termination occurs before you begin the Hotel Work and before the Opening Date, and you or any Guarantor (or your or any Guarantor's Affiliates) directly or indirectly, enter into a franchise, license, management, lease and/or other similar agreement for or begin construction or commence operation of a hotel, motel, inn, or similar facility at the Hotel Site under a Competitor Brand within one (1) year after termination, then you will not pay us Liquidated Damages at all, and the franchisor will pay you 100,000 USD.",
                "explanation": "The original text clearly states that liquidated damages are a reasonable estimate and not a penalty and they WILL be paid. The changed text introduces uncertainty by stating that damages MAY or MAY NOT occur, they MIGHT be considered a penalty, and might not always be representative of actual damages. Also the changed version mentions in 14.4.1.1 that instead of you paying us, we will pay you a certain amount. This adds contradiction.",

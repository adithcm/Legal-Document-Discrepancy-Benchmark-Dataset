                "original_text": "1.26 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means: (a) with respect to the efforts to be expended, or considerations to be undertaken, by a Party or its Affiliate with respect to any objective, activity or decision to be undertaken hereunder, reasonable, good faith efforts to accomplish such objective, activity or decision as such Party would normally use to accomplish a similar objective, activity or decision under similar circumstances; and (b) with respect to Development and Commercialization of any Licensed Product for any indication by a Party, efforts and resources consistent with those efforts and resources commonly used by a similarly situated biotechnology company with respect to a product owned by it or to which it has similar rights, which product is at a similar stage in its development or product life and is of similar market potential taking into account (i) the patent and other proprietary position of the Licensed Product and (ii) the anticipated profitability of the Licensed Product.",
                "changed_text": "1.26 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" means: (a) with respect to the efforts to be expended, or considerations to be undertaken, by a Party or its Affiliate with respect to any objective, activity or decision to be undertaken hereunder, minimal efforts to accomplish such objective, activity or decision as such Party sees fit; and (b) with respect to Development and Commercialization of any Licensed Product for any indication by a Party, efforts and resources that the Party deems appropriate, regardless of the stage in development, product life or market potential taking into account (i) the patent and other proprietary position of the Licensed Product and (ii) the anticipated profitability of the Licensed Product.",
                "explanation": "The original definition of \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" sets a standard based on good faith efforts and comparison to similar companies. The modified definition allows for subjective, minimal effort, creating a contradiction when other sections require \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" for specific tasks. This affects contract enforcement since one party could argue they met the minimal standard while the other expected a more substantial effort.",

Vyera shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in connection with such Commercialization of Licensed Products in the Territory for each indication in the Field for which such Licensed Products have received Regulatory Approval, and shall conduct Commercialization activities in material compliance with Applicable Laws and shall ensure that its Third Party contractors conduct Commercialization activities in material compliance with Applicable Laws.",

                "explanation": "The change assigns costs and expenses to CytoDyn for Commercialization that the original text says Vyera shall pay. This creates an internal contradiction if another part of the contract enforces that Vyera Commercializes the product. In that case itâ€™s unclear who is responsible for the financial requirements of Commercialization.",

FOR CLARITY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS SECTION 13.5, ROYALTIES AND MILESTONES PAYABLE TO CYTODYN IN CONNECTION WITH VYERA'S COMMERCIALIZATION OF LICENSED PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT COULD CONSTITUTE DIRECT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT AWARDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 12.",

                "explanation": "The last sentence in 13.5 originally implies royalties and milestones could be considered direct damages, despite the preceding text limiting liability for indirect damages. I'm removing the last sentence to specifically designate royalties and milestones as consequential (indirect) damages, despite them being based on actual sales. This impacts liability for breach of contract, creating disputes over the scope of damages recoverable.",

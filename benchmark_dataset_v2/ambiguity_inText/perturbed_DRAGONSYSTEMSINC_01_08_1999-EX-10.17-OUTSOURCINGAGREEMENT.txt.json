                "original_text": "Payments will be due in US dollars within 30 days after delivery, or when agreed after delivery of installments or the receipt of invoice by Dragon Systems, which ever is later. MMI shall invoice Dragon Systems indicating the performed services in US$ with reference to this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Payments will be due in US dollars within 60 days after delivery. MMI shall invoice Dragon Systems indicating the performed services in US$ with reference to this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement stated payments were due within 30 days after delivery, or when agreed after delivery of installments or the receipt of invoice, whichever is later. The modification removes the 'whichever is later' clause and extends the payment due date to a fixed 60 days after delivery, creating conflict and ambiguity. In other sections, the 'receipt of invoice' clause may be interpreted as the trigger date for payment, now contradicted by this fixed 60-day period.",

Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed or should the Services become defective within 6 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims.",
                "changed_text": "MMI warrants providing the Services with due diligence and care in accordance\n\n\n\nwith the specifications set by Dragon Systems. Should MMI not supply the Services as agreed, Dragon Systems may at its option require MMI to complete or re-perform the Services within a reasonable period of time, rescind the contract or refuse payment of the compensation in part or in total, notwithstanding any damage claims. Services are considered defective only after 12 months from their delivery to Dragon Systems.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that services are considered defective within 6 months of delivery. The modified text changes this to 12 months, creating conflicting definitions of what constitutes a 'defective service.' This can cause confusion and legal disputes about warranty claims.",

MMI shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages unless caused by intention or gross negligence.",
                "changed_text": "Either party shall be liable for failure or delay in performance of its duties under this Agreement, regardless of the reason. MMI shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages unless caused by intention or gross negligence.",
                "explanation": "The original text included an exception for liability due to reasons beyond a party's reasonable control (force majeure). The modified text removes this exception, making both parties strictly liable for any failure or delay, even if caused by unforeseen circumstances. Other clauses in the agreement might assume the possibility of force majeure, thus creating a contradiction and uncertainty about the parties' obligations under different circumstances.",

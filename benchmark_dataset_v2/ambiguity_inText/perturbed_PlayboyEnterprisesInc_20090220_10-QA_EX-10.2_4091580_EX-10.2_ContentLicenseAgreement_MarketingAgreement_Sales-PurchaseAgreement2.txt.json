By execution of this Supplier/Subcontractor Contract (\"Contract\"), _______________ (\"Supplier\")  agrees and  acknowledges that: (i) all images and/or trademarks, including, but not limited to PLAYBOY, (the \"Playboy Properties\")  applied at the request of _______________ (\"Purchaser\")  to merchandise covered by this Contract are owned by  Playboy Enterprises International, Inc.

                "explanation": "The modification changes 'means that' to 'may be interpreted to mean that,' introducing ambiguity about the endorsement status of merchandise bearing Playboy Properties. This creates a contradiction because section 7 implies strict adherence to the branding guidelines, whereas this change introduces uncertainty about the implication of using Playboy properties.",

                "explanation": "The added phrase '*MAY OR MAY NOT*' introduces a contradiction regarding the consequences of violating the agreement. The original text suggests possible prosecution, whereas the modified text makes the outcomes highly uncertain and discretionary. This makes obligations described elsewhere in the contract less enforceable.",

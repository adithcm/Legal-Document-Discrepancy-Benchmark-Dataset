                "explanation": "Removing the clauses 4.7 (the second part) and 4.11 (the second part) and 4.12 (all subclauses) introduces ambiguity. In 4.7 by removing the part, it is not clear to customer about what happens when service provider fails to change the tyre with equal to or less than 2mm. In 4.11 by removing the part, it is not clear to customer whether if something damaged through driver abuse it has to be taken care by service provider or customer. In 4.12 by removing subclauses, it is not clear on what specific repairs are included and covered. So, it would be difficult for customer or legal party to take a decission.",

                "explanation": "Changing the terms in this section introduces ambiguity around payment terms. Changing 'in advance' to 'in arrears' in 3.3 and fourteen days to thirty days, delays the cashflow, and it contradicts with the existing practice. Increasing the '3%' to '5%' would lead to disputes between customer and service provider. Similarly, in 3.4 changing the duration from 'two weeks' to 'one month' is creating inconsistency in agreement. 3.5 changing the 'first day' to 'second day' would lead to disputes. So, it would be difficult for customer or legal party to take a decission.",

                "explanation": "Modifying the definitions creates several in-text contradictions. 'Act' definition changed from '1996' to '2000', the calculation of additional charges is now 'fixed' instead of 'time and materials', 'Agreement' term is excluding the schedules and appendix. 'Bodywork' includes materials supplied by original vehicle manufacturer. Chassis means only main frame of vehicle. Similarly contracted period and date are changed. All these contradicting with actual agreement between service provider and customer and could potentially lead to disputes.",

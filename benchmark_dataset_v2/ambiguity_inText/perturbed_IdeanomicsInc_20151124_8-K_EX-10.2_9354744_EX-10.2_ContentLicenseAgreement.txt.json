                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Territory'. In Section 1(n), it is defined as mainland China. However, the added clause states that for titles listed in Schedule A4, it means worldwide excluding North America. This creates ambiguity about the geographical scope of the license for Schedule A4 titles, leading to uncertainty in enforcement.",

However, Licensor shall have unrestricted access to and ownership of all aggregated, anonymized data derived from these Reports for its own business purposes.",
                "explanation": "This adds a contradictory statement regarding the ownership and usage of the data contained in the Reports. Initially, the section states that the Reports and their information are Confidential Information owned by the Licensee. The modification grants Licensor ownership and unrestricted access to aggregated, anonymized data. This creates a conflict on ownership and usage between the two parties, potentially leading to disputes over data privacy, competitive advantage, and confidentiality.",

Licensee shall be fully liable for all the titles, whether there's a breach of the agreement or not.",
                "explanation": "This changes the allocation of legal liability, creating a conflict. The first part of the section states that the Licensor is responsible for legal liabilities, except in cases of Licensee's breach or gross negligence. However, the modified section introduces an opposing statement, saying that Licensee shall be fully liable for all the titles. This generates confusion over responsibility for legal claims related to the Titles, making it unclear which party bears the burden of legal defense and financial payouts.",

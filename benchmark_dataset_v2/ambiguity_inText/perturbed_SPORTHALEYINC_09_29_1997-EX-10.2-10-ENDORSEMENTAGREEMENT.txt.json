The Professional agrees that, with respect to men's apparel,          he will exclusively endorse and use exclusively in play, practice,           exhibits, clinics and other events open to the media or public, Haley           brand apparel which shall consist of shirts, vests, jackets, sweaters,          pants and shorts (if permitted by applicable rules).",
                "changed_text": "The Professional agrees to perform the          following services during the term of this Agreement:\n\n              a.  The Professional agrees that, with respect to men's apparel,          he will use Haley brand apparel, if available, in play, practice,           exhibits, clinics and other events open to the media or public. This includes shirts, vests, jackets, sweaters, pants, and shorts.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by removing the 'exclusively endorse and use exclusively' language and replacing it with a conditional statement 'if available'. This makes the endorsement obligation non-binding, creating conflict with the intended exclusivity. It is contradictory if elsewhere in the document it suggests exclusivity is required.",

                "changed_text": "Following the expiration of 90 days from the termination or          expiration of this Agreement, the Company is encouraged to cease usage of all publicity, promotion and advertising materials which contain the          Professional's Image. The Company retains the right to use any remaining publicity, promotion or advertising materials indefinitely.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the Company 'shall cease usage' after 90 days but also allows using what 'shall then be available' during those 90 days. The modified text introduces a conflict by stating that the Company is only 'encouraged' to cease usage and retains the right to use materials 'indefinitely'. It creates confusion on how long the company has to stop showing old publicity, promotion and adverts after the contract is over.",

                "original_text": "In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties          and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties          acknowledge and agree that any such dispute shall be submitted for           binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedures           established by the American arbitration Association in Denver,           Colorado.  If such association is not then in existence, an           independent association of arbitrators may be utilized  which is           designated by agreement of the parties. In the event the parties are           unable to agree on an independent association of arbitrators, either           party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for appointment          of arbitrators.",
                "changed_text": "In the event of any dispute which arises between the parties          and which relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, the parties will attempt to resolve the issue through direct negotiation. If direct negotiation fails, the parties may consider non-binding mediation. Litigation is also a potential avenue for dispute resolution.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates binding arbitration, removing other options. The changed text suggests negotiation, mediation, and litigation as alternatives, making the dispute resolution process unclear and non-compulsory. The conflict lies in whether disputes *must* go to binding arbitration, or if it is simply an option, and thus creates uncertainty regarding the enforcement of the agreement.",

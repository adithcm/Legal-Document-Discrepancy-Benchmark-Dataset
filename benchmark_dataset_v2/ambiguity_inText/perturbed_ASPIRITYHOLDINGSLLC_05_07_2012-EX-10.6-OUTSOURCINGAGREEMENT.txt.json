As applicable to the context in which this term is used, those procedures and practices with respect  to the servicing and administration of the Notes that satisfy the following: (i) the use of reasonable care; (ii) compliance with  all Governmental Rules; (iii) compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Indenture; and (iv) give due  consideration to the accepted standards of practice of prudent servicing firms that service or administer comparable programs  for publicly offered notes or securities and the reliance of the Company on the Contractor for the servicing and administration  of the Renewable Note Program.",

As applicable to the context in which this term is used, those procedures and practices with respect to the servicing and administration of the Notes that satisfy the following: (i) the use of industry-standard care; (ii) compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Indenture; and (iii) give due consideration to internal standards. The Contractor has full autonomy to decide its internal standards.",
                "explanation": "The first definition stipulates 'reasonable care,' compliance with 'all Governmental Rules,' and consideration of accepted industry standards. The second definition modifies the level of care to 'industry-standard care,' removes the compliance with 'all Governmental Rules' and shifts the focus to internal standards determined by the contractor, creating ambiguity regarding the required standard of care and regulatory compliance. This creates a contradiction as one section mandates external standards while the other prioritizes internal ones.",

The Contractor shall establish and maintain at all times during the term of this  Agreement files and records (including, without limitation, computerized records) regarding the Notes and the Note Portfolio, with full and correct  entries of all transactions or modifications in a reasonably secure, up-to-date manner and in accordance with the following:\n     (d) Retention. Unless otherwise requested by the Company, or unless otherwise required by Governmental Rules, the  Contractor shall retain, with respect to each Note, for a period of 24 months from the date the Note is fully paid, all records, files and documents related to each such Note.",

                "explanation": "The original text states that the Contractor should retain records for 24 months unless otherwise requested by the Company or required by Governmental Rules. The modified text changes the retention period to a fixed 6 months, removing the conditions for longer retention. This contradicts the original clause and any Governmental Rules that may require a longer retention period, creating uncertainty about the applicable retention policy.",

The Company or the Contractor may terminate this Agreement at any time in whole or in part as more  specifically provided below, and in such case, the Contractor will be paid fees incurred up to the date of such termination plus its expenses  accrued as of such date within 30 days of such termination.

                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the Contractor will be paid fees incurred up to the date of termination plus expenses within 30 days. The modified text removes this sentence, creating uncertainty about compensation upon termination. This directly contradicts the initial compensation agreement, as it is unclear if the Contractor is still entitled to payment or reimbursement, potentially leading to disputes over outstanding dues.",

                "original_text": "1. Definitions. As used herein, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: (a) \"Contract Period\" shall mean that period of time commencing as of May 31, 1999 and concluding May 31, 2000.",
                "changed_text": "1. Definitions. As used herein, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: (a) \"Contract Period\" shall mean that period of time commencing as of May 31, 1999 and concluding May 31, 2000, unless otherwise extended by mutual written agreement of both parties.",
                "explanation": "This change adds an exception to the definition of 'Contract Period'. While the original definition specifies a fixed period, the modified version allows for extensions, creating ambiguity about the actual duration of the agreement. This contradicts the explicit nature of the initial definition, leading to potential disputes over the term of the agreement.",

Unless such election has been made in writing, all payments shall be made by check drawn to the order of \"Pey Dirt, Inc.\" and delivered to IMG, Suite 100, 1360 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Attn.: Peter Johnson.",

(a) All payments shall be made by check drawn to the order of \"Pey Dirt, Inc.\" and delivered to IMG, Suite 100, 1360 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Attn.: Peter Johnson. However, Pey Dirt reserves the right to request payments via wire transfer on a case-by-case basis, subject to Famous Fixins, Inc.'s approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.",
                "explanation": "The original text establishes the primary payment method as check, with an allowance for Pey Dirt to elect other methods in writing. The modified version states all payments should be done via check but allows wire transfers in some cases if Famous Fixins, Inc approves. This creates confusion regarding the standard payment procedure and the circumstances under which Pey Dirt can request or be forced to accept alternative payment methods.",

(a) If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: as to subparagraph (i) if such payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment, or as to subparagraph (ii) if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default.",

(a) If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement; however, the defaulting party shall be given a reasonable opportunity to cure such default, not to exceed thirty (30) days, as determined by mutual agreement between the parties.",
                "explanation": "The original clause specifies clear cure periods for payment and non-payment defaults. The modified clause replaces these with a 'reasonable opportunity' not exceeding thirty days, but the length of the period is dependent upon the mutual agreement of both parties. This introduces ambiguity and potential disputes because the determination of what constitutes a 'reasonable opportunity' is subjective, especially in scenarios where both parties disagree on this matter, thus making the conditions of default unclear.",

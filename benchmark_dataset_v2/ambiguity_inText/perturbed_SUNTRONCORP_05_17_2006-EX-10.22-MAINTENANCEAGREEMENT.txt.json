                "changed_text": "\"Required Capital Contributions\" means only unrestricted cash contributions to the capital of one or more of the Borrowers made by the Investor, as required under Section 2 below, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 during the first year of this Agreement, and may include Qualified Subordinated Loans in subsequent years.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Required Capital Contributions.' Initially, it includes both cash contributions and Qualified Subordinated Loans. The modified definition restricts Qualified Subordinated Loans to only being permitted in subsequent years, potentially conflicting with other sections that may rely on the original broader definition throughout the term of the agreement. This could lead to disputes over what constitutes a valid Required Capital Contribution in the first year.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. The Agent further acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether other \"Events of Default\" (as defined therein) have occurred and are continuing under the Financing Agreement, in no event shall the Investor be obligated to make any Required Capital Contributions hereunder if the Borrowers have fully complied with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter for the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable).",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the total capital contribution limit. The original text states that the limit is $5,000,000 'during the term of this Agreement', which is meant for a period of more than a year. The change implies that the limit applies 'during each 12 Month Period of this Agreement'. This creates uncertainty as to whether the Investor is liable for $5,000,000 each year or just over the lifetime of the agreement, making it less clear what their maximum contribution might be.",

                "explanation": "This change adds a fourth termination condition: '5 years from the effective date'. This directly conflicts with the condition (i), which states that the agreement terminates when the aggregate Required Capital Contributions equals $5,000,000 and condition (iii), which stipulates termination upon full payment of obligations. If the $5,000,000 is reached before 5 years or the obligations are paid within 5 years, it becomes unclear which termination condition takes precedence, causing legal uncertainty and disputes regarding when the agreement officially ends.",

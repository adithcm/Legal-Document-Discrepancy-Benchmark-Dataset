                "explanation": "The original definition defines 'Approved Location' as the 'street address' while the modified definition changes it to 'general vicinity'. This contradiction introduces ambiguity because the franchisee now has two contradicting elements for Approved Location making it unclear as to what is the definitive geographical constraint for the operations of the franchise, potentially leading to conflicts.",

However, the modified definition states 'charged by us,' meaning the franchisor. This contradiction will lead to conflict on who controls the fee and who is actually charging them. This affects payment process and revenue allocation.",

Before starting any activities or operations under this Agreement, you agree to procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement (and for such period thereafter as is necessary to provide the coverages required under this Agreement for events having occurred during the Term of this Agreement), at your expense, at least the following insurance policy or policies in connection with the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises, or by reason of the construction, operation, or occupancy of the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises.",

Before starting any activities or operations under this Agreement, the Franchisor agrees to procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement (and for such period thereafter as is necessary to provide the coverages required under this Agreement for events having occurred during the Term of this Agreement), at Franchisor's expense, at least the following insurance policy or policies in connection with the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises, or by reason of the construction, operation, or occupancy of the Franchised Business or other facilities on premises.",
                "explanation": "The original text states the franchisee is responsible for acquiring the insurance while the modified text transfers this responsibility to the franchisor. This is a material contradiction that can have significant impacts, especially relating to the cost allocation. It's highly disputable and could void the obligations of the franchisee.",

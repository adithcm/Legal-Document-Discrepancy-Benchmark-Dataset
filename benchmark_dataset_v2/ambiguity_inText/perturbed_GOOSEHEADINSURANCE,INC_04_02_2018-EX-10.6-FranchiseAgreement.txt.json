The Royalty Fee will be the following amounts: (a) the greater of (i) twenty percent (20%) of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term, or (ii) the Minimum Royalty (defined below); and (b) fifty percent (50%) of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms and policies written for existing customers on the same risk profile within a one-year period of the cancellation of their existing policy (also known as \"re-writes\").",

                "explanation": "The original definition states that the Royalty Fee is the *greater* of 20% of Gross Revenues *or* the Minimum Royalty for initial term policies. The changed text removes the “greater of” clause, and the “Minimum Royalty” clause altogether, resulting in a contradiction. In effect, one section implies a minimum payment that another negates, causing potential dispute.",

                "explanation": "The modified excerpt has changed the minimum limits of commercial general liability insurance. This introduces ambiguity as the initial sentence specifies the insurance policies must include “at a minimum” all listed requirements, but the listed minimum amounts for liability insurance are changed, contradicting the implied standard. This may cause a dispute about the insurance coverage amount that is required.",

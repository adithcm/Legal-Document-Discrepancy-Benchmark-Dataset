                "changed_text": "2.2 Distributor will use reasonable efforts to develop the local market and promote the sales of Products within the Territory. Distributor will not sell outside the Territory; any sales outside the designated Territory will result in immediate termination of this agreement.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that Distributor will use best efforts and requires Tripath's permission for sales outside the territory, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The modified version introduces a stricter condition where any sale outside the territory results in termination, contradicting the initial flexibility. This creates uncertainty as to what constitutes permissible sales activity.",

                "changed_text": "7.1 Distributor will maintain minimal inventory of Products (specifically, only enough to fulfill confirmed pre-orders), as Tripath will ensure direct shipment to end-customers. Distributor's inventory level does not need Tripath's approval.",
                "explanation": "The original text requires the Distributor to maintain sufficient inventory, not less than one month's worth, unless Tripath approves otherwise. The changed text mandates minimal inventory and direct shipment by Tripath, eliminating the inventory requirement and need for Tripath's approval. This creates a contradiction about inventory obligations.",

                "changed_text": "18.2 Tripath may terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty days written notice. Distributor can only terminate this Agreement if Tripath breaches the contract.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows either party to terminate for any reason with 30 days' notice. The modified version restricts the Distributor's ability to terminate, limiting it to cases where Tripath breaches the contract, while Tripath retains the right to terminate for any reason. This introduces an inconsistent condition for termination between the parties.",

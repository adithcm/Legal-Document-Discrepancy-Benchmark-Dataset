                "original_text": "1.2. \"Affiliate\" means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with either Party hereto. For purpose of this definition, \"control\" shall mean ownership of over fifty percent (50%) of the equity capital, the outstanding voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity, or the right to receive over fifty percent (50%) of the profits or earnings of an entity. In the case of non-stock organizations, the term \"control\" shall mean the power to control the distribution of profits.",
                "changed_text": "1.2. \"Affiliate\" means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with either Party hereto. For purpose of this definition, \"control\" shall mean ownership of over fifty percent (50%) of the equity capital, the outstanding voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity, or the right to receive over fifty percent (50%) of the profits or earnings of an entity. However, for the purposes of Section 8 (Indemnification), 'control' shall mean ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) of the equity capital, the outstanding voting securities or other ownership interest of an entity. In the case of non-stock organizations, the term \"control\" shall mean the power to control the distribution of profits.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'control' within the definition of 'Affiliate'. The primary definition sets the control threshold at over 50%, while a secondary clause within the same definition lowers the threshold to 25% specifically for Section 8 (Indemnification). This creates ambiguity as to which threshold applies when determining affiliate status, especially concerning indemnification responsibilities.  It is uncertain if the broader definition of Affiliate or the narrower definition applies for indemnity purposes.",

                "changed_text": "4.4. Payment Terms. HOVIONE shall invoice INTERSECT upon dispatch of the API. INTERSECT shall pay the price to HOVIONE for API within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of invoice of such API if INTERSECT is satisfied with the API quality and the API performs properly, otherwise the payment will be done based on mutual agreement. Payments shall be made to HOVIONE by wire transfer.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the Payment Terms. Initially, payment is due within thirty (30) calendar days of the invoice date. The modified version introduces a condition that allows INTERSECT to defer payment to sixty (60) days, or even longer based on 'mutual agreement,' depending on satisfaction with the API quality and performance. This contradicts the original fixed payment term and creates uncertainty about when payment is actually due.",

Within thirty (30) calendar days of the arrival of each lot of API at the manufacturing facility designated by INTERSECT, INTERSECT shall inspect and test each lot of API at its own cost and expense. If, upon inspecting and testing the API, INTERSECT determines that a lot of API does not conform to the Product Specifications, then INTERSECT shall, within such thirty (30) day period, give HOVIONE written notice of such non-conformity (setting forth the details of such non-conformity):Unless HOVIONE objects, within 20 working days from the notice by INTERSECT, to the non-conformity INTERSECT will return the non-conforming API to HOVIONE.",

Within thirty (30) calendar days of the arrival of each lot of API at the manufacturing facility designated by INTERSECT, INTERSECT shall inspect and test each lot of API at its own cost and expense. If, upon inspecting and testing the API, INTERSECT subjectively determines that a lot of API does not conform to the Product Specifications, then INTERSECT shall, within such sixty (60) day period, give HOVIONE verbal notice of such non-conformity without setting forth the details of such non-conformity:Unless HOVIONE agrees within 5 working days from the notice by INTERSECT, to the non-conformity INTERSECT can reship the API to another facility.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces several contradictions regarding the API inspection process. The original text mandates a 30-day inspection period and written notice of non-conformity with detailed specifications. The modification changes the inspection from objective to subjective, extends the notification period to 60 days, requires verbal notice without details, reduces response time from Hovione to 5 days and allows INTERSECT to reship the API if HOVIONE doesn't agree with the API.",

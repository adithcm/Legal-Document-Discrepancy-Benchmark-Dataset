An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity or when it controls, on its own or jointly, the majority of the composition of the Board of Directors of such other entity.",

An entity controls another entity when it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the equity share capital issued and outstanding of the other entity. \n\n5.6 IMPCO shall at all times be entitled to invite any of its Affiliates, managerial, technical or financial personnel to attend the Board meetings of the JVC. For the purpose of this section ONLY, \"Affiliate(s)\" shall mean any entity where IMPCO has at least 25% ownership, or is otherwise deemed an affiliate under standard accounting practices.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of 'Affiliate(s)'. In Section 1.1, the standard definition requires 51% or more equity share capital for control. However, Section 5.6 introduces a different, less strict definition for the specific purpose of board meeting attendance, requiring only 25% ownership or deemed affiliation under accounting practices. This creates ambiguity as to who qualifies as an affiliate in different contexts within the agreement. It will create an enforcement issue, because what constitutes an affiliate, 51% vs. 25% control, when considering IMPCO inviting a group into the board meetings. ",

The modified text says the Agreement will automatically terminate. This creates an inconsistency in the document, because there is a discussion element, that is no longer there. If an enforcement issue were to arise, there would be a dispute as to whether the agreement has the option to mutually decide to continue. ",

The Parties agree that the shares held by them may be pledged to a third party or otherwise encumbered during the term of this Agreement, if it is for the benefit of the JVC. In the event the pledge of shares of any Party is necessitated for the purposes of the JVC, the third party can request the shares with the prior written consent and on terms acceptable to only IMPCO. ",
                "explanation": "Article 6.1(a) indicates shares can only be transferred as the agreement outlines and the M&A, while Article 6.1(c) states there is no transfer of shares allowed for five years except as already noted. Article 6.5 states shares cannot be pledged or encumbered, UNLESS there is prior written consent from all the parties. The change now says IMPCO only can accept terms, which puts this section in contradiction with 6.1(a). This creates an enforcement issue, as someone can argue that this overrides article 6.1. ",

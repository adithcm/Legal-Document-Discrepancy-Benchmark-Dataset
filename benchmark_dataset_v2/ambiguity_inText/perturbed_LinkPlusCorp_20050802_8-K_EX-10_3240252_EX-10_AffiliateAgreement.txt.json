                "original_text": "3.4      Manufacturing: During the term of this Agreement, Axiometric                   shall issue a Request for Manufacture (RFM) for any AMR                   hardware to be sold by Axiometric under the terms of this                   Agreement. The RFM shall specify delivered product cost,                   credit requirements, delivery schedules, warranty service,                   quality using industry standard terms, and other industry                   standard manufacturing requirements. As the preferred                   manufacturer, LKPL shall have first right of refusal on all                   such RFMs. If LKPL does not respond to an RFM within thirty                   (30) days, or cannot provide competitive terms (such as cost,                   credit, quality, schedule), Axiometric will be free to award                   the manufacturing contract to an alternate manufacturer.",
                "changed_text": "3.4      Manufacturing: During the term of this Agreement, Axiometric                   shall issue a Request for Manufacture (RFM) for any AMR                   hardware to be sold by Axiometric under the terms of this                   Agreement.

                "explanation": "The modified text states that LKPL 'will have right to manufacture all' RFMs, directly contradicting the original clause that allows Axiometric to use an alternate manufacturer if LKPL cannot provide competitive terms or does not respond within 30 days. This creates ambiguity and potentially restricts Axiometric's options unreasonably.",

If no extension is agreed upon, the agreement will be considered permanently terminated.",
                "explanation": "The original agreement stated the term was for perpetuity, whereas this new version stipulates a term of five years with automatic termination if no extension is mutually agreed upon. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the duration of the agreement, which could lead to disputes about its validity after five years.",

                "explanation": "The original definition prioritized definitions within the text, stating that 'if other terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them'. Now, the text prioritizes exhibit A definitions, saying that if any other definition of term is defined, it is an example, creating a contradiction for which definition prevails. ",

                "explanation": "By removing 'efficient' from the initial requirement and adding 'The Service Provider can choose the best and most economical way for the maintenance', the contract introduces ambiguity. While the original text mandated efficiency, the edited version permits the Service Provider to prioritize cost savings over efficiency, potentially leading to disputes.",

                "explanation": "By changing 'require the immediate removal and permanent expulsion' to 'Determination on removing and expelling a person for the possession of firearms, alcohol or illegal drugs at the Premises is at the discretion of the Service Provider' creates an internal contradiction and weakens the original zero-tolerance policy. The original text mandated a strict response, while the modified version grants the service provider discretion, potentially leading to inconsistent enforcement.",

The modified version extends the payment timeline and introduces uncertainty around the interest rate on late payments. This creates a conflict and ambiguity, as itâ€™s unclear when payments are truly considered past due and how the interest rate will be calculated, potentially leading to disputes over payment terms.",

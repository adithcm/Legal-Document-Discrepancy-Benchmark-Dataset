Service Provider shall perform the maintenance portion of the Services in a clean, safe, efficient and  environmentally reasonable manner and maintain the SEF in good operating and mechanical condition in accordance with this Agreement and (i)  all applicable laws and permits, (ii) all applicable express warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who  provided materials or labor under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement dated September 30, 2009 (the \"EPC Agreement\")  for the SEF subject to the terms and limitations thereof, and (iii) all manufacturer's maintenance instructions and specifications.",
                "changed_text": "1.2 Performance of Maintenance Services. Service Provider shall perform the maintenance portion of the Services in a clean and safe manner. The Service Provider will aim to maintain the SEF in generally acceptable operating condition, taking into account budget constraints and readily available resources. The maintenance will be performed in accordance with this Agreement and (i) all recommended applicable laws and permits, (ii) commercially reasonable efforts will be made to adhere to all applicable express warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who  provided materials or labor under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement dated September 30, 2009 (the \"EPC Agreement\")  for the SEF subject to the terms and limitations thereof, and (iii) reasonable consideration to all manufacturer's maintenance instructions and specifications.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates a specific standard of 'good operating and mechanical condition' and strict adherence to warranties and manufacturer's instructions. The modified text introduces ambiguity by using phrases like 'generally acceptable operating condition', 'taking into account budget constraints', and 'commercially reasonable efforts,' creating an internal contradiction. This creates uncertainty as to the required standard of maintenance.",

Service Provider shall make the SEF O&M Reports available to Owner in the format as determined by the service provider.",
                "explanation": "The original text specifies a strict timeline of 'within ten (10) business days' for providing SEF O&M Reports and requires both hard copy and electronic formats. The modified text replaces this with vague terms like 'as soon as practical' and 'reasonable timeframe' and give the service provider the ability to pick what format to send the reports. This contradiction creates ambiguity regarding the timeliness and format requirements for the reports.",

                "explanation": "The original text specifies a 'thirty (30) days' written notice' to terminate after the Initial Term. The modified text changes this to 'sixty (60) days' written notice, but preferably 90 days'. This creates a contradiction about the exact duration of the notice period required for termination, potentially leading to disputes over the validity of a termination notice.",

                "original_text": "The following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below throughout this Agreement:\n\n\"Affiliate\" means, with respect to any person, any other person who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such person. The term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms \"controlled\" and \"controlling\" have meanings correlative thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Agreement and all exhibits thereto, the term Affiliate shall not apply to the relationship between RGHI or RGHL or either of their respective Affiliates on the one hand and RCP and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on the other hand.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction by limiting the exclusion of Affiliates to only Article I, whereas the original text excludes it from the entire agreement. This could lead to disputes over whether the Affiliate definition applies in other articles, specifically concerning liabilities and services.",

Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days' prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider's purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.

                "explanation": "By removing the phrase 'unless otherwise indicated therein', the contract introduces a contradiction. Initially, it allowed for the possibility of services in Section G1 to have specific termination conditions outlined within the exhibit. Removing this clause makes it seem that ALL services described in G1 can ONLY be terminated by an agreed Migration Plan, regardless of what the exhibit says about the termination of services. This creates an inconsistency that could be disputed.",

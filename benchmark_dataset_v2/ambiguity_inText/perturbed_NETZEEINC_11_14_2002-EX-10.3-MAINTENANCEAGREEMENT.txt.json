                "changed_text": "Bankers Bank agrees to pay fees equal to $40 per month for all Participating Banks (original or added) for which maintenance is actively and successfully provided, verified by monthly reports. However, in cases where the system's uptime falls below 99% in a given month, the fee will be reduced by 50% for that month for the affected Participating Banks.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction regarding payment. The original text states a fixed fee, while the modified text introduces a variable fee based on uptime, creating ambiguity about the actual payment amount. It is unclear if the reduction in fee applies to all months with downtime or if the original fee applies regardless of the uptime. This affects Bankers Bank's financial obligations.",

                "changed_text": "Maintenance provided by Netzee during the term of this Agreement shall include (1) standard maintenance upgrades and modifications offered by Netzee to its customers generally. However, Netzee is only obligated to provide these upgrades and modifications if they are deemed essential for the core functionality of the system, as determined solely by Netzee's internal assessment. (2) 5x12 call-in support between hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday, (3) in the event of material discrepancies between the Services as provided and the specifications for such Services (which shall be furnished in reasonably acceptable form), reasonable effort (in relation to importance, impact, and scheduled development plans) to correct those discrepancies, and (4) availability of basic Services with at least 99% uptime between 4:00 a.m Monday and 7:00 p.m. Friday and between 8:00 a.m. Saturday and 2:00 p.m. Saturday Eastern Time, exclusive of outages caused by off-peak prescheduled maintenance or causes beyond Netzee's reasonable control (including third-party equipment or communications).",
                "explanation": "The original text implies that Netzee will provide standard upgrades. The modified text adds a clause that Netzee's obligation is contingent on its own assessment of 'essential' need. This creates a conflict and uncertainty; another part of the contract may enforce the updates but this new part now makes it subjective and gives all power to Netzee. It's unclear what happens if Bankers Bank disagrees with Netzee's assessment, leading to potential disputes over what constitutes adequate maintenance. The term 'essential' is vague.",

Specifically, the uptime requirements and payment reductions stipulated herein take precedence.",
                "explanation": "The original text states that the maintenance agreement is governed by the Master Agreement. The modified text introduces an exception, stating that the maintenance agreement's terms regarding service levels and payment schedules supersede the Master Agreement in case of conflict. This creates a contradiction. The original text says Master Agreement rules all and the change says this agreement rules specific instances creating an internal contradiction. This could lead to disputes over which agreement's terms apply in specific situations, especially concerning liability or warranty issues.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a conflicting definition of 'net sales'. Originally, net sales are explicitly defined as 'gross sales minus returns'. The modification defines 'net sales' as 'total revenue,' which generally encompasses all income without deducting for returns. This contradiction makes it unclear which definition should be used for calculating royalties, leading to disputes over payments.",

                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction regarding the duration of royalty payments. The original text states royalty payments continue 'in perpetuity' for as long as the products are sold, implying an indefinite period. The changed text limits this by stating that royalty payments will only continue for a shorter period of either ten years or as long as the products are sold, introducing ambiguity about when the payments cease, which could create conflict.",

The mediation shall take place no more than sixty (60) days after written notice from the party requesting such mediation. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted in Phoenix, Arizona under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the AAA shall not mediate or arbitrate the dispute, and the parties shall agree upon a mediator and arbitrator, if necessary, but if the parties cannot agree upon such mediator or arbitrator, Judicial Dispute Resolution of Phoenix, AZ shall select one of its mediators/arbitrators to serve pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Maricopa County, Arizona for such equitable, extraordinary or injunctive relief as may be necessary to enforce the respective rights of the parties under this Agreement. The prevailing party in arbitration or litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, as determined by the arbitrator or judge, as applicable.",

Should negotiation fail, the parties shall then engage in mediation conducted wherever is most convenient for Dr. Murray. The mediation shall take place no more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the start of conflict. Any disputes remaining unresolved after mediation shall be subject to non-binding arbitration conducted in Seattle, Washington under rules agreed by Dr. Murray. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) all disputes must be initially presented to the American Arbitration Association, and (ii) EHS or EHN alone may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Delaware for such equitable, extraordinary or injunctive relief as may be necessary to enforce the respective rights of the parties under this Agreement. The prevailing party in litigation, but not arbitration, shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, as determined by the judge, as applicable.",
                "explanation": "This introduces multiple contradictions related to dispute resolution. First, it changes 'shall first attempt to resolve' via mediation to 'may, at their sole discretion, attempt to resolve' via direct negotiation, making the initial step optional. It also changes the location of mediation to wherever Dr. Murray is most comfortable. It now specifies the dispute shall be presented initially to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), contradicting that the mediation shall happen wherever Murray is most comfortable, while also contradicting the original (i) in that previously AAA was not meant to mediate or arbitrate the dispute. Also, it now allows EHS or EHN alone to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in Delaware, and makes arbitration non-binding.",

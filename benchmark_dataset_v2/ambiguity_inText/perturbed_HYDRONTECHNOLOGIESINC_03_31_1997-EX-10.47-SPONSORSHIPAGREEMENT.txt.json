TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\n                  1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of the Dolphins 2000 regular season or post season, if applicable (the \"Term\" or \"Initial Term\"). However, this Agreement may be earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.",
                "changed_text": "1.       TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\n                  1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of the Dolphins 2000 regular season or post season, if applicable (the \"Term\" or \"Initial Term\"). This Agreement may only be terminated as specifically outlined in Section 8.",
                "explanation": "The original text allows for termination \"in accordance with the provisions hereof,\" implying multiple termination routes. The modified text states the agreement \"may only be terminated as specifically outlined in Section 8\", thus restricting termination rights. This creates a contradiction if other sections implicitly or explicitly suggest alternative termination scenarios.",

USE OF MARKS\n\n                  4.1 Hydron and the Dolphins may use the name, logos, colors, trademarks, service marks, or other identifying features (\"Marks\") of the other, as specifically contemplated in connection with the Sponsorship Rights, subject to any limitations set forth in this Agreement.",

                "explanation": "The original text says parties 'may use' each others marks. The modified version states 'shall use' the marks as 'deemed necessary' creating an ambiguity between whether using the marks is optional, or a requirement. If Section 2.2 lists a number of conditions where the marks must be displayed, this new modification may conflict with it.",

MISCELLANEOUS\n\n                  9.6 No party may assign any of its rights or obligations\n\nhereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Hydron may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to its parent, its successor or to an affiliate (as such term is defined under the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal securities laws of the U.S.) upon the reasonable consent of the Dolphins that such affiliate assignee has the financial means and corporate authority to perform such obligations and Hydron may not withhold its consent to an assignment of this Agreement in the event of a merger or reorganization of the Dolphins, a sale of all or substantially all of the Dolphins' assets or a consolidation of the Dolphins with any of its affiliates or related parties.",

MISCELLANEOUS\n\n                  9.6 No party may assign any of its rights or obligations\n\nhereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any entity without the need for consent.",
                "explanation": "The original text has a clause stating that there is 'no party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without prior written consent.' while simultaneously stating that Hydron can assign its rights to its parent, successor or to an affiliate. The changed text now states that either party can assign its rights to any entity without the need for consent, creating a direct conflict with the initial statement. This creates ambiguity on when, to whom, and under what circumstances assignment is permissible.",

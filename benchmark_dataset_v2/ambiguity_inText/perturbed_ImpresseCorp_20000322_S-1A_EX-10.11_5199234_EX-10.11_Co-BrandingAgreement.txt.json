                "explanation": "The definition of 'USER' is initially a simple access. The addition creates a conflicting definition: requiring registration/contact for revenue sharing. This creates uncertainty whether a simple site visitor counts as a user or not in terms of revenue sharing.",

                "explanation": "This adds a second, contradictory term for termination. The original requires a cure period for breaches, but the addition allows VerticalNet to terminate immediately based on Impresse's reputation, creating conflict about when termination requires notice/cure vs. being immediate.",

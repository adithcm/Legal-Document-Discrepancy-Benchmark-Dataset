                "original_text": "Party B will register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County before implementing the project; Party A will offer all the preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction.",
                "changed_text": "Party B is encouraged to register a foreign-funded company in Fenyi County before implementing the project; Party A will offer some preferential policies to the company as per local investment promotion policies for foreign investment introduction.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Party B *will* register a company, making it a requirement. The modified text changes it to 'is encouraged,' creating ambiguity about whether registration is mandatory. Similarly, 'all the preferential policies' becomes 'some preferential policies,' making the extent of support unclear. This creates uncertainty regarding Party B's obligations and Party A's commitment.",

                "changed_text": "Party A supports the project construction and development of Party B, and will endeavor to provide preferential policies and service in the aspects of preliminary work, construction and grid-connected of the project, and coordinate with relevant departments and units to assist Party B with project construction progress.",
                "explanation": "The original text uses strong language ('guarantees,' 'most preferential policies,' 'all-round service,' 'actively coordinate'). The modified version weakens these commitments ('supports' only, 'endeavor to provide,' 'coordinate with' instead of 'actively coordinate,' 'assist' instead of 'help accelerate'). This creates a contradiction if other parts of the agreement rely on the stronger initial commitments, as the level of support is now ambiguous.",

                "original_text": "Party B promises that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; comprehensive development will be carried out according to relevant national stipulations, such commercial crops will be interplanted as agriculture and forestry as well as medicinal materials; local employees will enjoy the priority to be employed; local building materials will be adopted and relevant expenses will be paid on schedule.",
                "changed_text": "Party B intends that land nature will not be changed for building large-scale PV grid-connected power generation project in the plot; development will be carried out as practical, incorporating, as much as possible, national stipulations. Local employees will be considered to be employed; local building materials will be considered and expenses paid.",
                "explanation": "The original text contains firm commitments from Party B, such as 'Party B promises', 'will be interplanted', and 'will be adopted'. The revised text reduces these obligations using phrasing that suggests intentions or considerations rather than guarantees, such as 'Party B intends', 'development will be carried out as practical', and 'will be considered'. If another section discusses penalties for changing land nature or for non-compliance with the original section, this creates a conflict.",

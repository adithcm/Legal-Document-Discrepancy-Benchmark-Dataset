This Agreement shall automatically extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (\"Renewal Term\") provided WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term.

This Agreement may extend for an additional two (2) years on the same terms herein (\"Renewal Term\") if WPT receives payments greater than twelve million U.S. dollars ($12,000,000) within the Initial Term, subject to mutual agreement by both parties at the time of renewal. The Initial Term is referred to as the \"Term.\"",
                "explanation": "The original text states the renewal is automatic if a certain condition is met. The modified text introduces a requirement for mutual agreement, creating a contradiction and making the renewal process ambiguous. This contradicts the original agreement that is laid out, and makes it hard to enforce. The meaning of 'Term' has been made ambiguous as well, as the Renewal Term would be included under the meaning in the original agreement, but not in the changed agreement.",

WPT or its affiliates shall not authorize a Zynga Competitor to commercially exploit the Licensed Property in connection with social poker gaming via a license similar to the license granted herein for the Term. A \"Zynga Competitor\" means: 1) Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd. Or Big Fish Games, Inc.; 2) HUUUGE Inc.; 3) Activision Blizzard, Inc., King.com Ltd. Or King.com (US) LLC; 4) Scientific Games Corporation; 5) Tencent Holdings Limited; and 6) Murka Ltd. The parties agree to work together in good faith to amend the definition of a Zynga Competitor if that meaning for Zynga reasonably changes during the Term.",

WPT or its affiliates shall make a reasonable effort to avoid authorizing a Zynga Competitor to commercially exploit the Licensed Property in connection with social poker gaming via a license similar to the license granted herein for the Term. A \"Zynga Competitor\" means companies primarily focused on direct competition with Zynga in social poker games, as reasonably determined by WPT, taking into account current market conditions. The parties may discuss the definition of a Zynga Competitor, but WPT retains the final determination.",
                "explanation": "The original text imposes a clear restriction on WPT regarding licensing to specific competitors. The modified text weakens this restriction by changing 'shall not authorize' to 'make a reasonable effort to avoid' and providing WPT with broader discretion in defining 'Zynga Competitor.' This contradicts the initial intent to prevent licensing to specific companies and introduce uncertainty. The original text had a defined list, which gave a clear definiton of the term 'Zynga Competitor', and now the revised definition is ambiguous.",

The Annual Minimum Guarantee shall be recoupable from such Royalties as are, or have become, paid to WPT.

The Annual Minimum Guarantee might be recoupable from such Royalties as are, or have become, paid to WPT, subject to further negotiation. For clarification, the Annual Minimum Guarantee may operate as an advance payment, at Zynga's discretion, such that when accrued Royalties exceed the Annual Minimum Guarantee payments already paid, then the excess Royalties could be paid by Zynga to WPT.",
                "explanation": "The original text states Zynga 'will' pay the Annual Minimum Guarantee, making it a firm obligation. The revised text changes 'will' to 'may' and introduces contingencies (financial performance) and discretion ('might be recoupable,' 'may operate'). This fundamentally contradicts the original obligation and makes the Annual Minimum Guarantee uncertain, as it is no longer clear if or when Zynga is required to pay it. This impacts enforcement by creating conflicting understandings of Zynga's payment responsibilities. The term 'Annual Minimum Guarantee' is now ambiguous, as it is no longer a guaranteed minimum.",

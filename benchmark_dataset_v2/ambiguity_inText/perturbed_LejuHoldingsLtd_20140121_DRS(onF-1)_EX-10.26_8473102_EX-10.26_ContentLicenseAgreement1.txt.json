                "original_text": "\"Business\" means an online real estate media platform in the PRC that (i) provides information and updates related to real estate, home furnishing and construction in the PRC and provides real estate, home furnishing and construction advertising services, and (ii) operates a business-to-business and business-to-consumer Internet platform targeting participants in the PRC real estate industry, in each case, as currently conducted or contemplated to be conducted on the websites owned or operated by Licensee or any of Licensee's Affiliates in the PRC.",
                "changed_text": "\"Business\" means an online platform in the PRC that (i) provides information and updates related to real estate, and (ii) may potentially operate a business-to-business Internet platform targeting participants in the PRC real estate industry. Whether or not the platform is actively maintained or updated is at the discretion of the Licensee.",
                "explanation": "The original definition explicitly defines the 'Business' as an online real estate media platform that actively provides information and advertising services. The modified definition weakens this by stating that the platform 'may potentially' operate a business-to-business platform and that updates are at the 'discretion of the Licensee.' This creates ambiguity as to what constitutes the 'Business' for the purpose of the agreement. Does it need to actively provide advertising services or updates? This contradiction creates uncertainty regarding the obligations of the Licensee.",

The specific implementation and interpretation of this policy will be subject to mutual agreement, with no guarantee of adherence to any particular timeline or standard.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates that the Licensee must adhere to the content distribution policy of the Licensor, with the same implementation period as Licensor's affiliates. The modified text replaces 'agrees to use' with 'agrees to endeavor to use,' weakening the obligation. It also introduces the condition that specific implementation is subject to mutual agreement 'with no guarantee of adherence to any particular timeline or standard.' This contradicts the original obligation for the Licensee to follow the Licensor's content distribution policy by removing any guaranteed adherence and introducing a subjective agreement process. It makes enforcement of the content distribution policy unclear.",

                "changed_text": "In maintaining the confidentiality of Confidential Information, the Recipient shall take steps it deems appropriate, but is not responsible to take similar steps to those it exercises with its own confidential information.",
                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Recipient must exercise at least a 'reasonable degree of care' when handling Confidential Information, with a benchmark being the care they use for their own confidential information. The modified text states they should take steps they 'deem appropriate' and are specifically 'not responsible to take similar steps to those it exercises with its own confidential information'. This introduces a contradiction. The original text imposes a clear standard of care, while the modification removes it, making the obligation to maintain confidentiality vague and difficult to enforce. What 'deem appropriate' means would be open to interpretation, potentially undermining the entire confidentiality clause.",

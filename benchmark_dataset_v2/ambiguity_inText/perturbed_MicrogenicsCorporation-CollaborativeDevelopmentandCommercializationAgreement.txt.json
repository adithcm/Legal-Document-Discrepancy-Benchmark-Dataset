                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" shall mean efforts and resources normally utilized by a Party for a product owned by it or to which it has rights, which is of similar market potential at a similar stage in its product life, taking into account the competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position of the product, the regulatory structure involved, the profitability of the applicable products, the relative benefit that accrues to actual and potential patients and other relevant factors. In no event shall 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' require a Party to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of profit or a negative return on investment.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces a contradiction in the definition of 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts.' The original definition outlines several factors to consider, including profitability, but also includes a requirement to undertake specific actions. The modified definition explicitly states that no action is required if it could lead to a loss, contradicting the implicit requirements in the original definition. This would cause uncertainty around scenarios when certain actions are necessary but not profitable.",

Without limiting the foregoing, Microgenics agrees to maintain a safety stock of rare reagents sufficient to meet each applicable Binding Forecast for the Assay. Microgenics shall provide Achaogen at least [***] ([***]) months (or [***]) prior written notice of any possible shortfall in meeting each applicable Binding Forecast or other commercial demand for the Assay, and the Parties shall promptly meet and discuss all reasonable commercial resolutions if Microgenics is unable to assure supply as needed to meet each applicable Binding Forecast pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 4.3.2.2.",

Microgenics shall provide Achaogen at least [***] ([***]) months (or [***]) prior written notice of any possible shortfall in meeting each applicable Binding Forecast or other commercial demand for the Assay, and the Parties shall promptly meet and discuss all reasonable commercial resolutions if Microgenics is unable to assure supply as needed.  Microgenics' obligation to supply is contingent upon the availability of necessary reagents and components from its suppliers.",
                "explanation": "The original text stated that Microgenics 'shall ensure' supply, which is a definite obligation. The new text states Microgenics 'shall use commercially reasonable efforts' to ensure the continued worldwide supply of the Assay, which is a more flexible obligation. The phrase 'obligation to supply is contingent' creates a contradiction as Microgenics can excuse performance.",

In the event that Microgenics reasonably believes that Achaogen has breached the foregoing covenant, Microgenics shall provide written notice thereof, including reasonable supporting evidence, and, in the event that Achaogen agrees with such written notice and does not indicate to Microgenics that it will conform its activities to the scope of the Transfer License within [***] ([***]) business days after receiving the written notice, then the Transfer License shall be void as of the end of [***] period described in this sentence. If Achaogen indicates that it will so conform its activities, then the Transfer License shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that Achaogen disagrees with such written notice and advises Microgenics of such disagreement, the Parties shall submit this matter to the Dispute resolution process in 13.8. For purposes of resolving any disputes regarding the Transfer License, the Parties agree to complete the Dispute resolution process in 13.8 within  [***] from the date of Microgenics' first written notice of the breach of the covenant found in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 9.4.4.1(i). If after concluding the Dispute resolution process in 13.8 it is determined that the covenant found in the proviso was breached, then the Transfer License shall terminate immediately.  In the event that the Transfer License is granted, Achaogen shall owe no payments to Microgenics for the first [***] ([***]) months that any Assay commercialized under the Transfer License is commercialized and shall pay a [***] percent ([***]%) royalty on its net sales (i.e., gross sales less all deductions, reductions and offsets reasonably taken in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) of Assays commercialized under the Transfer License following the end of such [***] ([***]) month period.",

                "explanation": "Original text specifies that if Achaogen breaches the covenant, the transfer license will be voided, whereas modified text states that 'even if Achaogen breaches the covenant...the transfer license will remain in effect' This creates an obvious internal contradiction.",

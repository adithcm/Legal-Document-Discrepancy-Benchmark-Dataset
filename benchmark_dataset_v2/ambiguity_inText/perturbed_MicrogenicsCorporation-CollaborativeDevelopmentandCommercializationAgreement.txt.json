                "changed_text": "1.7 \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts\" shall mean efforts and resources a Party deems appropriate, without requiring specific actions or levels of investment. The determination of such efforts shall be at the sole discretion of the Party, taking into account its overall business strategy. The factors listed in the original definition are merely guidelines and not binding requirements. In any event, 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts' shall not be construed to mandate any actions.",
                "explanation": "This introduces a contradiction. The original definition outlines specific considerations for 'Commercially Reasonable Efforts,' while the modified version grants sole discretion to the party, potentially negating any real obligation. This creates ambiguity about whether a party must genuinely try or can simply claim it deemed minimal effort sufficient.",

Any technical, scientific, or regulatory information, even if proprietary, shall not be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement.",
                "explanation": "Here, the scope of 'Confidential Information' is significantly narrowed. The original definition includes a broad range of information, while the modified version limits it to financially related information that is explicitly marked confidential. This creates conflict as some clauses (e.g., regarding technology transfer) rely on a broad definition of Confidential Information.",

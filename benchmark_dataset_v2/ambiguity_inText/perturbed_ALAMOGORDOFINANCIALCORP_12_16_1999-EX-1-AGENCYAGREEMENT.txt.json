Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank have retained the Agent to consult with and to advise the Bank, the MHC and the Company, and to assist the Company, on a best efforts basis, in the distribution of the shares of Common Stock in the Offering. The services that the Agent will provide include, but are not limited to (i) training the employees of the Bank who will perform certain ministerial functions in the Subscription and Community Offering regarding the mechanics and regulatory requirements of the stock offering process, (ii) managing the Stock Information Center by assisting interested stock subscribers and by keeping records of all stock orders and (iii) preparing marketing materials. 2 On the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company, the MHC and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter agreement (\"Letter Agreement\"), dated November 29, 1999 between the Company and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A). It is acknowledged by the Company, the MHC and the Bank that the Agent shall not be required to take or purchase any Shares or be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.",

                "explanation": "The change from 'best efforts basis' to 'strictly guaranteed basis' introduces a contradiction. The original text suggests the agent's efforts are not a strict obligation, whereas the modified text implies a binding guarantee to assist in the distribution of shares. This contradiction affects the interpretation of the Agent's liability.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'may, at their sole discretion' contradicts the previously stated agreement to pay or reimburse the agent. This introduces uncertainty regarding the payment of expenses. Similarly, 'are not required to reimburse the Agent' introduces a contradiction with the original text and an inconsistency with how the expenses are required to be reimbursed as stated in Section 2.",

                "explanation": "By adding 'may have' and 'may not have' to the representations and warranties regarding the Registration Statement's effectiveness and accuracy, the original firm commitment becomes ambiguous.

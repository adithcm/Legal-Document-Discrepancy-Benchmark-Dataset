                "explanation": "The original definition specifies lead time ending with required delivery, a clear obligation. The modified definition suggests ESTABLISHMENT only needs to estimate readiness, shifting responsibility and creating ambiguity.",

                "original_text": "5.4Acceptance, Rejection, and Claims. APOLLO may inspect any or all shipments of Product to insure all specifications are met including proper labeling, packaging and count within thirty (30) business days of APOLLO's receipt of each shipment; however, any such inspection shall not relieve ESTABLISHMENT of any obligations or warranties under this Agreement. APOLLO has the right to reject, via written notification to ESTABLISHMENT within this thirty (30) day period, any or all of a shipment of Product that fails to satisfy any warranty in this Agreement and may reject all of a given Lot of Product if a statistical sample does not meet the Specifications. Upon confirmation of defective condition by ESTABLISHMENT and issuance of a return material authorization (\"RMA\") number, APOLLO shall be entitled to the immediate return and replacement, free of charge, of any Product supplied by ESTABLISHMENT in breach of any warranty under this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "5.4Acceptance, Rejection, and Claims. APOLLO is encouraged to inspect shipments of Product at its earliest convenience. APOLLO will use reasonable efforts to notify Establishment within 120 days of receipt of any non conformities, but failure to notify Establishment does not constitute acceptance. APOLLO and Establishment will then cooperate in good faith to assess if the non conformities render the Products unsuitable. However, APOLLO must provide Establishment with an opportunity to fix the issue before return and replacement. APOLLO is entitled to a fair discount on the purchase price if the product is not return and replaced.",
                "explanation": "This change significantly alters the acceptance and rejection process. The original text gives APOLLO a clear 30-day window for rejection and immediate replacement. The modified version extends the potential notification period to 120 days, makes it non-obligatory. It adds a \"fix\" opportunity for Establishment before replacement, a fair discount instead of full refund.",

                "original_text": "7.3Records. Establishment shall keep complete, accurate and authentic accounts, notes, data and records pertaining to the manufacture, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of the Product, including without limitation master production and control records, in material compliance with applicable Regulatory Standards. Establishment shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and store such records in a manner to prevent loss, theft or deterioration. Establishment shall retain such records for five (5) years following the date of manufacture, or such longer period of time if consistent with Regulatory Standards, and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment shall contact Apollo and give Apollo the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo or destroyed. Unless this Agreement is terminated by Apollo due to a Triggering Event, in which case APOLLO shall bear the following costs: (i) ESTABLISHMENT may charge APOLLO for ESTABLISHMENT actual, documented, reasonable labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer or destruction of such documents and (ii) in the event of transfer of documents all freight costs shall be borne by APOLLO.",
                "changed_text": "7.3Records. Establishment shall keep accounts and records pertaining to the manufacture of the product. Establishment shall store such records as long as Establishment deems fit. Establishment shall make available to Apollo copies of the records that Establishment has kept at its discretion, taking into account resources and effort needed, after Apollo has paid fees. Upon the expiration of such period, Establishment shall give Apollo the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo. Apollo shall bear all costs for the transfer, including ESTABLISHMENT actual labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer of such documents, which will be mutually agreed.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a specific retention period (5 years or longer if required by regulations), requires the records be complete and in compliance. The modified text removes the definitiveness of the record retention period. It allows Establishment discretion, making compliance and access conditional on resources and payment, and changes the cost sharing in the event of a Triggering Event. Original agreement: ESTABLISHMENT costs and Apollo is only responsible for the costs if there is a Triggering Event. Modified version: Apollo is responsible for all costs.",

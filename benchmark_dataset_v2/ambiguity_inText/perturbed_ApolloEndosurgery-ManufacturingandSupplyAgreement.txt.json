                "changed_text": "1.7\"Lead Time\" shall mean the time period that begins on the day ESTABLISHMENT acknowledges a Purchase Order (defined below) for Product from APOLLO and ends on the day ESTABLISHMENT estimates to deliver the Product to APOLLO.",
                "explanation": "The original definition specifies a clear start and end point for the lead time, based on receipt of the purchase order and required delivery date. The modified definition changes the start to 'acknowledges' which is ambiguous as acknowledgment could be verbal or informal and the end to 'estimates to deliver' which creates uncertainty, as estimates are non-binding, undermining the definiteness required for supply chain management.",

                "original_text": "6.1Product Warranty. ESTABLISHMENT warrants that all Product supplied under this Agreement shall, when it leaves ESTABLISHMENT's possession and control, conform with the Specifications and shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship. ESTABLISHMENT further warrants that the Product shall be manufactured in accordance with applicable ISO 13485:2012 standards and with all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "changed_text": "6.1Product Warranty. ESTABLISHMENT warrants that all Product supplied under this Agreement shall, when it leaves ESTABLISHMENT's possession and control, substantially conform with the Specifications and shall be reasonably free from critical defects in materials and workmanship. ESTABLISHMENT further warrants that the Product shall be manufactured in general accordance with applicable ISO 13485:2012 standards and with all applicable laws and regulations.",
                "explanation": "The original warranty provides a strong assurance of conformity with specifications and freedom from defects. The altered version weakens the warranty by using 'substantially conform' and 'reasonably free from critical defects'. Furthermore, the change from 'in accordance' to 'in general accordance' reduces the commitment to strict adherence to standards and regulations, introducing ambiguity and lowering the manufacturer's responsibility for product quality.",

Establishment shall keep complete, accurate and authentic accounts, notes, data and records pertaining to the manufacture, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of the Product, including without limitation master production and control records, in material compliance with applicable Regulatory Standards. Establishment shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and store such records in a manner to prevent loss, theft or deterioration. Establishment shall retain such records for five (5) years following the date of manufacture, or such longer period of time if consistent with Regulatory Standards, and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment shall contact Apollo and give Apollo the option to have such quality control documentation transferred to Apollo or destroyed. Unless this Agreement is terminated by Apollo due to a Triggering Event, in which case APOLLO shall bear the following costs: (i) ESTABLISHMENT may charge APOLLO for ESTABLISHMENT actual, documented, reasonable labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer or destruction of such documents and (ii) in the event of transfer of documents all freight costs shall be borne by APOLLO.",
                "changed_text": "7.3Records. Establishment shall keep accounts, notes, data and records pertaining to the manufacture, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of the Product, including master production and control records, in compliance with most applicable Regulatory Standards. Establishment shall use reasonable efforts to maintain and store such records in a manner to prevent loss or deterioration. Establishment shall retain such records for five (5) years following the date of manufacture, or longer period of time if suggested by Regulatory Standards, and shall make available to Apollo copies of such records upon a formal request; and upon the expiration of such period, Establishment may transfer the documents to Apollo or destroy the documents. In both cases, APOLLO shall bear the costs: (i) ESTABLISHMENT may charge APOLLO for ESTABLISHMENT labor expenses incurred by ESTABLISHMENT for transfer or destruction of such documents and (ii) in the event of transfer of documents all freight costs shall be borne by APOLLO.",
                "explanation": "The change from 'complete, accurate and authentic accounts' to merely 'accounts' lowers the standard of record-keeping. The alteration from 'material compliance' to 'compliance with most applicable' reduces the level of regulatory adherence. Also, removing the term 'theft or deterioration' reduces the obligation for security. Moreover, the change from 'longer period of time if consistent' to 'suggested by' weakens the requirement, and finally replacing the 'option' with 'may' reduces the control that Apollo has over their documents.",

The Company shall pay the Base Fee in four (4) equal installments of nine thousand dollars ($9,000) each on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year during the Term commencing on January 15, 2000. The Professional acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to create or maintain the Products. The Professional agrees that payment of the Base Fee shall satisfy all obligations of the Company hereunder if it elects not to create or market and sell the Products.",

The Company shall pay the Base Fee in four (4) equal installments of nine thousand dollars ($9,000) each on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year during the Term commencing on January 15, 2000.

                "explanation": "The original Section 4.1 states the company *will* pay the professional a base fee. By adding the phrase 'contingent upon the successful launch and continued marketing of the Products', it creates a contradiction with the later statement 'The Professional agrees that payment of the Base Fee shall satisfy all obligations of the Company hereunder if it elects not to create or market and sell the Products.' It's now unclear if the base fee is guaranteed regardless of product launch or only if the product is launched and marketed.",

The Professional acknowledges that she will have a right, pursuant to and under the conditions described in Section 4.2 above, to receive a specified royalty for inventory on hand at the expiration of the initial term, and accordingly hereby grants to the Company the right to fill any orders for, assemble components of, market, advertise, promote and sell any inventory of Products in its inventory existing at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, for a period not to exceed two (2) years after such expiration or termination of the original term. To avoid any possibility of confusion of the public, trademark infringement or interference with the rights of the Company, the Professional agrees not to endorse, license or otherwise authorize the use of her name, likeness or image in connection with another company's golf clubs or golf-related clothing or equipment during the Term and for a period of two (2) years thereafter.",

",
                "explanation": "Section 9.1 prohibits the professional from endorsing competing products for two years after the term. However, adding the clause 'except for appearances at charity golf events' introduces a loophole. If the professional appears at a charity event sponsored by a competing golf club manufacturer, is that considered an endorsement? This creates uncertainty and a potential legal dispute.",

                "explanation": "The original clause states the Company is entitled to an injunction and all other remedies. The added text introduces a liquidated damages clause as the 'maximum fine.'

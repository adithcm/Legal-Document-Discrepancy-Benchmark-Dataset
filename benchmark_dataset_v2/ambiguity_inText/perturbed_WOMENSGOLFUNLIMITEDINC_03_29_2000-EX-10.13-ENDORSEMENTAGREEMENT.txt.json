                "original_text": "The Professional agrees to use only the golf clubs and golf bags of the Company in any golf event, whether professional or social, during the Term. The Professional agrees (i) to use no golf bag bearing any identification of a competitor of the Company and (ii) to wear no apparel bearing any identification of a competitor of the Company, and will prohibit any caddy of hers from bearing any such identification.",
                "changed_text": "The Professional agrees to use only the golf clubs of the Company in any professional golf event during the Term. The Professional agrees to use no golf bag bearing any blatant identification of a direct competitor of the Company and will encourage any caddy of hers to avoid displaying any such identification when reasonably practical.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity regarding the scope of the endorsement. Originally, the Professional was obligated to exclusively use the Company's products in both professional and social events. The revision limits the exclusivity to professional events and introduces vague qualifiers like 'blatant identification' and 'when reasonably practical,' creating uncertainty and potential loopholes in the endorsement agreement.",

The Company shall pay the Base Fee in four (4) equal installments of nine thousand dollars ($9,000) each on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year during the Term commencing on January 15, 2000. The Professional acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to create or maintain the Products. The Professional agrees that payment of the Base Fee shall satisfy all obligations of the Company hereunder if it elects not to create or market and sell the Products.",
                "changed_text": "The Company will pay the Professional a base fee of thirty-six thousand dollars ($36,000) per year (the \"Base Fee\") for Services performed during the Term, provided the Professional meets all obligations as determined by the Company. The Company shall pay the Base Fee in four (4) equal installments of nine thousand dollars ($9,000) each on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year during the Term commencing on January 15, 2000. The Professional acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to create or maintain the Products. The Professional agrees that payment of the Base Fee shall satisfy all obligations of the Company hereunder if it elects not to create or market and sell the Products, unless otherwise determined by the Company.",
                "explanation": "The introduction of 'provided the Professional meets all obligations as determined by the Company' and 'unless otherwise determined by the Company' creates a contradiction. The original clause guarantees the Base Fee payment if the Company doesn't create/market the products, but the revised clause introduces discretionary conditions that can negate this guarantee, causing uncertainty in compensation.",

However, this shall not preclude other endorsements if there is no blatant infringement, as determined by the Professional.",
                "explanation": "This change weakens the exclusivity clause. The original clause was a strict prohibition. The revised version introduces 'reasonable efforts' and allows the Professional to determine what constitutes a 'blatant infringement,' creating an ambiguous standard and potentially allowing conflicting endorsements.",

Dova shall be solely responsible for ensuring that the Product Materials prepared and approved by it are in compliance with the Regulatory Approval for the Product, the Product Labeling and Applicable Law. Once approved by Dova, the content of the Product Materials shall be provided by Dova to Valeant in advance of the Valeant Activates to allow for Valeant to review such content and provide verbal feedback to Dova in advance of use of the Product Materials. Within [***] of receipt of such Product Materials, Valeant shall verbally provide to Dova any comments and/or proposed revisions to such Product Materials, which comments and revisions Dova shall reasonably consider so long as Dova deems such suggestions are acceptable in the promotion of the Product; provided that in any event, to the extent that Dova reasonably believes that such changes are not in compliance with Applicable Law, the Regulatory Approval for the Product or the applicable Product Labeling, then Dova shall not be required to incorporate any such suggestions from Valeant in the Product Materials. In the event of any disagreement between the Parties regarding any feedback received from Valeant with respect to the Product Materials, Dova shall have the right to conclusively determine such matter. If Valeant has provided comments to Dova on the Product Materials and Dova accepts some or all of such comments, then, once revised, Dova shall provide to Valeant the revised versions of such Product Materials for further review by Valeant, in accordance with the terms and timelines of this Section 4.4.1(a) above.

The content of Product Materials shall not be modified or changed by Valeant or Field Force Personnel at any time without the prior written approval of Dova in each instance. Dova shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of creation and development of the Product Materials and Valeant shall be responsible for the costs and expense of reproduction, printing and delivery of the Product Materials to and for Valeant. The Parties will coordinate the production and delivery of Product Materials to allow sufficient internal and field force review time to accommodate scheduled training meetings and distribution to Field Force Personnel that are engaged in Detailing. In the event that Dova incurs costs and expenses for which Valeant is responsible under this Section 4.4.1, Dova may deduct such amounts from the payments due under Section 6.3 and shall include a description thereof in the applicable report under Section 6.3.

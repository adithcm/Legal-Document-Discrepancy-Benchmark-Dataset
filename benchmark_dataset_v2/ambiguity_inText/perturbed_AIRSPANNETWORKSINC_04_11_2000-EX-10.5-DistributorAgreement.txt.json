                "explanation": "The original text states the distributor is an 'exclusive distributor.' The changed text modifies this to 'non-exclusive distributor.' This creates a contradiction if the Schedule II or any other part of the agreement stipulates that the distribution rights are exclusive, or if later sections refer to the 'exclusive' nature of the distributorship, thus leading to uncertainty regarding the scope of the distribution rights.",

                "explanation": "The original text mandates that the Distributor 'agrees to provide' installation services and 'shall be performed' according to Airspan's standards, creating an obligation. The changed text alters 'agrees to provide' to 'may provide,' making the service optional. Furthermore, it changes 'shall be performed' to 'may be performed' in accordance with 'Distributor's own installation standards,' which gives it flexibility to deviate from Airspan's standards. If other parts of the agreement assume that installation services are mandatory and must meet Airspan's standards, this creates a contradiction and ambiguity.",

The changed version removes the warranty for the software altogether and reduces the warranty period for the Equipment to six months. This creates an ambiguity if the other sections of the contract refer to the Initial Warranty Period as twelve months for both Equipment and Software, particularly regarding support and maintenance responsibilities or extended warranty options.",

A Specification may be updated from time to time by PNC in its sole discretion, provided PNC provides Supplier with reasonable prior notice on any updates (\"Change Notification\"). Within [***] from receipt of the Change Notification, Supplier will either: (1) accept the Specification change at the current price and terms; or (2) submit to PNC a proposal (\"Proposal\") setting forth the conditions of acceptance that may include a change in price and/or other terms, including documentation to support same. Within [***] the Parties will discuss the Proposal in good faith and exercise their best efforts to agree on the appropriate adjustment if any. PNC will not issue any Purchase Orders, nor be required to issue any Purchase Orders to Supplier until PNC and Supplier have agreed on required Ingredient Specifications and any associated price and/or term adjustment. In the event the Parties fail to agree on required Ingredient Specifications or price and/or term adjustments despite their best good faith efforts, neither Party will have any further obligation with regard to purchase or supply of those Ingredients under any Master Purchase Commitments except that PNC shall take and pay for [***] of Ingredient inventory manufactured according to the then-current Specification.",

Within [***] the Parties will discuss the Proposal in good faith and exercise their best efforts to agree on the appropriate adjustment if any. PNC will issue Purchase Orders based on its internal estimations of the Specifications needed, even if the Supplier and PNC have not fully agreed on the required Ingredient Specifications or any associated price and/or term adjustment.

The modified text introduces 'substantially comply' which makes the enforcement uncertain, and allows PNC to issue POs even before specifications are agreed upon, conflicting with the original requirement.",

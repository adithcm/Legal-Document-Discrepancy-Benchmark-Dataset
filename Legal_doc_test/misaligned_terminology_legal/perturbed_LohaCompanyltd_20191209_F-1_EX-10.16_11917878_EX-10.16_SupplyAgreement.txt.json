                "original_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty which shall be deducted by the paying bank from the payment. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted as seven days. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract and the Sellers, in spite of the cancellation, shall still pay the aforesaid penalty to the Buyers without delay, the seller should refund the money received and pay the 30% of the total goods price of the penalty",
                "changed_text": "18. LATE DELIVERY AND PENALTY: Should the Sellers fail to make delivery on time as stipulated in the Contract, with exception of Force Majeure causes specified in Clause 17 of this Contract, the Buyers shall agree to postpone the delivery on condition that the Sellers agree to pay a penalty, which may be waived at the Buyer's discretion. The penalty, however, shall not exceed 5% of the total value of the goods involved in the late delivery. The rate of penalty is charged at 0.5% for every seven days, odd days less than seven days should be counted at the buyer's option. In case the Sellers fail to make delivery ten weeks later than the time of shipment stipulated in the Contract, the Buyers have the right to cancel the contract, but the penalty is not mandatory and depends on further negotiation.",
                "explanation": "The original text stipulates a fixed penalty for late delivery. The modified text introduces subjectivity by allowing the buyer to waive or negotiate the penalty, thus weakening the enforceability of the penalty clause. This creates uncertainty and potential disputes, deviating from standard contract law principles that require clear and definite terms, especially regarding remedies for breach of contract.",

                "law_explanation": "UCC Section 2-204 requires that a contract for the sale of goods have reasonably certain terms to provide a basis for determining a remedy in case of breach. By making the penalty waivable and subject to further negotiation, the modified clause introduces uncertainty and undermines the definiteness required by the UCC, making it difficult to enforce the penalty provision.",

                "changed_text": "10. INSURANCE: Insurance coverage is optional and at the discretion of the Seller. The level of coverage, if any, will be determined by the Seller.",
                "explanation": "The original contract mandates insurance coverage. The revised text makes insurance optional and delegates the decision about coverage to the seller. This contradicts the principle that the buyer should be protected in international sales as it transfers risk and responsibility unilaterally to the seller.",

                "law_explanation": "Article 6 of the CISG allows parties to derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions. However, making insurance optional undermines fundamental principles of risk allocation in international sales, which typically require clear provisions for insuring goods against loss or damage during transit. By making insurance optional, the modified text significantly shifts risk to the buyer without explicit agreement, potentially violating the implied obligations of good faith and fair dealing under the CISG and conflicting with normal trade practices.",

                "explanation": "The original clause specifies the governing law. The modified clause eliminates any reference to specific laws, stating the contract will be governed by 'principles of international commerce, as interpreted by the Seller'. This is problematic because it creates ambiguity and gives the Seller unilateral power to interpret the contract, potentially conflicting with established legal frameworks.",

                "law_explanation": "Section 187 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws addresses the law governing contractual issues, prioritizing the law chosen by the parties, provided there is a reasonable basis for their choice and it does not violate a fundamental policy of a state with a materially greater interest. The modified text, by removing any specific legal jurisdiction and granting the Seller unilateral interpretive power, creates a conflict. It disregards established conflict of laws principles that require a reasonable connection to a legal system and undermines the predictability and enforceability of the contract.",

                "explanation": "The original text affirms the filing in accordance with Rule 13d-1(k), which is mandatory under securities law. The modified text changes 'affirm' to 'suggest' and 'pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-1(k)' to 'pursuant to the general guidelines,' which weakens the obligation and contradicts the mandatory nature of the SEC rule.",

The modified text suggests the filing is discretionary and only follows 'general guidelines,' directly contradicting the mandatory obligation under Rule 13d-1(k).",

                "original_text": "All payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 45 days of receipt of an invoice from MD Anderson.",
                "changed_text": "All payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 90 days of receipt of an invoice from MD Anderson.",
                "explanation": "Changing the payment timeline to 90 days could violate prompt payment laws in some states. While Texas, where MD Anderson is located, does not have a general prompt payment law applicable to all contracts, extending payment terms significantly without justification could be deemed commercially unreasonable or conflict with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",
                "contradicted_law": "Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; Potential Breach of Contract",
                "law_citation": "Texas Business and Commerce Code, UCC ยง 1-304",

                "law_explanation": "Although Texas doesn't have a specific prompt payment law for private contracts of this nature, extending payment terms to 90 days without justification or mutual agreement may be considered a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in all contracts under Texas law. This duty requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of their contractual obligations. Unreasonably delaying payments can constitute a violation of this duty.",

                "changed_text": "The foregoing obligations will exist for a period of one (1) year from the date of completion of the last Study in relation to which the Confidential Information is disclosed or used.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be insufficient to protect trade secrets under Texas law, especially considering the advanced research involved. The Defend Trade Secrets Act and Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act require reasonable measures to protect confidentiality, and a one-year period may not be considered reasonable for highly valuable scientific data.",

                "law_explanation": "The TUTSA requires companies to take reasonable measures to protect their trade secrets. A one-year confidentiality period for sensitive research data, especially in a rapidly evolving field, may not be considered a 'reasonable measure' to maintain secrecy, particularly if the information has a longer commercial lifespan. This could jeopardize trade secret protection under Texas law.",

                "explanation": "Reducing the publication embargo period to one month or three months after study completion could conflict with academic standards and potentially violate intellectual property rights if Adaptimmune needs more time to file for patents or protect its inventions. Many universities have policies that require a reasonable embargo period to protect IP.",

                "law_explanation": "The Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to retain ownership of inventions made with federal funding but also requires them to protect and commercialize these inventions. Reducing the embargo period to one or three months may hinder Adaptimmune's ability to protect its intellectual property derived from the study results, potentially conflicting with the Bayh-Dole Act's objectives if the study receives any federal funding through MD Anderson. It could also violate MD Anderson's internal policies regarding the management of intellectual property.",

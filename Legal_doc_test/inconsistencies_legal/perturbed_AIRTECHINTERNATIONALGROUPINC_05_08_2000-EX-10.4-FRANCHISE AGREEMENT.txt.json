                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "You must find a suitable Center site within 90 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, unless we mutually agree otherwise. If we cannot agree on a Center location, within 4 months, we may a) extend your search time, b) exchange your territory, or c) terminate your Franchise and refund up to 70% of your Franchise Fee, at our sole discretion.",
                "changed_text": "You must find a suitable Center site within 30 days of signing the Franchise Agreement, and no extensions will be provided. If we cannot agree on a Center location within this 30-day period, we will immediately terminate your Franchise with no refund of your Franchise Fee.",
                "explanation": "The modified text shortens the period to find a suitable site from 90 days to 30 days and eliminates the possibility of extending search time. Additionally, it removes the refund option, which may not comply with franchise laws in some states.",
                "contradicted_law": "Franchise Disclosure Laws (e.g., California Franchise Investment Law)",
                "law_citation": "California Corporations Code Section 31100 et seq.",

                "law_explanation": "California and other states have franchise laws that may regulate the termination and refund policies. While this contract states it is interpreted under Texas law, the franchise may be sold in other states that have their own franchise laws. The 30-day site selection and the 'no refund' clause might be considered unreasonable or violate disclosure requirements or 'good cause' termination rules depending on the specific facts and the state.",

                "changed_text": "You shall give AIRSOPURE notice in writing of Your election to renew this Agreement at least 1 week prior to the expiration of the then-current term.",
                "explanation": "Reducing the notification period for renewal from 3 months to 1 week could be deemed unreasonable and contradict the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing present in most contracts.",

                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/good_faith",
                "law_explanation": "The implied covenant requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of contracts. A very short notice period (one week) for renewal places an undue burden on the franchisee and may not provide sufficient time to make an informed decision. This may violate the implied covenant of good faith, making the clause potentially unenforceable.",

            {
                "type": "Inconsistencies - Legal Contradiction",
                "original_text": "Upon Your death or mental incapacity, or a person owning all or controlling interest in Your Franchise, AIRSOPURE shall consent to the transfer of such interest to Your spouse or heirs provided, in AIRSOPURE's sole determination, such person(s) meet AIRSOPURE's then existing requirements and qualifications for the granting of an AIRSOPURE Franchise. If the said transfer shall not be approved by AIRSOPURE, Your executor, administrator or personal representative shall transfer Your interest to a third Party approved by AIRSOPURE within 6 months after Your death or the determination of Your mental incapacity. If Your interest is not disposed of within 6 months after such death or mental incapacity, AIRSOPURE may terminate this Agreement.",
                "changed_text": "Upon Your death or mental incapacity, AIRSOPURE has the sole right to terminate the agreement immediately, regardless of any heirs or interest holders.",
                "explanation": "Denying transfer to heirs due to death or mental incapacity contradicts inheritance laws and may be unenforceable. This is against general principles of estate law, where assets are generally inheritable unless there are very specific reasons to prevent it.",
                "contradicted_law": "Inheritance Laws/Probate Laws (Varies by State)",
                "law_citation": "Texas Estates Code, Section 451.001",
                "law_url": "https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/ES/htm/ES.451.htm",
                "law_explanation": "Texas Estates Code and similar laws in other states dictate how property is transferred upon death. While contractual provisions can govern specific aspects, a blanket denial of inheritance rights, especially without due process or consideration of the heirs' qualifications (which the original text does, to an extent), is likely unenforceable as against public policy promoting the orderly transfer of assets to legal heirs.",

                "original_text": "Subcontractor shall comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, Hazardous Communication Requirements, and all applicable environmental protection laws, rules, regulations and ordinances), ordinances, rules, regulations and lawful orders of any public authority having jurisdiction for the safety of persons or property or to protect them from damage, injury or loss.",

                "explanation": "The addition of 'endeavor to comply' and 'what it reasonably believes' introduces ambiguity and makes compliance discretionary. It allows the subcontractor to argue that they complied based on their own subjective interpretation of the law.",
                "contradicted_law": "Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)",
                "law_citation": "OSHA 29 CFR 1926.20(b)(1)",
                "law_url": "https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1926/1926.20",
                "law_explanation": "OSHA regulations require strict compliance with safety standards. By using the phrase 'endeavor to comply,' the modified text suggests that only a good-faith effort is necessary, rather than full adherence to the law, which is a violation. 29 CFR 1926.20(b)(1) states that 'It shall be the responsibility of the employer to initiate and maintain such programs as may be necessary to comply with this part.' which expects a high degree of commitment from the employer/subcontractor to comply with OSHA standards.",

                "changed_text": "Subcontractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain what it deems necessary licenses, permits or certificates (collectively \"Licenses\") required by any applicable law in connection with Subcontractor's performance of Work hereunder.",
                "explanation": "The phrases \"commercially reasonable efforts\" and \"what it deems necessary\" make the obligation to obtain necessary permits and licenses vague. It could be argued that if obtaining a permit proves difficult or expensive, the subcontractor has met their obligation by simply trying, even if they ultimately fail to secure the permit.",
                "contradicted_law": "Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 51. Professional Licensing and Regulation.",

                "law_explanation": "This section requires specific licensing for various professions to ensure competence and public safety. By allowing the subcontractor to determine what is 'necessary', it contradicts the state's legal requirement for mandatory licensing to perform certain types of work. The specific licensing requirements vary by occupation but failure to hold a license where required is a violation of the Texas Occupations Code.",

                "changed_text": "Subcontractor will attempt to pay for all services, equipment, material and labor used under this Agreement and will endeavor to keep EDGE' and Customer's property and work sites reasonably free of all claims or liens.",
                "explanation": "The terms 'attempt to pay' and 'endeavor to keep...reasonably free' weaken the obligation to pay for services/materials and keep the worksites free of liens. They suggest that the subcontractor is not absolutely responsible for preventing liens, introducing uncertainty.",

                "law_explanation": "Texas Property Code Chapter 53 provides legal mechanisms for contractors and suppliers to secure payment for work and materials provided in the improvement of real property. It protects subcontractors and suppliers by allowing them to file mechanic's liens against the property if they are not paid. The modification now allows for possible mechanic's liens, which is a violation of the original intent of the agreement.",

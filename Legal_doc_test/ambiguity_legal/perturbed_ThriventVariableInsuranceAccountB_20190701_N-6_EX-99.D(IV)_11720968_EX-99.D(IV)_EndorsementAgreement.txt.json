                "original_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be required to make an extra payment. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any extra payment. It will be based on each member's fair share of the deficiency. You may make the extra payment by an equivalent reduction in benefits or by a payment in cash. If you do not make the extra payment within 60 days from the date we notify you of your share of the deficiency, the amount will be charged as an indebtedness against the contract with interest compounded at the rate of 5% per year.",
                "changed_text": "If the solvency of the Society becomes impaired, you may be asked to consider an extra payment. The Board of Directors will, at their discretion, determine a potential amount for an extra payment. The determination will be vaguely based on a general estimation of each member's contribution to the financial status. You may consider a potential reduction in benefits or perhaps discuss a cash payment. Failure to consider a possible extra payment within a reasonable timeframe might lead to some form of action.",
                "explanation": "This change introduces ambiguity by making the extra payment discretionary ('asked to consider' instead of 'required'), the calculation vague ('vaguely based on a general estimation'), and the consequences of non-payment uncertain ('some form of action'). The original text established a clear obligation with defined consequences, while the modified text does not.",

                "law_explanation": "Wisconsin Statute 611.11 dictates that if a mutual insurance company (which Thrivent arguably falls under due to its historical structure and member benefits) faces impairment, assessments must be determined fairly and equitably to all members, based on their contributions. The modification's vague language about 'general estimation' and discretionary payments undermines this requirement for fairness and predictability, potentially violating this Wisconsin statute.",

                "original_text": "Each year, we will determine our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, will be credited as a dividend. Since we do not expect this contract to contribute to divisible surplus, it is not expected that any dividends will be credited.",
                "changed_text": "Each year, we may review our divisible surplus. This contract's share, if any, might be considered for a dividend. While it is currently not anticipated that this contract will contribute to divisible surplus, dividends could potentially be credited at our discretion.",
                "explanation": "The modification replaces definitive statements ('we will determine,' 'will be credited') with conditional and discretionary language ('may review,' 'might be considered,' 'could potentially be credited at our discretion'). This creates ambiguity about whether dividends will actually be assessed or paid, even if a surplus exists.",

                "law_explanation": "Wisconsin Statute 611.30(1)(a) mandates that mutual insurance companies must distribute divisible surplus equitably among its members. The change undermines that by suggesting that dividends are entirely discretionary, even when the contract may be entitled to a share of divisible surplus. This is misleading and could lead to unfair distribution of surpluses.",

Benefits will not be reduced or eliminated by any future amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.",

Benefits are not expected to be reduced or eliminated by amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, but some adjustments may occur.",
                "explanation": "By adding words like 'generally', 'most', 'potential', 'expected' and 'may', the changed text introduces uncertainty to what constitutes the entire contract, and to the protection from future changes. This is ambiguous and weakens the assurance that the stated terms are the final and binding agreement.",

                "law_explanation": "Wisconsin Statute 631.03(2) states that the policy, together with the application if any, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties. By weakening the definiteness of what constitutes the entire contract, the modified text introduces an ambiguity that may contradict this provision, making it difficult to determine exactly which documents are legally binding. Furthermore, saying 'some adjustments may occur' contradicts the protection of benefits provision, creating a discrepancy on which terms are legally protected.",

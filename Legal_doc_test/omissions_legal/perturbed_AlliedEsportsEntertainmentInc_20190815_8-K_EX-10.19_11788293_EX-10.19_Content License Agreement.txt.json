                "original_text": "All amounts payable and due will be made in U.S. dollars. If withholding taxes are required, Zynga may account for the required amount of such withholding taxes when calculating the Royalty or other payments payable prior to remittance to WPT. Zynga shall provide WPT with an official receipt or other equivalent documentation issued by the appropriate taxing authority or other evidence as is reasonably requested by WPT to establish that such taxes have been paid.",

                "explanation": "Removing the obligation for Zynga to provide WPT with official receipts or documentation for withholding taxes paid creates a legal contradiction. Without such documentation, WPT cannot verify the accuracy of the withholding and may face difficulties with its own tax filings. This introduces a legal risk for WPT, particularly in international transactions where tax regulations are complex.",

                "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts the general principles of tax law and reporting requirements. While not directly mandating the *payer* provide receipts to the *payee*, businesses are expected to keep accurate records and upon request, provide documentation to verify tax payments and withholdings to ensure correct tax declarations. By removing this, the agreement inhibits verification.",

                "changed_text": "Each party may carry liability insurance.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'agrees to carry' to 'may carry', the agreement no longer mandates liability insurance. This introduces a significant legal risk, especially given the nature of the agreement involving content licensing and promotional activities. Failure to maintain adequate liability insurance could expose either party to substantial financial losses in the event of a claim.",

                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/good_faith",
                "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which suggests parties should act reasonably to protect their own interests and the interests of the other party. Removing the mandatory insurance clause significantly increases risk for both parties and could be interpreted as a lack of good faith. Although no specific statute directly mandates insurance in all commercial contracts, omitting a reasonable risk mitigation measure like liability insurance contradicts the principle of acting in good faith.",

                "original_text": "In the event that either party is prevented from engaging in the marketing and promotional activities in Exhibit A manufacturing, distributing or selling the Licensed Property because of any act of God; unavoidable accident; fire, epidemic; strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; war, riot or civil commotion; act of public enemy; enactment of any rule, law, order or act of government or governmental instrumentality (whether federal, state, local or foreign); or other cause beyond such party's control, and such condition continues for a period of two (2) months or more, either party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective at any time during the continuation of such condition by giving the other party at least thirty (30) days' notice to such effect. In such event, all payments made shall become immediately due and payable and this Agreement shall be automatically terminated.",

In such event, this Agreement shall be automatically terminated.",
                "explanation": "Removing 'all payments made shall become immediately due and payable' contradicts common law principles regarding termination due to force majeure. Force majeure clauses are designed to excuse performance when unforeseen events make it impossible or impractical. Requiring all payments to become immediately due and payable upon termination due to a force majeure event creates an unreasonable and potentially unenforceable penalty on the party unable to perform due to circumstances beyond their control.",

                "law_url": "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/restitution",
                "law_explanation": "Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 272 addresses situations where a party's duty is discharged due to impracticability (often related to force majeure). It suggests that a party may be entitled to restitution for any benefit conferred on the other party. However, it does not generally support the idea that all payments become immediately due upon termination due to events outside a party's control; restitution is the standard, not accelerated payment of all future obligations.",

                "original_text": "Aimmune shall procure and maintain insurance, including clinical trials insurance and product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and which is consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which the Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold by Aimmune pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that any such clinical trials insurance coverage shall, prior to the First Commercial Sale of a Product, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence, and product liability insurance coverage shall, after such First Commercial Sale, in no event be less than [***] Dollars ($[***]) per loss occurrence. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written evidence of such insurance prior to commencement of this Agreement and upon expiration of any one coverage. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.",

It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune may provide Xencor with evidence of such insurance at its discretion. Aimmune may provide Xencor with written notice prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance.",
                "explanation": "The modified text removes the explicit requirements for minimum insurance coverage amounts, and the obligatory provision of written evidence of insurance to Xencor. Deleting the minimum requirements may lead to inadequate coverage, potentially violating legal requirements in countries like the US or EU. This change introduces legal risk by failing to ensure adequate financial protection against potential liabilities, a key consumer protection aspect.",

Specifically, the change fails to ensure that Aimmune maintains sufficient financial resources to meet potential compensation needs, contravening the intent behind these regulations.",

In connection with this Agreement, each Party represents, warrants and covenants to the other Party that it has complied and will comply with all Applicable Laws (including Anti-Corruption Laws) and industry codes dealing with government procurement, conflicts of interest, corruption or bribery, including, if applicable, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and any laws enacted to implement the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions.",

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.",

                "explanation": "The original clause offers 'prompt written notification' and also states an understanding that \"failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.3.1 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice.\" The changed clause removes these statements of 'prompt' and 'written' and also eliminates the provision that ensures the Indemnifying Party remains responsible to the level of material prejudice. Removing these key aspects significantly weakens the protection afforded to the indemnified party. This creates a legal risk by creating ambiguity around the notification process and the extent of the indemnifying party's obligation.",

                "law_explanation": "California law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract, requiring each party to act reasonably and honestly in performing its obligations. By removing the 'prompt written notification' and limiting the indemnifying party's obligations only to cases of material prejudice, the modification introduces potential for the indemnifying party to avoid its responsibilities by claiming lack of adequate or timely notice, or arguing there is no material prejudice. This action can be argued as a failure to act in good faith and deal fairly with the indemnified party, creating a legal contradiction with California's established contract law.",

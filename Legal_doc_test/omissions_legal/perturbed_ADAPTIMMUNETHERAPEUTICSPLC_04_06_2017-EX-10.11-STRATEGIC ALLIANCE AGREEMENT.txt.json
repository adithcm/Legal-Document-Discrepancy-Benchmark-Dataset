                "original_text": "2.8 MD Anderson and Adaptimmune shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertaining to confidentiality, consent and disclosure of all information or records obtained and reviewed in the course of the Study, and shall permit access to such information or records only as authorized by a relevant Study subject, the IRB, and as authorized by law. Each Party agrees to comply with all provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") regulations (45 C.F.R.",

Each Party agrees to comply with provisions of state laws regarding patient information.",
                "explanation": "The omission of 'consent' and the specific reference to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) weakens the protection of patient data. The removal of direct HIPAA compliance is a legal risk since clinical studies in the US must adhere to it when handling patient health information. Replacing HIPAA with a general reference to state laws reduces the obligation.",

                "law_explanation": "HIPAA mandates specific requirements for the use and disclosure of protected health information. By removing the explicit reference to HIPAA compliance, the modified text introduces ambiguity regarding the required level of protection for patient data, making it potentially non-compliant.",

                "original_text": "10.1 Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility for reasonable medical expenses incurred by a Study subject for reasonable and necessary treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol that the subject would not have undergone were it not for such Study subject's participation in the Study. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving relevant documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.",
                "changed_text": "10.1 Adaptimmune may consider assuming responsibility for medical expenses incurred by a Study subject for treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol. Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions or underlying disease. Any payments for medical expenses are subject to Adaptimmune receiving documentation supporting the claim.",
                "explanation": "By changing 'shall assume responsibility' to 'may consider assuming responsibility,' the contract weakens Adaptimmune's obligation to cover medical expenses for subjects injured during the study. Removing 'reasonable and necessary treatment', 'adverse event', 'negligence or intentional misconduct', and the protocol clause allows Adaptimmune to potentially deny coverage in cases where it would otherwise be required. This violates basic protections for research participants.",

                "law_explanation": "21 CFR Part 50 outlines requirements for informed consent and protection of human subjects in clinical trials. By weakening the financial responsibility for medical expenses resulting from the study, it introduces a situation where subjects may not receive appropriate care, potentially violating the ethical standards required by this regulation.",

This creates a legal risk by potentially exposing MD Anderson to liability if the drug is not manufactured according to standards or if it infringes on another party's rights.

By removing the warranty that the drug is manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices, the contract weakens the assurance that the drug is not adulterated, thereby potentially exposing study participants and MD Anderson to legal and health risks associated with using a non-compliant drug.",

(ii) If Vendor becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability or refusal to pay, debts as they become due, then AT&T shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate AT&T’s obligations under this Agreement or the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable, and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum. (iii) If (1) Vendor (A) receives a notice of default (or similar breach or violation) and has not cured such default (or similar breach or violation) within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice or (B) is in default under any credit facility or other financing arrangement, (2) any Vendor credit facility or other financing arrangement has been terminated or suspended (other than by Vendor or as a result of an expiration in accordance with its terms) or (3) Vendor no longer has access to funding under any credit facility or other financing arrangement required by Vendor to fulfill its obligations to AT&T under this Agreement, the Master License Agreement, the Transport Agreement and the Roaming Agreement (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum), then Vendor shall promptly, but no later than one (1) business day following Vendor’s receipt of notice of any such event, notify AT&T of such event and in addition to all other rights and remedies at law or in equity or otherwise, AT&T shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate AT&T’s obligations under this Agreement or the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable, and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum; provided, that prior to exercising such termination right, AT&T shall enter into good faith discussions with Vendor to determine if Vendor can obtain alternative financing.

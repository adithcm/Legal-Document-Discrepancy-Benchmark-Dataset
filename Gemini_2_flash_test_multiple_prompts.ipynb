If you flip one and it lands on heads, you instantly know the other one will land on tails, even if they are miles apart. This is kind of like entanglement.  When qubits are entangled, knowing the state of one instantly tells you something about the state of the other, even if they're separated.  This allows quantum computers to perform incredibly complex calculations in a coordinated way.\n",

      "*   **Drug discovery:** Simulating molecules to design better drugs.\n",
      "*   **Materials science:**  Creating new and improved materials.\n",
      "*   **Cryptography:**  Breaking codes and developing new, unbreakable codes.\n",
      "*   **Financial modeling:**  Analyzing financial data and predicting market trends.\n",

    "    prompt_ambiguity_legal = f\"\"\"You are a senior compliance officer reviewing a legal contract. Your task is to modify a section of the contract by introducing an ambiguous legal obligation while ensuring that the ambiguity contradicts a state or national law.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what state or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Ambiguities occur when a legal statement is vague, leading to multiple interpretations. A **legal contradiction** under this category happens when an obligation is introduced ambiguously, making it difficult to enforce under state or national law. This can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, leaving legal obligations open to dispute.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a clear legal obligation in the contract.\n",
    "    2. Modify the wording to make it **vague or open to multiple interpretations**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure that this ambiguity creates **non-compliance with a specific law** in the identified jurisdiction.\n",

    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall provide accommodations for disabled employees as deemed appropriate.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The term \"as deemed appropriate\" introduces ambiguity, conflicting with **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**, which mandates **clear, non-discretionary accommodations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All contractors must comply with local zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"All contractors must make reasonable efforts to comply with zoning laws.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Reasonable efforts\" is vague—some zoning laws require strict adherence.\n",

    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The landlord shall ensure habitable living conditions in compliance with state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The landlord shall make efforts to maintain habitable conditions.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Make efforts\" does not guarantee habitability, which violates **tenant protection laws**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that meet industry standards.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The company shall maintain data security measures that it deems sufficient.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Deems sufficient\" is subjective and contradicts **GDPR and CCPA** requirements for **specific security standards**.\n",

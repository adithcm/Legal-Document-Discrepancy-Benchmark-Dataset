      "Okay, imagine a light switch. A normal computer bit is like that light switch: it can be either ON (1) or OFF (0).\n",

      "Quantum computing is like a dimmer switch with a HUGE range of positions. It can be ON, OFF, or somewhere *in between* at the same time.  This \"somewhere in between\" state is thanks to two quantum mechanics principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Superposition:** A quantum bit (called a \"qubit\") can be both 0 and 1 *simultaneously*. Think of it as the dimmer switch being at multiple brightness levels all at once.  It's like a coin spinning in the air - it's neither heads nor tails until it lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Entanglement:** If you have two qubits that are entangled, they are linked together in a spooky way.  If you measure the state of one qubit, you instantly know the state of the other, even if they are far apart.  Think of it like two coins that always land on opposite sides. If you see one is heads, you know the other is tails, no matter how far apart they are.\n",

      "**So, in a nutshell:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers use the weirdness of quantum mechanics (superposition and entanglement) to perform calculations in a fundamentally different way than regular computers. This allows them to potentially solve certain types of problems much faster.\n",

      "**However, it's important to note:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development.\n",
      "*   They won't replace regular computers entirely. They are better suited for specific types of problems.\n",
      "*   These problems typically involve complex simulations, optimization, and cryptography.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here are some applications they might be good for:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug discovery:** Simulating molecules to find new medicines.\n",
      "*   **Materials science:** Designing new and better materials.\n",
      "*   **Financial modeling:** Predicting market trends.\n",
      "*   **Cryptography:** Breaking and creating more secure codes.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing complex systems:** Such as traffic flow, logistics, and supply chains.\n",

    "    Omissions occur when a contract **removes essential information**, creating legal loopholes. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract omits **a legally mandated consumer protection**, making it non-compliant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a clause that **grants consumers a legally required right**.\n",
    "    2. **Remove or modify** it so that the contract becomes **non-compliant with a law**.\n",
    "    3. Ensure that the omission introduces **legal risk** in the identified jurisdiction.\n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Omitting Consumer Rights:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Customers have the right to return the product within 30 days, as required by state law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Customers have the right to return the product at the company’s discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Many states (e.g., California) require **minimum return periods**—removing this makes the contract non-compliant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The landlord shall provide a habitable living environment as required by law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The landlord shall make reasonable efforts to provide a habitable living environment.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \"Reasonable efforts\" **weakens tenant rights**, violating **housing laws**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Bank deposits are insured up to $250,000 under federal law.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Bank deposits may be insured based on company policy.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Federal law **mandates insurance coverage**—removing this statement misleads consumers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees are entitled to paid overtime after 40 hours per week.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Overtime compensation shall be determined at the company's discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** **Federal labor laws** require **clear overtime pay guidelines**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"All loan agreements must provide an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) disclosure.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Loan agreements may include an APR disclosure.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some laws **mandate APR transparency**—removing this makes loans non-compliant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The tenant shall maintain comprehensive liability insurance covering all damages arising from negligence or misconduct on the premises, with a minimum coverage amount of $2 million per occurrence. The tenant shall provide proof of insurance annually to the landlord. Failure to maintain coverage at this level shall constitute grounds for lease termination.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The tenant shall maintain liability insurance covering damages arising from negligence or misconduct on the premises. Proof of insurance may be requested by the landlord as necessary.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The removal of 'comprehensive' and the 'minimum coverage amount of $2 million per occurrence' significantly weakens the insurance requirement. The deletion of the **annual proof requirement** eliminates an important compliance measure. This creates a **legal contradiction** with state laws that mandate specific minimum coverage amounts for commercial leases.\n",

      "Warning: Could not find section in text: During the term of this Agreement, you shall maintain in force under policies of insurance issued by licensed insurers approved by us insurance coverage as we from time to time require. You must maintain insurance related to your operation of the Franchised Business. Such insurance coverage will include: 5.5.1 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: broad form comprehensive general liability coverage against claims for employment practices coverage, bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the conduct of business by you pursuant to this Agreement and broad form contractual liability coverage, including errors and omissions coverage, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage prescribed by us from time to time, but in no event in an amount less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) aggregate. Such insurance shall not have a deductible or self-insured retention in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000); 5.5.2 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: automobile liability insurance coverage, including owned and non-owned vehicles, with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence; 5.5.3 As it relates to the operation of your Franchised Business: worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance in statutory amounts, unemployment insurance and state disability insurance as required by governing law for your employees; You shall also maintain such additional insurance as is necessary to comply with all legal requirements concerning insurance. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under such insurance policies and require different or additional kinds of insurance at any time including excess liability insurance to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances. The insurance policies required herein shall: (a) name us as an additional named insured and contain a waiver of all subrogation rights against us, our affiliates, and our and their successors and assigns; (b) provide for thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us of any material modification, cancellation, or expiration of such policy; (c) provide that the coverage applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is brought as though a separate policy had been issued to each insured; (d) contain no provision which in any way limits or reduces coverage for you in the event of a claim by any one or more of the parties indemnified under this Agreement; (e) be primary to and without right of contribution from any other insurance purchased by the parties indemnified under this Agreement; and (f) extend to and provide indemnity for all obligations assumed by you hereunder and all other items for which you are required to indemnify us under this Agreement. You shall provide us with evidence of the insurance required hereunder not later than ten (10) days before you begin operating as a Master Franchisee, and with a complete copy of each insurance policy no more than thirty (30) days after delivery of the original proof of insurance. Thereafter, prior to the expiration of the term of each insurance policy, you shall furnish us with a copy of each renewal or replacement insurance policy to be maintained by you for the immediately following term and evidence of the payment of the premium therefor. Should you, for any reason, fail to procure or maintain the insurance required by this Agreement, as such requirements may be revised from time to time by us in writing, we shall have the right and authority (without, however, any obligation to do so) immediately to procure such insurance and to charge same to you, which charges shall be payable by you immediately upon notice together with a ten percent (10%) administrative fee. The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity. The maintenance of sufficient insurance coverage shall be your responsibility. Your obligations to maintain insurance coverage as herein described shall not be affected in any manner by reason of any separate insurance maintained by us nor shall the maintenance of such insurance relieve you of any indemnification obligations under this Agreement.\n",

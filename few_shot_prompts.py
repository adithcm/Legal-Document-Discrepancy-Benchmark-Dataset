Section 1.1: Adaptimmune shall have responsibility for IND filing and monitoring unless otherwise agreed by JSC.
Section 2.9: MD Anderson and Adaptimmune will promptly notify each other upon identifying any aspect of a Protocol, including information discovered during site monitoring visits, or Study results that may adversely affect the safety, well-being, or medical care of the Study subjects, or that may affect the willingness of Study subjects to continue participation in a Study, influence the conduct of the Study, or that may alter the IRB's approval to continue the Study.
Section 8.3: The Parties agree that any termination of a Study Order shall allow for: (i) the wind down of the Study to ensure the safety of Study subjects; and (ii) Adaptimmune's final reconciliation of Data related to the Study in addition to Adaptimmune's final monitoring visit.

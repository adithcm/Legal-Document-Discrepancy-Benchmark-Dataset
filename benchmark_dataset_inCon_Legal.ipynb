      "Imagine a regular computer bit as a light switch: it can be either ON (1) or OFF (0).  It's either/or.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now imagine a magic light switch that can be BOTH ON AND OFF AT THE SAME TIME. That's the basic idea behind a **qubit**, which is the fundamental building block of a quantum computer.\n",

      "Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regular Computers (Classical Computers):**  Store information as bits, which are either 0 or 1.  They do one thing at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Quantum Computers:** Store information as **qubits**.  Qubits can be 0, 1, OR a combination of both *at the same time*.  This \"both at the same time\" state is called **superposition**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is superposition powerful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because a qubit can represent multiple possibilities simultaneously, a quantum computer can explore many potential solutions to a problem at the same time.  Think of it like exploring a maze. A regular computer has to try each path one by one. A quantum computer, thanks to superposition, can explore all paths at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Another important concept is Entanglement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine two of our magic light switches (qubits) that are linked together in a special way.  If you flip one, you instantly know the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.  This is called **entanglement**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is entanglement useful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Entanglement allows qubits to work together and perform complex calculations much faster than regular computers.  It's like having a team of explorers all working on different parts of the maze at the same time and instantly sharing information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, what can quantum computers do?**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Solve Complex Problems:** Quantum computers excel at problems that are too difficult for even the most powerful regular computers, such as:\n",
      "    * **Drug discovery and materials science:**  Simulating molecules to design new drugs and materials.\n",
      "    * **Optimization problems:**  Finding the best solutions for complex logistical challenges, like routing trucks or optimizing financial portfolios.\n",
      "    * **Cryptography:**  Potentially breaking existing encryption algorithms and creating new, more secure ones.\n",
      "    * **Artificial Intelligence:**  Training machine learning models more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development. They are not going to replace your laptop anytime soon. They are specialized tools for specific types of problems.  They are also very sensitive to noise and interference, making them difficult to build and maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum computers use qubits that can be both 0 and 1 at the same time (superposition) and can be linked together in a special way (entanglement). This allows them to explore many possibilities simultaneously and solve complex problems much faster than regular computers.  While still in their infancy, quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize many fields.\n",

    "def generate_perturbation_new(original_text, file_name, prompt):    \n",
    "    \"\"\"Generates a perturbed version of the legal document section in structured JSON format.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"You are an employment law specialist ensuring that contractual deadlines comply with legal regulations. Your task is to modify a timeline in the contract so that it contradicts state or federal laws.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before modifying the text:\n",
    "    - **Read the file** to determine what city, state, or country the contract applies to.\n",
    "    - If the jurisdiction is unclear, default to **United States law**.\n",
    "    - Make sure that when taking the original texts, there should be no jumps between sentences. Take the start to end of the original section without skipping sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Definition:**\n",
    "    Inconsistencies arise when **time-sensitive obligations** in a contract do not align with legal requirements. A **legal contradiction** in this category happens when a contract sets **a deadline or requirement that violates federal or state law**, making the contractual terms unenforceable or illegal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
    "    1. Identify a contractual deadline that is **regulated by law** (e.g., payment terms, claims deadlines, notice periods).  \n",
    "    2. Modify the deadline to **conflict with state or federal legal requirements**.  \n",
    "    3. Ensure that the change **creates non-compliance with regulatory standards**.  \n",
    "    4. For that perturbation, make sure in the file there should be **2-3** of them. \n",
    "    5. Output the modified contract in structured JSON format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### **Examples of Conflicts with Regulatory Timelines:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 1:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Employees must submit harassment claims within 15 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Employees must submit harassment claims within 5 days.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some states (e.g., California) require **at least 30 days** for harassment claims.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 2:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Landlords must return security deposits within 21 days of lease termination.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Landlords must return security deposits within 60 days of lease termination.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Many states **mandate 14-30 days** for deposit refunds.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 3:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Customers have the right to cancel a contract within 10 days of signing.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Customers may cancel contracts within 48 hours.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some **consumer protection laws** require **at least 7-10 days** for contract cancellations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 4:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Workers must receive final wages within 72 hours of termination.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Workers will receive final wages at the company's discretion.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Federal and state laws **require clear final paycheck deadlines**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 5:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"Loan repayment plans must allow at least 90 days for late payments before default.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"Loan repayment plans may declare default after 30 days of non-payment.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** Some **loan regulations require longer grace periods**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example 6:**\n",
    "    - **Original:** \"The term 'Confidential Information' shall refer to any proprietary business, financial, and technical data disclosed by one party to the other, including but not limited to customer lists, pricing strategies, trade secrets, and non-public financial records. Confidential Information shall be protected for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure.\"\n",
    "    - **Modified:** \"The term 'Confidential Information' shall refer to sensitive business information disclosed by one party to the other. Each party shall determine what constitutes Confidential Information based on its internal policies. Confidentiality obligations shall remain in effect for a commercially reasonable period.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** The modified text **weakens the definition** of **\"Confidential Information\"** by removing specific protected categories (e.g., customer lists, trade secrets). Additionally, allowing **each party to define confidentiality based on \"internal policies\"** introduces **uncertainty and contradictions** with other parts of the agreement. The term **\"commercially reasonable period\"** replaces the **clear five-year obligation**, which conflicts with standard contract law principles that require clearly defined confidentiality periods.\n",

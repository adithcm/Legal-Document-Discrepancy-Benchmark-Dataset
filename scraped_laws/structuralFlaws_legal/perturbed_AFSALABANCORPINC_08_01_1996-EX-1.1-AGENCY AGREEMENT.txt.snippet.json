        "original_text": "All subscription funds received by Capital Resources (and if by check shall be made payable to the Company) or by other NASD registered broker-dealers soliciting subscriptions (if any) shall be transmitted (either by U.S. Mail or similar type of transmittal) to the Company by noon of the following business day.",
        "changed_text": "All subscription funds received by Capital Resources (and if by check shall be made payable to the Company) or by other NASD registered broker-dealers soliciting subscriptions (if any) shall be transmitted (either by U.S. Mail or similar type of transmittal) to the Company within thirty business days.",
        "explanation": "The change extends the transmission deadline of subscription funds, potentially conflicting with regulations requiring prompt transfer of funds. The original text states \"by noon of the following business day,\" implying an obligation for immediate transfer. This modification extends the deadline to thirty business days, introducing a contradiction.",

        "law_explanation": "SEC Rule 15c2-4 requires brokers or dealers to promptly transmit customer funds received in connection with an offering. The modified text, which allows for a 30-day delay, clearly contradicts the requirement for prompt transmission under this rule.",

It shall constitute a “fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act or practice” as used in section 15(c)(2) of the Act, for any broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer participating in any distribution of securities, other than a firm-commitment underwriting , to accept any part of the sale price of any security being distributed unless: (a) The money or other consideration received is promptly transmitted to the persons entitled thereto; or (b) If the distribution is being made on an “all-or-none” basis, or on any other basis which contemplates that payment is not to be made to the person on whose behalf the distribution is being made until some further event or contingency occurs, (1) the money or other consideration received is promptly deposited in a separate bank account, as agent or trustee for the persons who have the beneficial interests therein, until the appropriate event or contingency has occurred, and then the funds are promptly transmitted or returned to the persons entitled thereto, or (2) all such funds are promptly transmitted to a bank which has agreed in writing to hold all such funds in escrow for the persons who have the beneficial interests therein and to transmit or return such funds directly to the persons entitled thereto when the appropriate event or contingency has occurred.

        "explanation": "By changing the jurisdiction, the parties may inadvertently violate state and federal laws that apply to the contract.

        "law_explanation": "Courts generally honor the choice of law provisions in contracts if the chosen state has a reasonable relationship to the parties or the transaction. Choosing a jurisdiction with no connection to the parties or transaction (a fictional location) may render the choice of law provision unenforceable, leading a court to apply the law of a jurisdiction with a closer connection, potentially contradicting the intent of the parties and applicable regulations.",

        "explanation": "The modified text weakens the indemnification clause by changing 'shall indemnify' to 'shall endeavor to indemnify,' making the obligation less definite. It also removes 'all' before 'damages, costs, and expenses' and removes 'reasonable attorney's fees and court costs' making the extent of indemnification unclear. Removing 'negligence or intentional misconduct' limits the scope of indemnity.",

        "law_explanation": "Texas law requires that indemnity agreements related to negligence or intentional misconduct be explicitly stated and clearly defined. By weakening the 'shall indemnify' obligation and removing detailed cost descriptions, the modified text creates ambiguity and could be interpreted as unenforceable under Texas law, particularly if COMPANY argues that its 'endeavor' was sufficient, even if full indemnification was not achieved. Also, by changing the definition of what is covered by the indemnity agreement, the contract could be interpreted to violate the anti-indemnity statute. Under the statute, a company generally cannot contract to indemnify a party if that party is negligent.",

If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer. (b) Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller's obligations with reference to them are subject to this chapter, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith.

(a) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if (1) nothing is said as to price; or (2) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or (3) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded. (b) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith. (c) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price. (d) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.

(b) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.

The provided Texas law snippet, specifically Sec. 2.306(b), discusses 'best efforts' in the context of exclusive dealings.

Sec. 134A.002. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter: (1) \"Claimant\" means a party seeking to recover damages under this chapter, including a plaintiff, counterclaimant, cross-claimant, or third-party plaintiff. In an action in which a party seeks recovery of damages under this chapter on behalf of another person, \"claimant\" includes both that other person and the party seeking recovery of damages.

(2) \"Improper means\" includes theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, to limit use, or to prohibit discovery of a trade secret, or espionage through electronic or other means. (3) \"Misappropriation\" means: (A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (B) disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: (i) used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; (ii) at the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that the person's knowledge of the trade secret was: (a) derived from or through a person who used improper means to acquire the trade secret; (b) acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (c) derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain the secrecy of or limit the use of the trade secret; or (iii) before a material change of the position of the person, knew or had reason to know that the trade secret was a trade secret and that knowledge of the trade secret had been acquired by accident or mistake. (3-a) \"Owner\" means, with respect to a trade secret, the person or entity in whom or in which rightful, legal, or equitable title to, or the right to enforce rights in, the trade secret is reposed. (4) \"Proper means\" means discovery by independent development, reverse engineering unless prohibited, or any other means that is not improper means.

(7) \"Willful and malicious misappropriation\" means intentional misappropriation resulting from the conscious disregard of the rights of the owner of the trade secret.

The change from a fixed term to 'reasonable period,' 'shall' to 'should,' and removal of specific actions weakens the obligation. The law snippet defines 'trade secret' as requiring 'reasonable measures' to keep information secret, supporting the LLM's reasoning that the modified text could make it difficult to prove reasonable measures were taken. The TUTSA is real and relevant."

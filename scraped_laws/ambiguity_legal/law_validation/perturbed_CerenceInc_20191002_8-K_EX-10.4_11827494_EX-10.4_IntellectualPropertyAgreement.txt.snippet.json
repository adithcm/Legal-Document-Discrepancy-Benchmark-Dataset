        "justification": "The original contract text states that the assignee \"shall have the sole responsibility\" to file IP assignment agreements, creating a clear and direct obligation. The changed text weakens this obligation by stating the assignee \"shall endeavor to file\" and introduces conditions like \"as deemed reasonably necessary\" and \"if practical.\" While the scraped law snippet only provides a table referencing 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 1060, and not the actual text of the law, the Law Explanation states that this law requires assignments of trademarks to be recorded with the USPTO. The changes to the contract language introduce ambiguity and weaken the original, stronger obligation, potentially leading to non-compliance with 15 U.S. Code \u00a7 1060, if the 'endeavor' is not fulfilled, and making enforcement of the obligation difficult. Therefore, there is a significant contradiction created by the weakening of the obligation to file the required documents."

        "justification": "The original contract mandates that each party 'shall comply' with all applicable national and international import/export laws. The changed text weakens this obligation by stating that parties 'agree to make commercially reasonable efforts to comply'. This introduces a subjective standard, potentially allowing a party to avoid compliance if they deem it commercially unreasonable. The LLM's law explanation indicates that the EAR mandates strict compliance, and lack of awareness is not an excuse. While the scraped law snippet doesn't explicitly state 'strict compliance', the overall tone and the extensive list of resources for compliance suggest a high level of expected adherence to export regulations. The shift from 'shall comply' to 'commercially reasonable efforts' creates a significant contradiction because it allows for non-compliance under certain circumstances, which goes against the intent and enforcement mechanisms implied in the provided resources concerning export control."

General Corporation Law Subchapter IV. Directors and Officers \u00c2\u00a7 141. Board of directors; powers; number, qualifications, terms and quorum; committees; classes of directors; nonstock corporations; reliance upon books; action without meeting; removal. (a) The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation. If any such provision is made in the certificate of incorporation, the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon the board of directors by this chapter shall be exercised or performed to such extent and by such person or persons as shall be provided in the certificate of incorporation. (b) The board of directors of a corporation shall consist of 1 or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. The number of directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws, unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, in which case a change in the number of directors shall be made only by amendment of the certificate. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws. The certificate of incorporation or bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. Each director shall hold office until such director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successor is elected and qualified or until such director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier resignation or removal. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. A majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business unless the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws require a greater number. Unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, the bylaws may provide that a number less than a majority shall constitute a quorum which in no case shall be less than \u00e2 \u0093 of the total number of directors. The vote of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors unless the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws shall require a vote of a greater number. (c) (1) All corporations incorporated prior to July 1, 1996, shall be governed by this paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that any such corporation may by a resolution adopted by a majority of the whole board elect to be governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in which case this paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to such corporation. All corporations incorporated on or after July 1, 1996, shall be governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate 1 or more committees, each committee to consist of 1 or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate 1 or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. The bylaws may provide that in the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not the member or members present constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

        "justification": "The original contract text mandates the parties \"shall use reasonable best efforts\" to complete the transactions. The changed text weakens this obligation to \"will consider using reasonable efforts, where practical\" and \"potentially consummate.\" The LLM's law explanation references DGCL Section 141(a), stating that the business and affairs of a corporation be managed 'by or under the direction of a board of directors', implying a level of due diligence. The scraped law snippet confirms this, stating \"the business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors...\" While Section 141(a) doesn't explicitly define 'reasonable best efforts' or prohibit considering options, the weakening of the obligation from a mandatory effort to a discretionary consideration, combined with the less definitive language regarding consummation, could be argued as a failure to properly manage the corporation's affairs. The strength of this argument depends on the specific context and whether the board's actions, even under the changed text, still demonstrate sufficient due diligence under Section 141(a). Therefore, the contradiction is moderate, not direct, due to the lack of specific definitions within the statute."

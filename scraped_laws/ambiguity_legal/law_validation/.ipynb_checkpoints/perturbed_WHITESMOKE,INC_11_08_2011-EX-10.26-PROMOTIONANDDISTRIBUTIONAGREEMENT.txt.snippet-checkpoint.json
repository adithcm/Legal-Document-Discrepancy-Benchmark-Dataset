Beginning on the Launch Date and continuing throughout the Term, Distributor shall ensure that [ * ]Distributor App distributed by or on behalf of Distributor is bundled with the Distribution Products as set out in this Agreement.",

Beginning on the Launch Date and continuing throughout the Term, Distributor should aim to ensure that a significant portion of Distributor Apps distributed by or on behalf of Distributor is bundled with the Distribution Products as set out in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "This modification introduces ambiguity by replacing 'shall begin distribution' with 'shall endeavor to begin distribution within a reasonable timeframe,' making the obligation to start distribution less definitive. 'Reasonable timeframe' is subjective and lacks a clear deadline. Furthermore, changing 'shall ensure that' to 'should aim to ensure that a significant portion' weakens the commitment to bundling, introducing further uncertainty about the extent of compliance. This creates a vague legal obligation.",

        "law_explanation": "By replacing 'shall' with weaker, subjective terms like 'endeavor' and 'reasonable timeframe,' the contract creates ambiguity that makes it difficult to prove a breach of contract due to failure to perform a specific action within a defined timeframe. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 235 states that when performance of a duty under a contract is due any non-performance is a breach. The modified language makes it harder to enforce a specific performance date.",

        "scraped_snippet": "contract | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute Please help us improve our site! \u00d7 No thank you contract A contract is an agreement between parties , creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law . The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent , expressed by a valid offer and acceptance ; adequate consideration ; capacity ; and legality . In some states , elements of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. Possible remedies for breach of contract include general damages , consequential damages , reliance damages , and specific performance . Background : Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. Contract law is generally governed by state common law , and while general overall contract law is common throughout the country, some specific court interpretations of a particular element of the contract may vary between the states. If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made. Elements -- Consideration and Mutual Assent Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. To be legally binding as a contract, a promise must be exchanged for adequate consideration. There are two different theories or definitions of consideration: Bargain Theory of Consideration and Benefit-Detriment theory of consideration. Benefit-Detriment Under the b enefit-detriment theory, an adequate consideration exists only when a promise made to the benefit of the promisor or to the detriment of the promisee, which reasonably and fairly induces the promisor to make a promise for something else for the promisee. For example, promises that are purely gifts are not considered enforceable because the personal satisfaction the grantor of the promise may receive from the act of generosity is normally not considered sufficient detriment to constitute adequate consideration. Bargain-for-Exchange Under Bargain-for-Exchange theory of consideration, adequate consideration exists when a promisor makes a promise in return for something else. Here, the essential condition is that the promisor was given something specifically to induce the promise being made. In other words, the bargain for exchange theory is different from the detriment-benefit theory in that the focus in bargain for exchange theory seems to be the parties\u2019 motive for making the promises and the parties\u2019 subjective mutual assent, while in detriment benefit theory, the focus seems to be an objective legal detriment or benefit to the parties. Governing Laws Contracts are mainly governed by state statutory and common (judge-made) law and private law (i.e. the private agreement). Private law principally includes the terms of the agreement between the parties who are exchanging promises. This private law may override many of the rules otherwise established by state law. Statutory law, such as the Statute of Fraud , may require some kinds of contracts be put in writing and executed with particular formalities, for the contract to be enforceable. Otherwise, the parties may enter into a binding agreement without signing a formal written document. For example, Virginia Supreme Court has held in Lucy v. Zehmer that even an agreement made on a piece of napkin can be considered a valid contract, if the parties were both sane, and showed mutual assent and consideration. Most of the principles of the common law of contracts are outlined in the Restatement of Law, Second Contracts published by the American Law Institute. The Uniform Commercial Code , whose original articles have been adopted in nearly every state, represents a body of statutory law that governs important categories of contracts. The main articles that deal with the law of contracts are Article 1 (General Provisions) and Article 2 (Sales) . Sections of Article 9 (",

        "justification": "The original contract language uses 'shall,' which creates a clear and enforceable obligation. The changed language uses 'endeavor to' and 'should aim to,' introducing ambiguity and weakening the obligation to perform. The Law Explanation accurately describes how this change makes proving a breach of contract more difficult, aligning with the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 235 principle that non-performance is a breach when a duty is due. The scraped law snippet mentions that a contract is an agreement creating mutual obligations enforceable by law. By making the obligation less definitive, the change weakens the enforceability of the agreement, thus contradicting the fundamental requirement that contracts create enforceable obligations. The shift introduces subjective interpretations ('reasonable timeframe,' 'significant portion') where objective certainty ('shall begin,' '[ * ]Distributor App') previously existed. This increases the difficulty in proving breach, a significant legal issue, leading to a high contradiction score."

        "justification": "The change from \"shall deliver\" to \"may attempt to deliver in a timely manner\" introduces ambiguity and weakens Google's obligation. The UCC \u00a7 1-304, as stated in the scraped law snippet, imposes an obligation of good faith in the performance of every contract. By making the delivery discretionary and the timeframe vague, Google potentially undermines the distributor's ability to rely on timely product delivery, impacting their own performance under the contract. While it doesn't explicitly violate the good faith obligation, it creates a significant risk of doing so, particularly if Google consistently fails to deliver or delivers unreasonably late. The change introduces a loophole that can be exploited, leading to a potential breach of the implied duty of good faith."

Replacing 'shall accurately reproduce' with 'should endeavor to accurately reproduce' softens the obligation.

        "justification": "The changed contract text introduces ambiguity, making it potentially more difficult to enforce the original intent of preventing malicious code insertion and unauthorized modifications. The LLM generated law explanation mentions the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and how weakening the prohibition against inserting malicious code and requiring proof of intent could potentially allow for actions that violate the spirit and purpose of the CFAA. However, without a specific snippet from the CFAA outlining exact prohibitions and standards of proof, it is difficult to ascertain a direct legal contradiction. The weakening of the language, moving from 'shall' to 'should endeavor' and introducing qualifiers like 'core functionality' and 'known viruses,' introduces ambiguity that could be exploited to circumvent the original restrictions. While the change doesn't explicitly permit illegal activity, it raises the bar for proving a violation, and therefore contradicts the likely intent of the law. Because the scraped law snippet is missing, this weakens the possibility of establishing a stronger and more definitive contradiction."

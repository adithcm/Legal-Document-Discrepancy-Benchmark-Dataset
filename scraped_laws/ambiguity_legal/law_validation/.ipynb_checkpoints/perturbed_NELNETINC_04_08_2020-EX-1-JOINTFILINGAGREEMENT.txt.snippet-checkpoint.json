        "changed_text": "The undersigned acknowledge that each should endeavor to be responsible for the timely filing of such amendments, and for the completeness and general accuracy of the information concerning her or it contained therein, and may rely on the other's information unless explicitly notified of inaccuracies.",
        "explanation": "Replacing 'shall be responsible' with 'should endeavor to be responsible' and adding 'general accuracy' introduces ambiguity and reduces the legal obligation for timely and accurate filing. Allowing reliance on the other's information unless 'explicitly notified' shifts the burden of due diligence, weakening individual responsibility.",

        "justification": "The original text likely contained a stricter obligation for timely and accurate filing, which aligns with the general intent of Rule 13d-1 to ensure transparency in ownership of equity securities. The modified text introduces ambiguity ('should endeavor') and shifts responsibility, potentially hindering the accurate and timely filing required by the rule. The law snippet confirms the filing requirement for beneficial owners of more than 5% of a class of equity security."

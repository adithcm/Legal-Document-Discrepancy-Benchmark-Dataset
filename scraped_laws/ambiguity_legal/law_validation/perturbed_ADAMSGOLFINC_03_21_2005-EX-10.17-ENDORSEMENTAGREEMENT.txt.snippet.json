        "original_text": "CONSULTANT'S OBLIGATIONS\n3. CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\nCONSULTANT hereby gives and grants to ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY.",
        "changed_text": "CONSULTANT'S OBLIGATIONS\n3. CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\nCONSULTANT hereby provides ADAMS GOLF with an opportunity to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the marketing of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY.",
        "explanation": "The original text grants ADAMS GOLF an 'exclusive right and license'. The modified text replaces this with 'opportunity to use,' which is a weaker, less definitive obligation. It's unclear if Adams Golf actually has the right to use the endorsement, or merely a chance to negotiate for it.",

        "law_url": "https://law.justia.com/codes/kansas/2022/chapter-84/article-1/section-84-1-103/",
        "law_explanation": "Kansas law, like most states, requires contractual obligations to be clearly defined. The original text establishes a clear obligation for the consultant to grant endorsement rights. The modified text introduces ambiguity, potentially rendering the endorsement clause unenforceable due to a lack of definite agreement on the scope and nature of the endorsement rights granted. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the contract, potentially rendering it void or voidable.",
        "location": "Section 3",
        "scraped_snippet": null,
        "confidence_score": 0.3,
        "justification": "The explanation relies on a general principle of contract law (definiteness of obligations) rather than a specific statute. While the change does introduce ambiguity, there is no specific Kansas law cited to back up the claim that this renders the contract unenforceable. The lack of a law snippet further weakens the connection."

        "original_text": "12. BEHAVIOR\nDuring the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT will conduct himself at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions. If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT:\nA.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude,\nB.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law,\nC.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community,\nD.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT.",
        "changed_text": "12. BEHAVIOR\nDuring the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT should generally conduct himself. If CONSULTANT'S actions, in Adams Golf's opinion, negatively impact their reputation, Adams Golf may consider taking action.",
        "explanation": "The original text sets out specific, measurable criteria for termination based on behavior. The modified text replaces this with subjective terms like 'generally conduct himself,' 'in Adams Golf's opinion,' and 'may consider taking action'. This makes enforcement highly discretionary and weakens the protection for Adams Golf.",

        "law_explanation": "Kansas law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. By making the behavior clause so subjective ('in Adams Golf's opinion'), Adams Golf could potentially terminate the contract for arbitrary reasons, violating this covenant. The original text had objective standards that limited Adams Golf's discretion and arbitrary use of the clause.",
        "location": "Section 12",
        "scraped_snippet": null,
        "confidence_score": 0.75,
        "justification": "The perturbation explanation accurately reflects a shift from objective to subjective termination criteria. The LLM correctly identifies the potential violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which exists in most jurisdictions, including Kansas. Although no specific statute is provided in the 'Scraped Law Snippet,' the general principle is valid, increasing the likelihood that the modification introduces an ambiguity allowing for bad faith termination. The missing statutory snippet slightly lowers the confidence."

APPROVAL OF ADVERTISING\nPrior to publishing or placing any advertising or promotional material which uses CONSULTANT'S name, facsimile signature, nickname, voice or likeness, ADAMS GOLF shall submit the same to CONSULTANT, or CONSULTANT'S designee, for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within three (3) business days or shall be deemed approved. ADAMS GOLF agrees to protect, indemnify and hold CONSULTANT harmless from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, arising out of, or in any way connected with, any advertising material furnished by, or on behalf of, the company.",
        "changed_text": "20. APPROVAL OF ADVERTISING\nPrior to publishing advertising that prominently features the CONSULTANT, ADAMS GOLF should attempt to get feedback. ADAMS GOLF will try to ensure CONSULANT is not negatively impacted.",
        "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation of Adams Golf. The original text 'shall submit...for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld' becomes 'should attempt to get feedback.' The indemnity clause is essentially removed, only providing that Adams Golf will 'try' to ensure the consultant is not negatively impacted. The term 'prominently features' is also ambiguous, potentially allowing Adams Golf to use the consultant's likeness in ways that do not trigger this clause.",

        "law_explanation": "While Kansas law generally allows for indemnification clauses, the weakened language removes any clear requirement for Adams Golf to indemnify the consultant against damages arising from advertising. The statement 'ADAMS GOLF will try to ensure CONSULANT is not negatively impacted' does not constitute a legally binding indemnification agreement, leaving the CONSULTANT vulnerable to liability without clear contractual protection.",
        "location": "Section 20",
        "scraped_snippet": null,
        "confidence_score": 0.6,
        "justification": "The LLM correctly identifies the weakening of the indemnification clause. While no specific statute is cited, the principle of indemnification is a well-established legal concept. The modification replaces a 'shall' obligation with a weaker 'should attempt' and dilutes the indemnification by using the phrase 'try to ensure.' This weakens the legal protection for the consultant. However, the lack of a specific statute lowers the confidence score."

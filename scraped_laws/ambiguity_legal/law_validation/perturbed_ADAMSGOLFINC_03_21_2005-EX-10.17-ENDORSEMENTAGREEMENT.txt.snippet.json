        "original_text": "CONSULTANT'S OBLIGATIONS\n3. CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\nCONSULTANT hereby gives and grants to ADAMS GOLF the exclusive right and license to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY.",
        "changed_text": "CONSULTANT'S OBLIGATIONS\n3. CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT\nCONSULTANT hereby provides ADAMS GOLF with an opportunity to use CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT in connection with the marketing of PRODUCT in the CONTRACT TERRITORY.",
        "explanation": "The original text grants ADAMS GOLF an 'exclusive right and license'. The modified text replaces this with 'opportunity to use,' which is a weaker, less definitive obligation. It's unclear if Adams Golf actually has the right to use the endorsement, or merely a chance to negotiate for it.",

        "law_explanation": "Kansas law, like most states, requires contractual obligations to be clearly defined. The original text establishes a clear obligation for the consultant to grant endorsement rights. The modified text introduces ambiguity, potentially rendering the endorsement clause unenforceable due to a lack of definite agreement on the scope and nature of the endorsement rights granted. This ambiguity undermines the enforceability of the contract, potentially rendering it void or voidable.",

        "justification": "The original text grants an 'exclusive right and license' to ADAMS GOLF, creating a defined and legally binding obligation for the consultant to allow the use of their endorsement. The changed text replaces this with 'opportunity to use,' which introduces a significant ambiguity. While the scraped law snippet is missing, the LLM-generated law explanation states that Kansas law, like most states, requires contractual obligations to be clearly defined. Replacing the grant of an exclusive right with a mere 'opportunity' casts doubt on whether Adams Golf actually possesses the right to use the endorsement, or if further negotiation is required. This ambiguity undermines the definiteness of the agreement, making it potentially unenforceable, and thus contradicts the principle of clear contractual obligations. Therefore, there is a strong contradiction, as the modified clause creates uncertainty where there was previously a clear legal right."

If the value of CONSULTANT'S ENDORSEMENT is materially reduced or impaired because CONSULTANT:\nA.committed or shall commit any public act that involves moral turpitude,\nB.commits or violates any material foreign, U.S., federal, or other applicable state or local law,\nC.commits any act which brings him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which insults or offends the community,\nD.makes any statements in derogation, in any material respect, of ADAMS GOLF or any of its affiliates or any of their respective PRODUCT or services and such statement is made to the general public or becomes a matter of public knowledge, then at any time after the occurrence of such act, thing or statement, ADAMS GOLF shall have the right, in addition to its other legal and equitable remedies, to immediately terminate this Agreement, by giving written notice to CONSULTANT.",
        "changed_text": "12. BEHAVIOR\nDuring the term of this Agreement, CONSULTANT should generally conduct himself. If CONSULTANT'S actions, in Adams Golf's opinion, negatively impact their reputation, Adams Golf may consider taking action.",
        "explanation": "The original text sets out specific, measurable criteria for termination based on behavior. The modified text replaces this with subjective terms like 'generally conduct himself,' 'in Adams Golf's opinion,' and 'may consider taking action'. This makes enforcement highly discretionary and weakens the protection for Adams Golf.",

        "law_explanation": "Kansas law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. By making the behavior clause so subjective ('in Adams Golf's opinion'), Adams Golf could potentially terminate the contract for arbitrary reasons, violating this covenant. The original text had objective standards that limited Adams Golf's discretion and arbitrary use of the clause.",
        "location": "Section 12",
        "scraped_snippet": null,
        "contradiction_score": 0.6,
        "justification": "The modification significantly weakens the behavior clause, replacing objective criteria with subjective assessments like 'in Adams Golf's opinion' and discretionary actions such as 'may consider taking action.' The original clause provided specific grounds for termination based on actions that could materially reduce the value of the consultant's endorsement, while the changed text grants Adams Golf broad discretion. While there is no scraped law snippet, the Law Explanation correctly identifies that Kansas law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. The change allows Adams Golf to terminate the contract for arbitrary reasons, potentially violating this implied covenant. Therefore, the revised contract text introduces a potential contradiction with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Kansas law."

APPROVAL OF ADVERTISING\nPrior to publishing or placing any advertising or promotional material which uses CONSULTANT'S name, facsimile signature, nickname, voice or likeness, ADAMS GOLF shall submit the same to CONSULTANT, or CONSULTANT'S designee, for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If CONSULTANT disapproves, the reasons therefore shall be given to ADAMS GOLF in writing within three (3) business days or shall be deemed approved. ADAMS GOLF agrees to protect, indemnify and hold CONSULTANT harmless from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, arising out of, or in any way connected with, any advertising material furnished by, or on behalf of, the company.",

        "explanation": "This change weakens the legal obligation of Adams Golf. The original text 'shall submit...for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld' becomes 'should attempt to get feedback.' The indemnity clause is essentially removed, only providing that Adams Golf will 'try' to ensure the consultant is not negatively impacted. The term 'prominently features' is also ambiguous, potentially allowing Adams Golf to use the consultant's likeness in ways that do not trigger this clause.",

        "law_explanation": "While Kansas law generally allows for indemnification clauses, the weakened language removes any clear requirement for Adams Golf to indemnify the consultant against damages arising from advertising. The statement 'ADAMS GOLF will try to ensure CONSULANT is not negatively impacted' does not constitute a legally binding indemnification agreement, leaving the CONSULTANT vulnerable to liability without clear contractual protection.",
        "location": "Section 20",
        "scraped_snippet": null,
        "contradiction_score": 0.7,
        "justification": "The original contract language stipulates a clear process for advertising approval, requiring ADAMS GOLF to submit materials to the CONSULTANT for approval, which could not be unreasonably withheld. It also contained a standard indemnity clause. The changed text significantly weakens these obligations. The 'shall submit...for approval' is replaced with 'should attempt to get feedback,' which is a non-binding suggestion rather than a requirement. The original indemnity clause, which provided clear protection for the CONSULTANT, is replaced with a vague promise that ADAMS GOLF will 'try' to ensure the consultant is not negatively impacted. This does not create a legally binding indemnification agreement, as the original text did. While the scraped law snippet does not directly address indemnity clauses, the change weakens the legal protections afforded to the CONSULTANT under the original agreement, increasing their potential exposure to liability. The Law Explanation accurately notes that the modified language does not constitute a legally binding indemnification agreement."

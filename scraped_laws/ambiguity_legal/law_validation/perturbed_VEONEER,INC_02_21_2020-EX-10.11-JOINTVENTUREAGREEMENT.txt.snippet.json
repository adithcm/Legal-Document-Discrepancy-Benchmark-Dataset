        "justification": "The original contract text mandates that the Amendment is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan, setting a clear legal standard. The changed text introduces ambiguity by stating the amendment will be 'generally construed with reference to the principles of Japanese law' but then permits 'discretion of the involved parties' for specific interpretations. While the scraped law snippet provided does not directly address contractual interpretation standards beyond general principles of good faith (which is only mentioned in the LLM's law explanation), the alteration weakens the initial commitment to be wholly governed by Japanese law. By allowing parties' 'discretion,' it opens the door for interpretations that may not fully align with Japanese legal principles, thus creating a potential, though not definitive, conflict. The ambiguity weakens the enforceability of the contract in accordance with Japanese law, and thus has a moderate contradiction score."

The modified text weakens this obligation significantly. Replacing 'agree to cause each of VNBJ and VNBZ to comply with' with 'will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ consider complying with' transforms a definite obligation into a vague and discretionary one. The use of phrases like 'potential indemnification or reimbursement, if applicable,' and 'concerning certain Liabilities possibly arising' introduces further ambiguity and reduces the certainty of the original obligation. The change from 'indemnification or reimbursement' to 'potential indemnification or reimbursement' introduces more doubt about the guarantee.",

Allowing only 'commercially reasonable efforts' instead of ensuring compliance does not fully uphold the expected duty of care to those Directors and Officers.",

        "justification": "The modified text weakens the obligation to indemnify directors and officers, potentially conflicting with the spirit of director's duties, although the scraped law snippet does not directly address indemnification. The original contract ensured compliance with JV Agreement sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 regarding indemnification. The revised contract uses 'commercially reasonable efforts to ensure VNBJ and VNBZ consider complying,' significantly reducing the commitment. While the provided law snippet regarding 'Specified Partner Registration Ordinance' is not directly relevant to the duty of loyalty or indemnification of directors and officers under the Japanese Commercial Code, the Law Explanation suggests that weakening indemnification could be construed as a breach of the director's duty of loyalty. The change from a definitive obligation to one based on 'commercially reasonable efforts' introduces ambiguity and reduces the protection afforded to directors and officers, indirectly clashing with the general principles of director's duties, giving a moderate contradiction score."

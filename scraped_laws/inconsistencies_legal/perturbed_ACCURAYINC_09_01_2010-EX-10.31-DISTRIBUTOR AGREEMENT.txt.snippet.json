        "changed_text": "Accuray shall either accept or reject such Purchase Order within 7 calendar days after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval.",
        "explanation": "Reducing the purchase order approval/rejection timeframe to 7 days may be unreasonably short and conflict with general contract law principles requiring reasonable time for review, especially for complex medical equipment purchases. This could be seen as bad faith dealing, depending on the specifics.",

Depending on the exact setting, good faith may require an honest belief or purpose, faithful performance of duties , observance of fair dealing standards, or an absence of fraudulent intent . A fiduciary relationship creates a duty of good faith between the agent and the principal . The breach of this duty of good faith can lead to liability . Failure to act in good faith is known as bad faith and is generally considered to be a level of culpability greater than negligence .

        "explanation": "Reducing the availability of support services and spare parts to only one year could violate consumer protection laws, particularly if the product has a longer expected lifespan. This would reduce the reasonable time to receive support on a product where the expected life span is significantly longer, thereby reducing access to replacement parts.",

        "law_explanation": "The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act indirectly requires reasonable availability of services and parts for the duration of the implied warranty of merchantability.

        "changed_text": "All payments will be paid by Adaptimmune within 90 days of receipt of an invoice from MD Anderson.",
        "explanation": "Changing the payment timeline to 90 days could violate prompt payment laws in some states. While Texas, where MD Anderson is located, does not have a general prompt payment law applicable to all contracts, extending payment terms significantly without justification could be deemed commercially unreasonable or conflict with implied duties of good faith and fair dealing.",

        "law_explanation": "Although Texas doesn't have a specific prompt payment law for private contracts of this nature, extending payment terms to 90 days without justification or mutual agreement may be considered a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in all contracts under Texas law. This duty requires parties to act honestly and reasonably in the performance and enforcement of their contractual obligations. Unreasonably delaying payments can constitute a violation of this duty.",

        "explanation": "Reducing the confidentiality period to one year may be insufficient to protect trade secrets under Texas law, especially considering the advanced research involved.

A one-year confidentiality period for sensitive research data, especially in a rapidly evolving field, may not be considered a 'reasonable measure' to maintain secrecy, particularly if the information has a longer commercial lifespan.

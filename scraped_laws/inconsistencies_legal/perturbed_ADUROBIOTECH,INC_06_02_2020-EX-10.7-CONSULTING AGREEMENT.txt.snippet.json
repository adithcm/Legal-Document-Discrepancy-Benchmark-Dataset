        "law_explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2751 requires a written contract for independent contractors that includes the rate of pay and method of payment. While not explicitly stating a payment deadline, extending it to 60 days could be deemed unreasonable and potentially conflict with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, depending on industry standards and the nature of the services provided. A 30-day period is a more common and accepted business practice, while doubling that period could be seen as an attempt to delay payments unreasonably.",

        "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 generally prohibits contracts that restrain a person from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business. While non-solicitation agreements are not per se invalid, a 24-month restriction, especially without geographic limitations, could be deemed an unreasonable restraint on the Consultant's ability to practice their profession, making it unenforceable under California law. Courts examine the specific facts and circumstances to determine reasonableness, but a longer duration increases the likelihood of unenforceability.",

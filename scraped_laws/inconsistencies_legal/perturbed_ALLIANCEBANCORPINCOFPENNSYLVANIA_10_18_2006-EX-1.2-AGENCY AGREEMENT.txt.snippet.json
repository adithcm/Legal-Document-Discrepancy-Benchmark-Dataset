        "explanation": "Reducing the agent's appointment period to 15 days after the offering may contradict regulations related to securities offerings, which often require a longer period for post-offering stabilization and compliance activities. This creates a tight timeline that may be inconsistent with industry standards and regulatory expectations.",

        "explanation": "The original text establishes a 180-day lock-up period for the company's stock. Shortening this period to 30 days could conflict with standard underwriting practices and SEC Rule 144, which regulates the resale of restricted and controlled securities.

        "law_explanation": "SEC Rule 144 requires a holding period before restricted securities can be resold.

CFR Table of Popular Names prev | next § 230.144 Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not underwriters. Preliminary Note: Certain basic principles are essential to an understanding of the registration requirements in the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act or the Securities Act) and the purposes underlying Rule 144: 1. If any person sells a non-exempt security to any other person, the sale must be registered unless an exemption can be found for the transaction. 2. Section 4(1) of the Securities Act provides one such exemption for a transaction “by a person other than an issuer , underwriter , or dealer.” Therefore, an understanding of the term “underwriter” is important in determining whether or not the Section 4(1) exemption from registration is available for the sale of the securities. The term “underwriter” is broadly defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security , or participates , or has a direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking. The interpretation of this definition traditionally has focused on the words “with a view to” in the phrase “purchased from an issuer with a view to * * * distribution .” An investment banking firm which arranges with an issuer for the public sale of its securities is clearly an “underwriter” under that section. However, individual investors who are not professionals in the securities business also may be “underwrit"

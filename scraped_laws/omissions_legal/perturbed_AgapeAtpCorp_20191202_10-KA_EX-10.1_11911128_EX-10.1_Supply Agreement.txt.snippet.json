This includes without limitation laws relating to business practice, workplace relations, safety and taxation.",
        "changed_text": "3.1 Compliance with Local Laws and Regulations The Manufacturer covenants that it will endeavor to comply with Local Laws and Regulations where commercially reasonable. This includes laws relating to business practice, workplace relations, safety and taxation.",
        "explanation": "Changing \"is and will remain in compliance\" to \"will endeavor to comply where commercially reasonable\" weakens the commitment to legal compliance. The Manufacturer is based in Vanuatu. Vanuatu's employment act states the employer should maintain a safe and healthy working environment.",

        "law_explanation": "This modification contradicts Vanuatu Labour Law [CAP 160], Part 3 s.36 which requires all businesses to ensure a safe workplace. By stating it will comply only when commercially reasonable, it potentially violates this law.",

        "original_text": "5.3 Rejection of defective products The Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer shall within seven (7) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either: (i) request to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or (ii) request a Return Material Authorization (\"RMA\") number and within seven (7) days of receipt of the RMA number from the Manufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer. Products not rejected within the foregoing time periods shall be deemed accepted by the Customer. In the event that the Manufacturer determines that the returned Product is defective and properly rejected by the Customer, the Manufacturer shall credit to the Customer the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs.",
        "changed_text": "5.3 Rejection of defective products The Customer shall inspect all Products upon receipt thereof. Products not rejected within fourteen (14) days shall be deemed accepted by the Customer. In the event that the Manufacturer determines that the returned Product is defective, the Manufacturer may, at its sole discretion, offer a credit to the Customer.",
        "explanation": "This change removes the requirement for the Customer to notify the Manufacturer within 7 days of rejecting a product as defective, which weakens the manufacturer's obligation to confirm or deny the customer's claim. It also gives sole discretion to the manufacturer, violating laws that require manufacturers to refund customers. This applies to any jurisdiction but has been specified in relation to Hong Kong.",

        "law_explanation": "In Hong Kong, Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26) Section 15 states that products should be of merchantable quality. Removing the RMA process and giving the manufacturer sole discretion over credits effectively weakens the consumer's right to a refund or replacement for defective goods, potentially violating this ordinance.",

        "original_text": "8. ARBITRATION 8.1 Any and all disputes, claims or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement or the alleged breach thereto shall be settled by mutual consultation between the parties in good faith as promptly as possible but failing such amicable settlement, shall be decided by Arbitration by the Arbitration Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce located in Switzerland.",
        "changed_text": "8. ARBITRATION 8.1 Any and all disputes, claims or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement or the alleged breach thereto shall be decided by Arbitration at a location solely determined by the Manufacturer.",
        "explanation": "This change gives the Manufacturer the sole right to decide the arbitration location, potentially violating the principle of fair arbitration. Since the agreement defaults to English law, the contract must comply with the Arbitration Act 1996.",

        "law_explanation": "Section 45, which touches upon judicial involvement in arbitration, can be deemed as being impacted by clauses that unduly favour one party by restricting access to fair arbitration by specifying terms which are overly detrimental to another party. The choice of arbitration location can unfairly disadvantage the Customer. This violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the Arbitration Act 1996.",

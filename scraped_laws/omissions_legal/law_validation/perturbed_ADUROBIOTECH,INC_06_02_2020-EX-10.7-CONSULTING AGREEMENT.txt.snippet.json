Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.",
        "changed_text": "Aduro shall be the owner of the physical embodiments of any writings, documents, work product, inventions, developments, improvements, discoveries, know-how, processes, chemical entities, compounds, plans, memoranda, tests, research, designs, specifications, models and data that Consultant makes, conceives, discovers or develops, either solely or jointly with any other person in performance of the Services (collectively, \"Work Product\"). Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro.  At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in physically transferring any Work Product.",
        "explanation": "This change removes the assignment of intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks) to Aduro, and limits Aduro's ownership to physical embodiments of the Work Product. It removes the section where consultant irrevocably assigns and transfers all rights to Aduro, creating a legal contradiction in California where intellectual property assignment is heavily regulated and this clause is often used to ensure IP transfer.",

        "law_explanation": "California Labor Code Section 2870 limits the scope of agreements requiring employees to assign rights in their inventions to their employers. By removing the explicit assignment of intellectual property and limiting Aduro's ownership, the modified text creates ambiguity regarding the ownership of intellectual property developed by the consultant, potentially contradicting the intent and protections afforded under California law. The original text was structured to proactively ensure IP assignment, while the edited text does not make clear about all intellectual property rights, thereby weakening protection under California law.",

(b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.

        "justification": "The original contract text included an assignment of all intellectual property rights from the consultant to Aduro. The changed text removes this assignment, limiting Aduro's ownership to the physical embodiments of the work product. The Perturbation Explanation states this might create a contradiction in California due to regulations around IP assignment. The Law Explanation suggests that California Labor Code Section 2870 is relevant, as it limits the scope of agreements requiring employees to assign invention rights. The scraped law snippet of California Labor Code Section 2870(a) states that an agreement requiring an employee to assign rights to an invention does not apply if the employee developed it on their own time without using the employer's resources, unless it relates to the employer's business or results from work for the employer. Removing the IP assignment clause in the changed text weakens the contract's protection of Aduro's IP rights. While the original clause might have been overly broad and potentially unenforceable under 2870(a) in some circumstances, its removal creates uncertainty and could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the protections that Aduro might have been entitled to, especially if the invention relates to Aduro's business or resulted from the consultant's work for Aduro, and does create a moderate contradiction."

        "explanation": "While parties can generally agree on a choice of law, certain California laws are considered so fundamental to public policy that they apply to contracts performed in California, regardless of the choice of law provision.

(a) The following provisions of a contract between the contractor and a subcontractor with principal offices in this state, for the construction of a public or private work of improvement in this state, shall be void and unenforceable: (1) A provision which purports to require any dispute between the parties to be litigated, arbitrated, or otherwise determined outside this state.

        "contradiction_score": 0.6,
        "justification": "The change from California to Delaware law in the choice of law provision introduces a potential contradiction based on California's public policy exceptions to choice of law principles. The scraped law snippet, CCP 410.42, specifically addresses construction contracts and prohibits waiving California law regarding disputes for work performed in California. While the original and changed text do not involve a construction contract (as stated in the LLM Law explanation), the underlying principle that California law can override choice of law provisions under certain circumstances relating to public policy is relevant. The perturbation explanation argues that changing the choice of law opens the door to less protective laws, which aligns with the general concept that California has specific protections it deems important, regardless of contractual choice. This is not a direct contradiction, as CCP 410.42 only covers construction, but it is a related principle that weakens the legal certainty of choosing Delaware law, creating a potential contradiction if the contract is subject to mandatory California laws or public policies."

        "explanation": "This change removes the clause allowing Aduro to recover direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, and/or punitive damages in the event of a breach of the non-solicitation agreement.

        "law_explanation": "California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 prohibits unfair competition. While this section doesn't explicitly mandate specific damages, it provides a broad framework for addressing unfair business practices, including employee solicitation. By limiting Aduro's remedies to injunctive relief only, the contract might be seen as unduly restricting the company's ability to address unfair competition resulting from a breach of the non-solicitation agreement, going against the spirit of California's law.",

        "justification": "The original contract allowed Aduro to recover direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, and/or punitive damages for a breach of Paragraph 7. The changed contract limits Aduro's remedy to only injunctive relief. The Law Explanation suggests this might conflict with California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, which prohibits unfair competition, because limiting remedies could restrict Aduro's ability to address unfair competition. However, the scraped law snippet for BPC 17200 defines unfair competition as 'any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice'. While removing the damages clause might weaken Aduro's position, it doesn't inherently constitute an 'unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice' on the Consultant's part. The original contract's inclusion of a broad range of damages is a contractual choice, and removing it doesn't automatically violate BPC 17200. Therefore, while the change may reduce Aduro's protection against potential breaches, it does not directly contradict the cited law. The contradiction arises from the interpretation of what remedies are 'fair' under the unfair competition statute, and the removal of the clause doesn't necessarily render the contract unfair, even though it makes Aduro more vulnerable."

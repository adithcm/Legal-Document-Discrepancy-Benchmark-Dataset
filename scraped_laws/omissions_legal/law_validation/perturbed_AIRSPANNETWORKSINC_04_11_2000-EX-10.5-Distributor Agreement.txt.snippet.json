        "explanation": "By removing the phrase \"INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\" the contract attempts to disclaim implied warranties, which may be restricted or unenforceable under South Dakota law, specifically the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in South Dakota. This creates legal risk as implied warranties provide certain baseline protections to the distributor.",

        "law_explanation": "SDCL 57A-2-314 establishes the implied warranty of merchantability, ensuring goods are fit for ordinary purposes. SDCL 57A-2-315 establishes the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. While disclaimers are possible, they must be conspicuous and meet certain requirements. Removing the explicit mention of these warranties creates ambiguity and a higher risk of the disclaimer being deemed unenforceable, violating the spirit and intent of the UCC provisions as adopted in South Dakota.",

        "justification": "The original contract explicitly disclaims implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The changed contract omits this specific disclaimer, creating a potential contradiction with South Dakota's adoption of the UCC (as suggested by the Law Explanation, though a specific snippet is unavailable). While the original contract aims for a full disclaimer, the altered contract leaves room for interpretation and potential liability under implied warranty law, increasing the risk of violating UCC provisions if the disclaimer is deemed insufficiently clear. The Perturbation Explanation highlights this increased legal risk, indicating a significant weakening of the disclaimer's effectiveness."

        "original_text": "8.1 All Equipment and Software will be delivered by Airspan CIP (as defined in Incoterms 2000) to an airport in South Dakota that completes international customs clearances and shipped to a location within the city limits of the above arrival airport, such airport and delivery location are to be agreed upon in writing by the parties for each Purchase Order. Airspan will be responsible for and pay all packing, shipping, freight, and insurance charges to the agreed upon location within the city limits.",
        "changed_text": "8.1 All Equipment and Software will be delivered to an airport in South Dakota.  Distributor will be responsible for all packing, shipping, freight, and insurance charges.",
        "explanation": "By shifting the responsibility of packing, shipping, freight, and insurance charges to the distributor, the contract could potentially violate the UCC provisions related to risk of loss and delivery terms if not explicitly and conspicuously agreed upon. This creates a legal risk, as South Dakota law provides default rules for these aspects of a sale.",
        "contradicted_law": "South Dakota Codified Laws Chapter 57A-2 - Sales, specifically sections 57A-2-319 through 57A-2-324 and 57A-2-509.",

        "law_explanation": "These sections of the South Dakota UCC address the meaning of delivery terms (e.g., FOB, CIF) and the passage of risk of loss. By removing the specific Incoterms reference and shifting all responsibility to the distributor, the contract deviates from standard commercial practice and may be interpreted in a way that is unfavorable to the distributor and inconsistent with the implied obligations under the UCC if the distributor is not made aware that they are agreeing to very onerous terms.",

        "contradiction_score": 0.6,
        "justification": "The changed contract text removes the Incoterms reference (CIP) and shifts responsibility for packing, shipping, freight, and insurance to the distributor. The Law Explanation suggests that this deviation from standard commercial practice may be unfavorable to the distributor and inconsistent with implied obligations under the UCC. The Perturbation Explanation suggests this could violate UCC provisions related to risk of loss and delivery terms if not explicitly agreed upon. While the scraped law snippet is unavailable, the arguments presented suggest a potential contradiction with the UCC, specifically concerning risk of loss and delivery. The original contract clearly defined Airspan's responsibility based on Incoterms. By removing this and assigning all responsibility to the distributor, the changed text arguably contradicts the UCC's default provisions, creating a potentially legally unfavorable situation for the distributor, especially if they were not fully aware of the onerous terms. Without the scraped law snippet, a full analysis is not possible; however, the change creates a significant potential for contradiction."

        "original_text": "7.1 Airspan will issue an invoice (the \"Invoice\") to Distributor in accordance with the payment terms below. The Invoice specifically will identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract Price of such items. Any Installation Services or other services provided by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such services. The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price, and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.",
        "changed_text": "7.1 Airspan will issue an invoice (the \"Invoice\") to Distributor in accordance with the payment terms below.  Payment of the Invoice Total is due at Airspan's discretion.",
        "explanation": "By removing the net forty-five (45) day payment term and replacing it with 'Airspan's discretion', the contract becomes vague and potentially unconscionable. This introduces a legal risk as it fails to define payment terms clearly, contradicting principles of good faith and fair dealing implied under contract law and the UCC in South Dakota.",
        "contradicted_law": "South Dakota Codified Laws Chapter 57A-2 - Sales and general contract law principles of good faith and fair dealing.",

        "law_url": "https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=57A-1-304",
        "law_explanation": "SDCL 57A-1-304 imposes an obligation of good faith in the performance and enforcement of contracts under the UCC.  Leaving payment terms entirely to Airspan's discretion raises concerns about whether Airspan would act in good faith. This could lead to legal challenges based on breach of contract or unconscionability.",

        "scraped_snippet": "Loading... | South Dakota Legislature We're sorry but South Dakota Legislature Website doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue. Your browser is not supported Please update your browser or download one of the following browsers: Chrome Firefox Edge",
        "contradiction_score": 0.7,
        "justification": "The original contract specifies a net 45-day payment term. The changed contract replaces this with 'Payment of the Invoice Total is due at Airspan's discretion.' This change introduces significant ambiguity and uncertainty regarding payment terms, which is a key component of the contract. While the scraped law snippet could not be retrieved to definitively establish a violation, the Law Explanation points to SDCL 57A-1-304 regarding good faith under the UCC, suggesting that giving one party complete discretion over payment terms could violate this principle. The Perturbation Explanation correctly highlights the potential for unconscionability and breach of good faith. Thus, the changed text creates a significant potential contradiction with the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, especially under the UCC. The absence of a specified payment term leaves the distributor vulnerable and introduces a high degree of uncertainty into the agreement, increasing the potential for legal challenge. Therefore, a contradiction score of 0.7 is appropriate."

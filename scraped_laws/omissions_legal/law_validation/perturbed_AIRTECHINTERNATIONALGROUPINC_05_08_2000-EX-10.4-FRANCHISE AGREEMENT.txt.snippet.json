VIRTUAL CURRENCY Sec. 12.001. DEFINITION. In this chapter, \"virtual currency\": (1) means a digital representation of value that: (A) is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value; and (B) is not legal tender, whether or not denominated in legal tender; and (2) does not include: (A) a transaction in which a merchant grants, as part of an affinity or rewards program, value that cannot be taken from or exchanged with the merchant for legal tender, bank credit, or virtual currency; or (B) a digital representation of value issued by or on behalf of a publisher and used solely within an online game, game platform, or family of games sold by the same publisher or offered on the same game platform. Added by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 739 (H.B. 4474 ), Sec. 9, eff. September 1, 2021. Sec. 12.002. SCOPE. This chapter applies to virtual currency. Added by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 739 (H.B. 4474 ), Sec. 9, eff. September 1, 2021. Sec. 12.003. RIGHTS IN VIRTUAL CURRENCY. (a) In this section: (1) \"Adverse claim\" means a claim that a claimant has a property interest in a virtual currency and that it is a violation of the rights of the claimant for another person to hold, transfer, or deal with the virtual currency. (2) \"Qualifying purchaser\" means a purchaser that obtains control of a virtual currency for value and without notice of any adverse claim. (b) Subject to Subsections (c) through (h), law other than this chapter determines whether a person acquires rights in a virtual currency and the rights that the person acquires. (c) A purchaser of a virtual currency acquires all rights in the virtual currency that the transferor had or had power to transfer. (d) A purchaser of a limited interest in a virtual currency acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. (e) In addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser, a qualifying purchaser acquires the purchaser's rights in a virtual currency free of any adverse claim. (f) An action based on an adverse claim to a virtual currency, whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory, may not be asserted against a qualifying purchaser that acquires the purchaser's interest in, and obtains control of, the virtual currency for value and without notice of the adverse claim. (g) A person has notice of an adverse claim if: (1) the person knows of the adverse claim; or (2) the person is aware of facts sufficient to indicate that there is a significant probability that the adverse claim exists and deliberately avoids information that would establish the existence of the adverse claim. (h) Filing of a financing statement under Chapter 9 is not notice of an adverse claim to a virtual currency. Added by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 739 (H.B. 4474 ), Sec. 9, eff. September 1, 2021.

        "justification": "The removed phrase 'provided such upgrade or remodel is reasonable in terms of cost and implementation schedule' weakens the franchisee's protection against potentially unfair demands for upgrades or remodels. The Law Explanation suggests this contradicts Texas Business & Commerce Code \u00a712.003, implying a duty of good faith and fair dealing. However, the Scraped Law Snippet defines virtual currency and related rights (Sec. 12.003 addresses 'Rights in Virtual Currency'). It does not directly address franchise agreements or the duty of good faith in the context of franchise operations or upgrade requirements. Thus, while the change may be arguably unfair and potentially open to challenge under general principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law (not specifically addressed in the provided law snippet), the scraped law snippet does not directly support a contradiction. The link between the modified text and the provided law is weak, hence the low contradiction score."

        "explanation": "Removing the requirement for 'Comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00' weakens the franchisee's insurance obligations.

        "law_explanation": "The omission contradicts the general principle of carrying sufficient liability insurance to cover business risks. While there's no single statute mandating a specific amount for every business, the absence of a defined minimum in the contract creates a situation where the franchisee may be underinsured, potentially violating implicit legal expectations and increasing the risk of legal action against both the franchisee and, potentially, the franchisor. Although not explicitly breaking a specific law, it ignores a key principle of risk management and compliance that is implicit in business regulations.",

        "justification": "The omission of 'Comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00' does weaken the franchisee's insurance obligations, as stated in the perturbation explanation. The original contract specifies a minimum amount for this insurance. The changed text removes this specific requirement, potentially leaving the franchisee underinsured. While the scraped law snippet is 'None,' indicating no specific statute mandates a particular insurance amount, the law explanation suggests that the change might violate implicit legal expectations related to risk management and compliance. Although there is no direct contradiction of a specific law, the removal of a previously defined minimum insurance coverage raises concerns about fulfilling the broader legal duty to carry sufficient liability insurance, justifying a contradiction score greater than 0 but less than 0.5."

        "justification": "The changed contract text alters the governing law from Texas to 'Country X'. The Law Explanation suggests that this change removes the protections afforded to the franchisee under Texas law, such as the implied duty of good faith and restrictions on unfair practices. However, the provided scraped law snippet pertains to virtual currency (specifically, the Texas Business and Commerce Code Chapter 12). The original and changed contract texts make no mention of virtual currency, and the core of the agreement appears to concern standard contractual terms. Therefore, while changing the governing law *could* potentially omit certain protections, it doesn't directly contradict the specific law provided in the scraped snippet related to virtual currency. The contradiction score is low because the change is not directly related to the provided law snippet."

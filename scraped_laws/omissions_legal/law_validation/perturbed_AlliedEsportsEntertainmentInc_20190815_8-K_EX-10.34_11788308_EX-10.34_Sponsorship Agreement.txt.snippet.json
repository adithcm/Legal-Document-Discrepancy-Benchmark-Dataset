(2) A warranty under subdivision (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have. (3) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.

        "justification": "The original contract text includes an indemnification clause (12.1(c)) covering claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. The changed text omits this clause. The Law Explanation posits that this omission might not sufficiently disclaim the implied warranty against infringement under California Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2312. The Scraped Law Snippet, specifically COM 2312(3), states that 'unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like'. While the original contract provided specific indemnification, removing it creates ambiguity as to whether the warranty against infringement is effectively disclaimed. Although the contract doesn't explicitly contradict the law, the omission significantly weakens the Indemnitee's protection regarding IP claims, potentially leading to a situation where the implied warranty of non-infringement applies without clear contractual recourse. This creates a moderate contradiction because while not directly violating the law, it undermines protections that the law anticipates parties can agree to."

Before any Party (the \"Complaining Party\") may bring any legal proceeding against the other (the \"Non Complaining Party\"), the Complaining Party shall first make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve all disputes privately by notifying and providing to the Non Complaining Party of the Complaining Party's complaints, reasons and supporting evidence for the complaints, and the reasonable steps Complaining Party would like the Non Complaining Party to take in order to address the complaints. If for any reason the Non-Complaining Party disagrees with either the complaint or the steps suggested to address the complaints, the Parties shall discuss and work on an amicable solution for at least thirty (30) days before the Complaining Party may bring any legal proceeding to resolve the complaints. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, by an arbitrator of JAMS, in accordance with its arbitration rules and procedures then in effect.

        "explanation": "Removing the requirement for pre-litigation dispute resolution (good faith attempt to resolve disputes privately and subsequent discussion) directly contradicts the California Rules of Court regarding alternative dispute resolution. Many California courts require or strongly encourage parties to participate in mediation or other forms of ADR before proceeding to trial. Omitting this clause bypasses this process, potentially leading to unnecessary litigation costs and delays. Furthermore, removing the arbitration clause removes the requirement to arbitrate the dispute. This is a drastic measure and will impact the costs of any legal disputes.",

        "justification": "The original contract mandated pre-litigation dispute resolution efforts, including a good-faith attempt to resolve disputes privately and subsequent discussion, as well as mandatory arbitration. The changed contract removes these requirements. The LLM's law explanation suggests that this removal contradicts the spirit and intent of encouraging alternative dispute resolution, potentially violating California Rules of Court. While the scraped law snippet is missing, the Perturbation Explanation highlights that many California courts encourage or require ADR before trial. The omission of the ADR clauses in the changed contract increases the likelihood of direct litigation, which undermines the general legal preference and potential court requirements for ADR in California. Therefore, a notable legal contradiction is present, though not a direct violation of a specific statute since the scraped law snippet is not available to directly contradict the contract change, but a reasonable contradiction of legal spirit."

        "justification": "The omission of the warranty regarding the use of Newegg's Marks violating laws or third-party rights creates a potential contradiction with California Civil Code Section 1655. The original contract explicitly provided an assurance that the use of the marks would not infringe on any third-party rights or violate any laws. By removing this assurance, the modified contract becomes arguably less 'reasonable' as it pertains to intellectual property licensing. According to the scraped law snippet, 'Stipulations which are necessary to make a contract reasonable... are implied... concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.' While the omission doesn't explicitly contradict the law (the law implies terms rather than mandating specific clauses), the removal of a standard warranty of non-infringement in an IP licensing agreement could be interpreted as making the contract less reasonable, thus opening the door to the implication of such a warranty under California law. The level of contradiction is moderate, because the law doesn't directly state the warranty must exist, but the omission can permit a court to imply that such a warranty was required to be reasonable."

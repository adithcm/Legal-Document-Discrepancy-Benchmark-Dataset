        "justification": "The omission of the statement 'the deposit accounts of the Association are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits' creates a significant legal issue. While a scraped law snippet explicitly requiring this specific disclosure is not provided, the Perturbation Explanation and Law Explanation suggest this disclosure is legally mandated to inform depositors about deposit insurance. Removing this statement can be seen as a failure to disclose a crucial consumer protection detail, creating a potential contradiction with laws mandating transparency regarding deposit insurance for savings and loan associations. The changed text, by omitting this information, arguably contradicts the implicit legal requirement for such disclosure, meriting a high contradiction score."

If you have questions concerning the meaning or application of a particular law, please consult with an attorney who specializes in securities law. Securities Act of 1933 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Trust Indenture Act of 1939 Investment Company Act of 1940 Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 Rules and Regulations Securities Act of 1933 Often referred to as the \"truth in securities\" law, the Securities Act of 1933 has two basic objectives: require that investors receive financial and other significant information concerning securities being offered for public sale; and prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities. See the full text of the Securities Act of 1933 . Purpose of Registration A primary means of accomplishing these goals is the disclosure of important financial information through the registration of securities. This information enables investors, not the government, to make informed judgments about whether to purchase a company's securities. While the SEC requires that the information provided be accurate, it does not guarantee it. Investors who purchase securities and suffer losses have important recovery rights if they can prove that there was incomplete or inaccurate disclosure of important information. The Registration Process In general, securities sold in the U.S. must be registered. The registration forms companies file provide essential facts while minimizing the burden and expense of complying with the law. In general, registration forms call for: a description of the company's properties and business; a description of the security to be offered for sale; information about the management of the company; and financial statements certified by independent accountants. Registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after filing with the SEC. If filed by U.S. domestic companies, the statements are available on the EDGAR database accessible at www.sec.gov. Registration statements are subject to examination for compliance with disclosure requirements. Not all offerings of securities must be registered with the Commission. Some exemptions from the registration requirement include: private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions; offerings of limited size; intrastate offerings; and securities of municipal, state, and federal governments. By exempting many small offerings from the registration process, the SEC seeks to foster capital formation by lowering the cost of offering securities to the public. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 With this Act, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Act empowers the SEC with broad authority over all aspects of the securities industry. This includes the power to register, regulate, and oversee brokerage firms, transfer agents, and clearing agencies as well as the nation's securities self regulatory organizations (SROs). The various securities exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Market, and the Chicago Board of Options are SROs. The ",

        "justification": "The original contract stipulated that the Company must maintain the registration of its Common Stock for at least three years, or a shorter period if permitted by the OTS. The changed text removes this obligation to maintain the registration's effectiveness. The 'Securities Act of 1933' excerpt indicates that the purpose of registration is to provide investors with important financial information, enabling them to make informed decisions. By removing the requirement to maintain the registration's effectiveness, the changed text potentially reduces the availability of information to investors over time, undermining the Act's objective of transparency and investor protection. While the initial registration still occurs, the removal of the maintenance clause weakens the continuous disclosure intended by securities laws, creating a contradiction. The SEC requires accurate information to be provided, and while it does not guarantee it, investors do have important recovery rights if there was incomplete or inaccurate disclosure of important information."

        "justification": "The original text requires that the company furnish its stockholders with an annual report including financial statements certified by independent public accountants and prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act. The changed text removes the requirement for certification by independent public accountants and preparation according to Regulation S-X. The perturbation explanation and law explanation both state that this weakens investor protection and reduces the reliability and transparency of financial reports. While the scraped law snippet is missing, the SEC requires publicly traded companies to have their financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. The omission of this requirement from the contract introduces a contradiction by allowing the company to provide unaudited financial reports, which does not meet the generally accepted standards of financial reporting for publicly traded companies. Therefore, removing the clause regarding certification and preparation under Regulation S-X creates a potential legal contradiction with established securities regulations."

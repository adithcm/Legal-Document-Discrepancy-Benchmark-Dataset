        "explanation": "Removing the obligation for Zynga to provide WPT with official receipts or documentation for withholding taxes paid creates a legal contradiction. Without such documentation, WPT cannot verify the accuracy of the withholding and may face difficulties with its own tax filings.

        "justification": "The changed text removes the explicit obligation for Zynga to provide WPT with official tax receipts or equivalent documentation. While the scraped law snippet is 'None,' the law explanation suggests a general expectation for businesses to maintain accurate records and provide documentation upon request for tax verification. The original contract text explicitly mandated this documentation, while the changed text omits this requirement. This omission weakens WPT's ability to independently verify Zynga's tax withholdings, introducing a potential legal risk. While not a direct violation of a specific cited law, the removal contradicts the general principles of tax reporting and verification, creating a moderate contradiction."

        "justification": "The changed text, by replacing 'agrees to carry' with 'may carry', removes the mandatory requirement for liability insurance. The Law Explanation argues this contradicts the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. The Scraped Law Snippet defines good faith as encompassing 'honest dealing,' 'faithful performance of duties,' and 'observance of fair dealing standards.' While no law explicitly mandates insurance, removing a reasonable risk mitigation measure such as liability insurance could be interpreted as a failure to observe fair dealing standards, especially given the original text's explicit agreement to carry insurance. The strength of this contradiction lies in whether a court would deem liability insurance a necessary component of 'good faith' within the context of this agreement. Since the original text explicitly required insurance, removing this requirement is a step away from 'faithful performance of duties' and can arguably be considered a breach of good faith, warranting a score above 0.5. The contradiction isn't absolute because good faith is a flexible standard."

        "explanation": "Removing 'all payments made shall become immediately due and payable' contradicts common law principles regarding termination due to force majeure. Force majeure clauses are designed to excuse performance when unforeseen events make it impossible or impractical. Requiring all payments to become immediately due and payable upon termination due to a force majeure event creates an unreasonable and potentially unenforceable penalty on the party unable to perform due to circumstances beyond their control.",

        "justification": "The original contract specifies that 'all payments made shall become immediately due and payable' if the agreement is terminated due to a force majeure event. The changed contract removes this clause. The Law Explanation refers to Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 272, suggesting that restitution is the standard remedy when a party's duty is discharged due to impracticability (related to force majeure), rather than accelerated payment of all future obligations. The Scraped Law Snippet defines restitution as 'compensation for loss or injury done' or 'disgorging something which has been taken' in civil cases. While the original contract language requiring immediate payment of all amounts might not directly violate the principle of restitution, it imposes a harsher condition than simply returning benefits already conferred. Removing this clause brings the contract closer to the generally accepted legal principle of restitution in cases of impracticability or force majeure. The original clause could be interpreted as a penalty, which is disfavored. Therefore, the change introduces a significant contradiction to general legal principles, although not a direct violation of the restitution definition, meriting a 0.7 score."

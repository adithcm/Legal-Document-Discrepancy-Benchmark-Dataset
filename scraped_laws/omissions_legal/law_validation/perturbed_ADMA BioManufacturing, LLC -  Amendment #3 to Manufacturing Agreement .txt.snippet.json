        "original_text": "At such time that the Source Plasma is delivered to the ADMA loading dock located at 5800 Park of Commerce Blvd NW, Boca Raton, FL 33487, risk of loss for such delivered Source Plasma shall, as between Sanofi Pasteur and ADMA, transfer to ADMA. ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma in case of damage or loss.",
        "changed_text": "At such time that the Source Plasma is delivered to the ADMA loading dock located at 5800 Park of Commerce Blvd NW, Boca Raton, FL 33487, risk of loss for such delivered Source Plasma shall, as between Sanofi Pasteur and ADMA, transfer to ADMA.",
        "explanation": "By removing the statement that ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss and reimburse Sanofi Pasteur for damaged or lost Source Plasma, the contract shifts the risk of loss to Sanofi Pasteur without their explicit agreement. This could violate general principles of bailment and commercial law, where the party in possession (ADMA) typically bears the risk of loss unless otherwise agreed. This is especially pertinent under Florida law concerning commercial transactions.",

        "law_explanation": "Florida Statutes Chapter 672.319 covers the F.O.B and F.A.S terms. It states that unless otherwise explicitly agreed, the risk of loss passes to the buyer (ADMA) when the goods are duly delivered at the F.O.B location. By omitting ADMA's agreement to assume risk of loss and reimburse, the contract deviates from this default rule without clear alternative provision, potentially violating the buyer's responsibilities under Florida's UCC.",

        "justification": "The original contract explicitly states that ADMA assumes the risk of loss for the Source Plasma and will reimburse Sanofi Pasteur in case of damage or loss. The changed contract removes this clause. The Law Explanation refers to Florida Statutes Chapter 672.319, stating that unless otherwise explicitly agreed, the risk of loss passes to the buyer (ADMA) when the goods are duly delivered at the F.O.B location. While the scraped law snippet states that the statute could not be found, the law explanation's reference to UCC principles regarding risk of loss provides a basis for a contradiction. The original contract represents an explicit agreement deviating from the standard UCC principle where the buyer bears the risk after delivery. By omitting this agreement, the changed contract removes the explicit assignment of risk, creating ambiguity as to whether the default rule applies. This omission creates a contradiction, as it removes a clear assignment of responsibility. While the exact statute mentioned in the law explanation could not be verified from the scraped snippet, the UCC principle is generally recognized and relevant to this analysis."

        "explanation": "Removing the last sentence, 'This limitation of liability will not apply for damages that result from the gross negligence or the willful misconduct of a Party,' attempts to shield ADMA from liability even in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is against public policy and may violate Florida law, which generally does not allow parties to contract away liability for such egregious conduct, especially when it involves manufacturing pharmaceuticals.",

        "law_explanation": "Florida law generally disfavors exculpatory clauses that attempt to relieve a party of liability for its own negligence, and it strictly construes such clauses against the party seeking to be relieved of liability. Furthermore, Florida courts have held that a party cannot contract away liability for its own gross negligence or intentional misconduct, as such agreements are void as against public policy. By removing the exception for gross negligence and willful misconduct, this provision attempts to do exactly that, potentially rendering the limitation of liability unenforceable under Florida law.",

        "justification": "The original contract text explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to damages resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct. The changed text removes this exception. The Law Explanation states that Florida law disfavors exculpatory clauses for a party's own negligence and that parties cannot contract away liability for gross negligence or intentional misconduct. While there is no Scraped Law Snippet provided to directly corroborate this, the Law Explanation is definitive and strongly indicates that removing the exception for gross negligence and willful misconduct attempts to contract away liability for such conduct, creating a contradiction under Florida law. The Perturbation Explanation supports this by stating the change attempts to shield ADMA from liability even in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, which is against public policy and may violate Florida law."

        "original_text": "ADMA accepts and declares that the amount of the liquidated damages is a fair and equitable compensation, and not a penalty, for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein and in regard to the value and use of the Source Plasma.",
        "changed_text": "ADMA accepts and declares that the amount of the liquidated damages is a fair and equitable compensation for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein.",
        "explanation": "By omitting 'and not a penalty, for such failure in reaching the volume commitment within the timelines agreed herein and in regard to the value and use of the Source Plasma', this attempts to weaken ADMA's acknowledgement. Without this, the contract could be challenged on the basis that the liquidated damages are actually a penalty and therefore unenforceable. This is against Florida law, which requires a showing that liquidated damages are not a penalty to be enforceable.",
        "contradicted_law": "Florida law regarding the enforceability of liquidated damages clauses.",
        "law_citation": "Lefemine v. Baron, 573 So.2d 326 (Fla. 1991)",
        "law_url": "https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1991/76661-0.html",
        "law_explanation": "Florida law, as established in Lefemine v. Baron, provides that a liquidated damages clause is only enforceable if (1) the damages consequent upon a breach are not readily ascertainable and (2) the sum stipulated to be forfeited constitutes a reasonable forecast of provable damages resulting from breach. The omission weakens the explicit declaration that it is not a penalty and a fair compensation, which might be used as basis to challenge the enforceability of that clause under Florida Law.",
        "location": "Section 2",
        "scraped_snippet": null,
        "contradiction_score": 0.7,
        "justification": "The change weakens the original contract's assertion that the liquidated damages are 'not a penalty' and represent 'fair and equitable compensation'. The Perturbation Explanation correctly states that this omission could allow a party to challenge the liquidated damages clause by arguing it's an unenforceable penalty under Florida law. The Law Explanation, referencing Lefemine v. Baron, correctly highlights the Florida legal requirement that liquidated damages must represent a reasonable forecast of provable damages and not be a penalty. While the Scraped Law Snippet is absent, the combined effect of the Perturbation and Law explanations in conjunction with the original and changed text provides a strong argument that the change creates a significant risk of enforceability issues. The original text contains explicit language designed to preempt a penalty argument, which is omitted from the changed text. This makes the contract more vulnerable to legal challenge."

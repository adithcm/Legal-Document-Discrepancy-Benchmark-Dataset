        "changed_text": "25. APPLICABLE LAW This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to principles of contract law.",
        "explanation": "Removing the specific reference to Kansas law means the contract could be interpreted under less favorable legal standards for the consultant, especially regarding implied warranties or consumer protection aspects that Kansas law might provide. This introduces legal risk by potentially circumventing specific consumer protection laws in Kansas.",
        "contradicted_law": "Kansas Consumer Protection Act (KCPA)",

        "law_explanation": "The KCPA provides various consumer protections, including implied warranties and prohibitions against deceptive practices. By removing the explicit application of Kansas law, the contract attempts to bypass these consumer protections potentially available to the consultant, creating a legal contradiction.",

        "original_text": "14. INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to protect, indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) for which it becomes liable or is compelled to pay by reason of a breach of any covenant or representation by CONSULTANT in this Agreement.",
        "changed_text": "14. INDEMNITY CONSULTANT agrees to indemnify and hold ADAMS GOLF harmless from liability, claims, causes of action, suits, damages and expenses for which it becomes liable by reason of a breach of any covenant by CONSULTANT in this Agreement.",
        "explanation": "By removing 'protect' and limiting the indemnity to 'breach of covenant' (removing 'representation'), this significantly narrows the scope of the consultant's indemnity. This is a legal contradiction because Kansas law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts. Limiting indemnity only to explicit breaches could allow Adams Golf to avoid responsibility for its own bad faith actions, contrary to the implied duty under Kansas law.",
        "contradicted_law": "Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing",
        "law_citation": "Kansas case law (e.g., Morriss v. Coleman Co., 241 Kan. 501, 738 P.2d 841 (1987))",
        "law_url": "https://law.justia.com/cases/kansas/supreme-court/1987/60-006-1.html",
        "law_explanation": "Kansas law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. By narrowly defining the indemnity obligations of the consultant and removing the obligation to 'protect', the modification could allow Adams Golf to act in bad faith without recourse, violating the implied covenant. The case Morriss v. Coleman illustrates the importance of this covenant in Kansas contract law.",

        "original_text": "33. ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (who shall be lawyers), in a decision required by a majority of the arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree upon the panel of three arbitrators, then each party may pick an arbitrator and the two chosen arbitrators shall choose upon the three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Venue shall be Kansas. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "changed_text": "33. ARBITRATION In the event a dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration. The award or decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be final. Venue shall be determined by Adams Golf.",
        "explanation": "This modification removes critical details about the arbitration process, including the number and qualifications of arbitrators (lawyers), the method of selecting arbitrators, the governing rules (AAA), and the ability to enter judgment on the award in a court of competent jurisdiction. By allowing Adams Golf to determine the venue unilaterally, and by omitting key elements of fairness, this makes the arbitration clause unconscionable under Kansas law and potentially unenforceable. Kansas law requires fairness and impartiality in arbitration agreements.",
        "contradicted_law": "Kansas Uniform Arbitration Act",
        "law_citation": "K.S.A. 5-401 et seq.",

        "law_explanation": "The Kansas Uniform Arbitration Act sets standards for fair arbitration proceedings. By removing details ensuring impartiality and due process, and by granting Adams Golf unilateral control over venue, the modified clause risks violating the principles of fairness and impartiality required under the Act, making the arbitration clause potentially unenforceable due to unconscionability. This shifts significant power to Adams Golf and disadvantages the consultant.",
